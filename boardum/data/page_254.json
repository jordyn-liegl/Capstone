Use your city's exclusive abilities to wage war, make allies, and achieve objectives while gaining power. Fantasy, Early Men, Thief, Modern, Utopian, and Medieval cities are all brought together in a race to victory while vying for the honor to lead this new extraordinary world.&#10;&#10;Will you choose hostility, or be the model of civility?&#10;&#10;Civility is a board game for 2 to 4 players where players get to choose a city to control. There are 6 cities to choose from - Early Men, Fantasy, Modern, Utopian, Thief, and Medieval. Each city has 4 unique abilities and different starting strengths. Different cities will require completely different strategies and planning. The goal of the game is to reach status 5. This is done by claiming status cards that have specific goals associated with them. Each status card is unique so the victory conditions will vary with each play creating a vastly different experience every time.&#10;&#10;",

Before play begins, a scratch round occurs; i.e., a roll of the dice determines which racehorses have been dropped from the race. During the course of the game if any player is unlucky enough to roll the number of a scratched horse they are forced to pay money to the pot. If, however, they roll the number of a remaining horse, that horse advances a spot to the finish.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a predetermined number of races have run or a set time has been reached. The player with the most money at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;",

You re-live a time of high adventure when reckless men staked all they had on one lucky strike.

Correct bets move your merchant forward a number of spaces (based on how risky the bet was), while incorrect bets move your merchant back to your donkey's current location. &#10;&#10;&#10;Play continues round after round until one or more players win by having both their merchant and their donkey in the city market at the end of a round.&#10;&#10;",

Although the dispute was originally about a strip of territory between the Nueces and Rio Grande Rivers, the consequence of the war stripped Mexico of what is now much of the American southwest, including California.&#10;&#10;The map consists of a number of important locations, each named for a city, and contains significant terrain features and numerical values for replenishment and morale. Units gain friction points as they move and represent a variety of factors: terrain, sickness, sagging morale, and lesser factors. Unit types are Infantry, Heavy and Field Artillery, Cavalry, Leaders, and Supply, with the combat units rated regular, seasoned, or conscript. A roster sheet allows for easy organization of friction point tallies, and the CRT is based on combat class. Some interesting rules involve a Mexican Invasion of the U.S., the Neutral Strip, the Polk Indecision Table, and the Veracruz Invasion.&#10;&#10;17&quot; x 22&quot; mapsheet, 100 counters, 10 pages of rules and charts&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "In Dragon Stripes, players test their luck as a knight approaching a dragon, with the knight trying to pick up as many gems as possible along the way. (In an earlier version of the game, Die Augen der Kali, players moved a figure toward the goddess Kali, collecting gems as they move.)&#10;&#10;Each player starts the game with 40 gems. Shuffle the deck of 51 cards: 38 footprint cards, 10 stop cards, and 3 danger cards.&#10;&#10;On a turn, the active player places the knight before the first stripe on the dragon's tail, then reveals the top card of the deck. If they reveal a footprint card, they advance the knight this many stripes toward the dragon's head, then place gems next to the knight equal to the number on the current stripe (which range from 1 to 17). The player then decides to either reveal another card or hold. In the latter situation, other players can offer to take over the current player's turn by paying them a bounty based on the number of gems currently next to the knight. If someone takes over the turn, they must reveal at least one card as the new active player; if no one does, the current active player collects all of the gems, then the next player takes their turn.&#10;&#10;If the active player reveals a stop card, they lose 1/4 of their gems (rounding down), then the knight retreats to the dragon's tail and the next player takes their turn.&#10;&#10;The first time the active player reveals a danger card, this is treated as a stop. The second danger card is also treated as a stop, but the penalty for being stopped now (and by future stop cards) is 1/2 of your gems. The reward, however, is that each time the knight moves forward, the number of gems placed next to it doubles.&#10;&#10;Dragon Stripes ends one of two ways: Either a player reveals the third danger card, which causes them to lose all of their gems, or a player moves the knight past the 17th stripe to the dragon's head, at which point they claim all gems that remain in the dragon's hoard. Either way, whoever has the most gems at this point wins.&#10;&#10;",

The Castle of each player sits in the nearest right corner of the board.&#10;The first player that captures an adversary Castle (or conquers the last piece of one colour) wins , thus ending game.&#10;&#10;Turn action: movement and capture&#10;&#10;On his turn, a player can move one of his square-shaped pieces. All the pieces (but the Castle, which as said before can not be moved) are equal to each other. Each of them can move in 4 diferent ways, according to the side of the piece facing &ldquo;north&rdquo;, north being defined as &ldquo;forward&rdquo; from the POV of the owner of the piece. So for example &ldquo;north&rdquo; for the player sitting on the east side of table will be westward, wile for the player sitting on the north side of the table it will be southward, and so on.&#10;&#10;On his turn the player can move one of his pieces in one of these &#10;2 ways:&#10;    - just rotate the piece in place (thus changing the piece movement&#10;            type for the next time he will decide to move it);&#10;    - move the piece and then (optionally) rotate it;&#10;&#10;A player can capture other players' pieces by moving one of his piece on a square occupied by an opponent's piece. Pieces can never &ldquo;go through&rdquo; or &ldquo;jump over&rdquo; other pieces, both of the same or different colours.&#10;&#10;Each piece can be oriented in four different ways (one per each side of the piece) enabling it to four different kind of movement.&#10;&#10;The active roles is the one facing &ldquo;north&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;These are the four roles a piece can assume:&#10;&#10;- Warrior:&#10;        it moves 1 square and can't go backwards, in other words it can&#10;        move to one of the 5 squares adjacent to it (W, NW, N, NE, E);&#10;- Blade:&#10;        it moves 1 or 2 square &ldquo;forward&rdquo; (N);&#10;- Catapult:&#10;        it can move up to 3 squares diagonally going only forward, as&#10;        usual (NE, NW);&#10;- Shield:&#10;        the only role that can go backwards, it can move up to 2 squares&#10;        going South or just 1 square going diagonally (SW or SE).&#10;&#10;Begining of the game&#10;&#10;The first player to move will be the one opening the table. Then it will be the player on his left the one to move, and so on, going clockwise.&#10;&#10;We advise you not to distract from what the other players do: you can lose the game even if an enemy don't conquer your Castle (one wins, all others lose).&#10;&#10;",

When they arrive at a port they pay a trading fee and draw a card which tells them what cargo they have bought.

Players could also draw a warship card - in which case any pirate who attacks them or anyone else nearby will be in for a nasty shock! The top card in each player&rsquo;s pack shows whether they are merchants, pirates or warships. Since they don&rsquo;t show each other their cards - no-one really knows what they are (until someone decides to turn pirate by attacking another ship).&#10;&#10;Players who are robbed can get their revenge by calling in the Navy and chasing the pirate down before he or she can reach Home Port! Things are made even more exciting by the &lsquo;Treasure Chest&rsquo; cards which players draw every time they roll a &lsquo;one&rsquo;.

The tiles are of six characters; The Fire-Eater, The Minstrel, The Quack, The Bishop, The Lady &amp; The Prince, each tile having a distinctive background pattern. There are 6 tiles of each, numbered from 1 to 6. The board is a simple grid of columns, having starting and finishing squares with patterns matching the tiles. Players draw 6 tiles each and place them on their starting squares, stacking them if necessary. Then they move a tile, or a stack or an upper part of a stack, up their column to the next free space.&#10;&#10;When you place a tile, if there is another player's tile on the same row with the same value, it is taken under protection of yours, by placing it under yours to make a stack. You then have another move. So if the 4 Minstrel ends on the same row as the 4 Lady, she is taken under his wing. This can be done in the finishing area too and if this reveals a tile beyond its station, that is removed as a penalty to its owner. When a tile reaches its matching finishing square, it is turned over and is done with. When only one player can move, the game ends and you score. For each tile that reached its place or beyond, you score its value, deducting any penalties. Most points wins. There is a variant using a die to control your moves.&#10;&#10;An odd movement game, with some thought and memory needed for the knock-on effect, but not a great game. Nice to look at though.&#10;&#10;",

The game is comprised of 96 playing cards consisting of either a &lsquo;FRONT&rsquo;, &lsquo;MIDDLE&rsquo;, or &lsquo;BACK&rsquo; portion of 32 particular animals.  Each animal is illustrated across the three cards, and includes a fun fact about that animal and a corresponding &lsquo;strength&rsquo; value ranging from 1-10 (e.g. a mosquito is strength-1, and a grizzly bear is strength-10).&#10;&#10;Gameplay occurs as players mix and match &lsquo;FRONT&rsquo;, &lsquo;MIDDLE&rsquo;, and &lsquo;BACK&rsquo; cards in their hand to create entirely new creatures, and stage attacks against the creatures in other players&rsquo; hands.  For example, the &lsquo;FRONT&rsquo; of Octopus (4), the &lsquo;MIDDLE&rsquo; of Hippopotamus (7), and the &lsquo;BACK&rsquo; of Armadillo (1) combine to create OC-POTA-DILLO (12)!&#10;&#10;",

In turn, each other player places a bid that differs from all other bids placed this round. The seer then decides what color wizards will count as for this round.&#10;&#10;The seer then rolls the seven dice up to three times, keeping as many dice as they like after the first and second rolls. If a non-seer's bid is met after the first or second roll, then that player places an X through their bid. If the seer has rolled three times or made their bid, all players stop. If at this point anyone has made their bid, they X the circle; otherwise they write the difference between their bid and the number of that color rolled on the dice in the circle. Instead of writing this difference, a player can cross off the number of jesters showing on the dice in the jester row, assuming the number is from 1-5 and the player has not Xed this space previously.&#10;&#10;Whoever bid the highest amount in a different color than the seer becomes the seer for the next round. The game lasts multiple rounds, ending once one or more players has nine Xs in their bidding area. Players then score points, earning 1-5 points for each successful bid and losing points for the differences they recorded. Whoever scores the most points wins!&#10;&#10;Wizard W&uuml;rfelspiel includes ten spell cards that you can optionally add to the game.

This way there should be as many discarded decks as players.&#10;&#10;When a player gets rid of a card and puts it on its deck facing up, any interested player can take it. How? The interested player should cover it with its hand. The fastest player covering the deck is the one that gets the card. This player should then discard one of his cards. Then, the game continues in a clockwise direction starting from him.&#10;&#10;This way the game continues until one of the players gathers 5 cards with the same value or 5 consecutive cards of the same race or the Unbeatable Run. The player should let the other players know during his turn by placing the discard card facing down and by showing his 5 wining cards, he gains the victory by beating his rivals.&#10;&#10;WINING COMBINATIONS:&#10;&#10;Option 1 &ndash; Whoever wins 5 games is the winner of the whole game.&#10;&#10;Option 2 &ndash; After each game all card points must be counted, except those from the winner, being 100 points those from the action cards. The player with fewer points after 5 games is the winner.&#10;&#10;Option 3 &ndash; After each game only the winner&rsquo;s points must be counted, in this situation the value (each value corresponds to a different race) of the Unbeatable Run is three times the addition of the values. The game finishes when one of the players reaches 1000 points or a previously agreed quantity.&#10;&#10;These are not the only possibilities, players can agree on other options for victory.&#10;&#10;ACTION CARDS:&#10;&#10;This game has a series of action cards which are used for the interaction between players to threaten their rivals:&#10;&#10;Skull (2 cards): If a player places this card on the other player&rsquo;s deck it means that all his troops have been killed. He must place all his cards, facing down, beneath the central deck and draw 5 new cards.&#10;&#10;card swap (1 card): If a player places this card in another player&rsquo;s deck, both players must swap one card.&#10;&#10;hand swap (1 card): Placing this card in another player&rsquo;s discard deck means that you swap your hand of cards with that player.&#10;&#10;steal 2 cards for the deck (2 cards): Placing this card on to other player&rsquo;s discard deck means that the player who has placed the card (the attacking card) randomly takes 2 cards from the other player&rsquo;s hand, and then this player must immediately pick up two new cards from the central deck. The 2 cards that have been taken from the player&rsquo;s hand must be placed beneath the central deck without looking at them.&#10;&#10;steal 3 cards for the deck (1 card): Placing this card in another player&rsquo;s discard deck means that the player who has placed the card (the assailant) randomly takes 3 cards from his rival&rsquo;s hand. Then, the rival should draw 3 new cards from the central deck. The cards taken from his hand must be placed beneath the central deck without looking at them.&#10;&#10;steal a card (3 cards): Placing this card in another player&rsquo;s discard deck means that the player who has placed the card (the assailant) randomly takes 1 card from his rival&rsquo;s hand, and keeps it. Now the victim has 4 cards, therefore he must pick up a new card to have 5. The assailant has now 6 cards therefore he must discard one of them to have 5 again to continue the battle.&#10;&#10;Potion (2 cards): the joker substitutes any other card concerning value and race. It can NOT be used as action card. One player can have on its hand up to two jokers.&#10;&#10;FAQs:&#10;&#10;- Which discard cards can I pick up? You can only pick up the last card that has been placed at the top of the discard deck from the player that&rsquo;s on its turn.&#10;&#10;- After an action card who continues? The player next to the player who has discarded the Action Card, always clockwise.&#10;&#10;- Do runs or the Unbeatable Run have to start from number 5? Runs do not have to start from 5, as long as they are always consecutive numbers.&#10;&#10;- What should it be done if the extension of Tierra Mesa cannot be cover and a player does not reach their rivals discard decks? Instead of hunting the card with the hand you should scream Guar!!! The one that screams it first takes the card.&#10;&#10;- Can I draw one card from any discard deck while other player is drawing a card from the central deck? When a player picks up a card from the central deck the possibility of taking a card from a discard deck is blocked.&#10;&#10;- If I take a card from a discard deck, can the card that appears underneath be taken later on? NO. Those cards were previously played, therefore, you should pay attention!!&#10;&#10;- What should it be done when the central deck finishes? All discard decks from all the players must be gathered together to form a new central deck. The cards must be shuffle before placing them on the middle of Tierra Mesa.&#10;&#10;- If two players place their hands on a discard deck, who takes the card? Either the one that has more fingers placed on it, or the most aggressive one.&#10;&#10;",

The problem is, the self destruction sequence has been set by the ship's AI running wild, and that same AI is still trying to stop the players from fleeing. To successfully flee, the players have to activate the escape pod by turning on 13 switches all over the ship. To reach the switches they have to unlock the doors that block the way between them.&#10;&#10;The way all this happens is simple: on your turn you can either roll the dice to unlock doors on your half of the ship OR move your astronaut through doors that have previously been unlocked. You try to reach the switches to be able to turn them on. Sometimes you roll a dice combination that you cannot use. When that happens you have to draw a card that may lock unlocked doors, or deactivate activated switches. To win the game, all astronauts have to reach the escape pod in the center of the board before the time has run out, after all switches have been turned on.&#10;&#10;The game is played using a free timer app downloaded to a smartphone. The timer also plays atmospheric sounds that remind the players of the urgency of the situation.&#10;&#10;",
