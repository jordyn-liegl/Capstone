It&rsquo;s a hilarious game about playing irreverently with words and meanings.&#10;&#10;The game comes with 100 prompt cards and 375 answer cards. In each round, one player serves as a judge and reads aloud a question or fill-in-the-blank prompt. The other players submit answer cards, each containing a verbatim quotation from Shakespeare, as suggested completions for the prompt. The judge reads all the submissions aloud and chooses the best one, construing &ldquo;best&rdquo; however he or she sees fit. The winner keeps the prompt card, everybody replenishes their answer cards, and the role of judge rotates to the next player. At the end of the game, whoever has the most prompt cards wins.&#10;&#10;The game depends on understanding the particular wit of the other players and strategically playing answers to appeal to each round's judge. The sheer linguistic playfulness of Shakespeare&rsquo;s text is what makes the game exciting and hilarious.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "In the year 431BC, the Greek world was dominated by the Athenian Empire, due to their naval supremacy of the Aegean. Only the Spartans dared to challenge their might through the strength of their unsurpassed Hoplite troops. The result was a 30-year conflict that ended in the destruction of Greek dominance in the ancient world.&#10;&#10;Two to four players use military force and political influence in their struggle to control the city-states of ancient Greece. Playing time ranges from 4-10 hours for short scenarios, to 20+ hours for the full campaign game, as players mobilize forces four times a year, and deploy them three times each season. As the leader of the Athenian Empire, can you save Athens' glory from the Spartan onslaught? As the leader of the Peloponnesian League, can you free Greece from Athenian tyranny without destroying it in the process?&#10;&#10;Players have a full range of strategic options, including sieges, constructing and destroying fortifications, razing enemy cities, foraging and raiding. Event Cards provide both random events (such as storms at sea, bad omens, the crippling plague at Athens, etc.) and strategic targets (city betrayals, rebellion of Athenian regions, Persian support, the Sicilian Expedition, among others).&#10;&#10;Fleet units represent 25 triremes, the light war galleys of the ancient Mediterranean, plus associated transport vessels. Hoplite units represent 1,000 heavily-armored Greek infantrymen. Each cavalry unit represents about 400 men and horses. Light infantry includes all types of lightly armored foot soldiers, including missile troops and barbarians, with each unit representing between 1,000 and 5,000 men.&#10;&#10;The rules allow for historically accurate periods of peace, where both sides caught their breath while preparing for a renewed struggle. The Epic of the Peloponnesian War is a complete simulation of this conflict.&#10;&#10;Scenarios include the introductory Argive League scenario, played on only a portion of the map; three scenarios each covering only a portion of the war; and the full Campaign Game for 2-4 players (adding Thebes and Corinth to the Peloponnesian side as the third and fourth players).&#10;&#10;",

George Armstrong Custer and most of his command at the Battle of the Little Bighorn. This two-player game covers that entire campaign.&#10;&#10;One player commands Army forces, including the regiments and battalions forming the three commands that participated in the original campaign: Crook&rsquo;s, Gibbon&rsquo;s and Terry&rsquo;s. The other player controls various Indian tribes, each rated for its fighting strength in warriors. The point-to-point map stretches from Fort Abraham Lincoln in the Dakotas to Helena, Montana. In between are famous historic battle sites such as Powder River, the Rosebud, and the Little Bighorn.&#10;&#10;Custer&rsquo;s Final Campaign is part of the Hand of Destiny mini-game series. Each player has a unique deck of Campaign Cards. They generate movement abilities, combat bonuses and historical events. Accessing the right card at the right time lets the player concentrate forces to win that great victory against all odds&mdash;or perhaps go down to inglorious defeat. Some of the cards include: Tribal Raiding, Indians Leave Reservation, and Gary Owen.&#10;&#10;Combat is resolved via a quasi-tactical procedure. There are special rules for: Gatling guns, &ldquo;dog soldiers,&rdquo; Army riverboats, and leaders such as Crazy Horse, Nelson Miles, Sitting Bull and Custer himself.&#10;&#10;",

Each gang member is represented by one miniature on the table, customized and painted by yourself. As you play more and more games of Gangs of Mega-City One, your gang will become more powerful, recruiting new members, hiring specialists and buying superior weapons and equipment on the black market. The goal of each player in this game is to defeat the gangs of his opponents, through a mixture of skill and raw luck, building up his own gang in the process.&#10;&#10;The more you play Gangs of Mega-City One, the better your street gang will become &ndash; even if you lose a fight, your gang members will at least have learned something and they may not be so quick to suffer defeat again in the future! As a gang grows, it will not just recruit more members and earn more credits. As it spreads its influence beyond its own block, the gang will begin to dominate more turf, gaining a sizable reputation within Mega-City One&rsquo;s criminal circles. Canny players will use this to gain access to incredibly powerful weaponry or hire extremely skilled specialists who will swing the balance of any confrontation in their favor.&#10;&#10;As well as developing the street gang as a whole, players will also have a chance to build up the skills and capabilities of each individual member. Young juves have much to learn but the street is a harsh teacher. Those who survive will stand to become among the greatest of all gang members. Even gang leaders will develop new skills and traits that will ensure they are far harder to defeat in a rumble.&#10;&#10;Gangs of Mega-City One allows you to see your gang grow from a group of disenfranchised and bored young punks to the greatest criminal masterminds Mega-City One has ever seen!&#10;&#10;Each box set contains the full colour rulebook, 12 plastic Street Gang miniatures, a full set of card buildings and a floor plan that will have you fighting for turf within minutes!&#10;&#10;Replaced by:&#10;&#10;     Judge Dredd Miniatures Game&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "By the hundreds, creatures are emigrating from the Old World in search of hope and prosperity. The New World offers endless opportunity, but only to those who arrive first. In this clever new game by designer Joe Cannon, players seek out territories to conquer and compete for the most fertile properties, making critical decisions to gain the advantage. This set will provide the basic rules and set you up for future expansions, which will exponentially increase the elements of story and strategy.&#10;&#10;Migration is a game suitable for 2-4 players, in which each player takes the role of multiple anthropomorphic animals migrating to a new continent. Players take turns to place an animal token on the board, representing towns. Each new town must originate from the last town placed (with certain exceptions). Each animal token has a unique ability, introducing a high degree of strategy. The game is over when no player is able to make a legal move, and points are scored for each town on the board. The player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;This entry is for the version of Migration printed by Thegamecrafter.com&#10;IF YOU HAVE THE VERSION OF MIGRATION THAT CAME FROM KICKSTARTER, PLEASE PUT YOUR RATING HERE: https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/158122/migration-book-ii-saga-conflict&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Welcome to 1950s USA &mdash; the era of huge cars, rock 'n' roll, and alien activity! To prevent a mass panic, the President has ordered his generals to store all evidence of the existence of aliens.&#10;&#10;In Area 51, a secret military base in the Nevada desert, players store all the futuristic weapons, unbelievable tools, and alien corpses in high-end storage facilities. However, this base is capable of hiding only certain artifacts and must be improved all the time. The generals try to outperform each other in building and upgrading the facilities and the infrastructure in addition to finding the optimal logistics for storing the artifacts to please the President.&#10;&#10;In Area 51: Top Secret, players encounter several categories of artifacts &mdash; ships, weapons, tools, etc. &mdash; which are numbered 1-4 to show how dangerous they are (and therefore what security level is needed to store them).&#10;&#10;Players must build storage facilities to store these artifacts. Artifact cards need to be collected, but the decisive element in the game is that once a player chooses to pick up a pile of artifact cards to place them into storage facilities, they need to store ALL cards possible, including those that will score points for the other players. The main strategy of the game is thus to use the existing storage facilities and transportation vehicles to optimize one's own scoring.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "&quot;Armor at Kursk - Battle of Prochorovka&quot;, covers the largest single tank battle in the history of warfare. Approximately 1400 tanks and assault guns met head to head near the town of Prochorovka, in a battle that became a desperate close range shoot-out which would decide the ultimate sucess or failure of Operation Zitadelle.&#10;&#10;The 2nd SS Panzer Korps began it's attack on July 3rd, and spent the next 8 days breaking through the dense Russian defensive positions. During the late afternoon and evening of the 11th, they broke through and replused a counterattack by the Russian 31st Tank Corps. Reorganizing during the night, the panzers struck northward before dawn on the 12th. As dawn broke, the lead German elements ran head-on into the lead elements of the Soviet 5th Gaurds Tank Army and the battle was on. It was to last all day, in confused and savage fighting at close ranges. In the end, the Russians were driven back from the town, but the Germans were unable to push them any further. Losses exceeded three hundred tanks on each side.&#10;&#10;&#10;This wargame was first published as one of the Task Force Games Pocket Games.  It was later released in a boxed version with the name on the cover shortened to Armor at Kursk.&#10;&#10;Units are German Battalions and Russian Regiments &amp; Brigades, though all are similar in size and manpower. Hexes are 400 meters across, turns represent one hour.&#10;&#10;",

Each card has a value and a ranking, the highest ranking card will earn a &quot;Quest.&quot;&#10;&#10;At the beginning of each round each player must announce how many quests they expect to complete. If the correct number of Quests is achieved a player earns 100 Gold per Quest.&#10;&#10;If a player earns too many or not enough Quests they will earn less gold, or have to pay gold.&#10;&#10;The card ranks consist of four suits of cards numbered 1-14.

    "description": "Designed, hilariously illustrated and captioned by Jamie Noble Frier,&nbsp;Hero Master: An Epic Game of Epic Fails&nbsp;is a humorous card game of dysfunctional dungeoneering. As one of Snoozehaven&rsquo;s worst adventurers you&rsquo;ll be squabbling over the right to be the Party Leader, avoiding the &ldquo;take-that&rdquo; of the bungling buffoons around you and trying to get enough gold to leave behind your failure-fraught-fellowship. You&rsquo;ll have to manage both your hand and your expectations... you guys really are terrible.&#10;&#10;You&rsquo;ve never really managed it as a hero. In fact, you&rsquo;ve been the undoing of many a quest. Half of the parties you&rsquo;ve adventured with ended up trapped in a cave-in you triggered, skewered by a trap you detonated or cooked by a monster you thought you could converse with. Somehow you have always ended up leaving unscathed, eager to join another party and change this streak of &lsquo;bad luck&rsquo;. It seems now though, just as a dragon has come to Snoozehaven and heroes look to band together, that your reputation has begun to precede you. As the numbers dwindle in the tavern and heroes sing their way to battle, you realise your hopes rest with the no-hopers sat around you. You&rsquo;re just pleased that you&rsquo;re probably going to be the party leader&hellip;&#10;&#10;Hero Master: An Epic Game of Epic Fails&nbsp;is a parody dungeon crawler card game, with much deeper strategy than may first appear from it's comedic art style and playful humour.&#10;&#10;Each player begins the game by drawing from race and class cards. Giving each player different special abilities, decks of cards, weapons and armour based on the mixture of the character they randomly generate. Each combination allows for a different synergy of humorous attacks and bungles that reflect a character&rsquo;s personality as they desperately strive to become respected as an adventurer.&#10;&#10;Players will be trying to get the most gold by the end of the game. Maybe that way one of the &quot;real adventuring parties&quot; will take them on...&#10;&#10;Along with gold, some monsters will drop valuable treasure which may give the heroes the edge over the painfully pathetic party members.&#10;&#10;Players will find the key to the game is keeping hold of the title of Party Leader, but it won't be easy... These calamitous cretins can't stand to be told what to do!&#10;&#10;With so much disruption and chaos, mistakes will be made, often at the risk of those nearby. Attacks are resolved using a D20, and bungles increase the chance of a critical fail. So be careful, as a party prone to accidents, you don't want to be standing too close when an axe swing is&nbsp; wildly off target!&#10;&#10;In a game of fast flying dice, jockeying for first position and strategic card play, anything can happen. The heroes just need to stick together until they defeat the dragon, then they can go their separate ways.... Which hopefully won&rsquo;t be into the dragon&rsquo;s stomach.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Each edge of a building card has a semi-circle on it showing half of a source symbol. Cards also have complete symbols for strength, faith, and food on them.&#10;&#10;Each player starts the game with two project cards &mdash; cards fueled by source tokens &mdash; and an empty 3&times;3 grid that shows semi-circular source symbols around the edges. The game lasts four rounds, and in each round you draft three cards. At the end of the second, third, and fourth rounds, all players compare their strengths in various horizontal or vertical rows on their grid.&#10;&#10;In the first round, you draft three project cards, each with special effects that can be used if you fill all the source symbols on it. In each of the next three rounds, you draft and play three building cards. When you play a building card and complete one or more source symbols (by matching the colors on each half symbol), you receive a source token of that color for each completed symbol, which you must immediately place on a project.&#10;&#10;After the third, sixth, and ninth building cards have been placed, you compare your strength in the row or column indicated on battle cards. (You have two such challenges after rounds six and nine.) The player with the most strength in the appropriate row or column receives 3 achievement points (AP), while the loser marks that row or column with a damage token. If a building card has damage in both its row and column, it's destroyed and removed from the game.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, players feed their city, scoring based on the number of food symbols they have and the number of non-destroyed buildings. Players also score AP for faith symbols in their city.&#10;&#10;M&#197;&#171; also contains rules for a solitaire game.&#10;&#10;",

But the humans are always auctioned off first, and those who can&rsquo;t or don&rsquo;t want to bid any longer take the current pool of treasures and the card that is currently being bid on. Who will be the cleverest and fill their own dungeon with powerful monsters that will defeat the humanoid intruders?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

Each side of the paper shows an area with 13 hexagons, each filled with a number, surrounded by a ring of 16 hexagons, each filled with a color. Start on whichever side you want; you use both during play.&#10;&#10;On a turn, the active player rolls three dice, then can re-roll any number of dice once. Each die has the numbers 1-6 with a different color on each side. After the roll, all players use these dice to mark off hexes on their sheet. For each die, you can use either the number or the color; additionally, you can sum numbers on the dice, which will be required since the numbers in the hexes go up to 12.&#10;&#10;However, once you mark a colored hexagon, you can mark only the adjacent colored hexagons from that point on. Similarly, when you first mark a number, circle that number. The next number you mark must be in an adjacent hex; draw a line that connects this number to the circle. With each subsequent number marked, you must extend the line, never crossing it or revisiting a marked space.&#10;&#10;If the active player can't use all three dice, they mark a misthrow box on their sheet; the same is true for non-active players who don't use at least two dice. When you mark all three misthrow boxes, flip your sheet, then start marking the other side on the next turn; you can also choose to flip your sheet before you get three misthrows.&#10;&#10;When any player has three misthrows on their second side, the game ends, and players tally their points for each side, summing those values. The more hexes you mark off, the better your score!&#10;&#10;",

The Roman Empire has collapsed and a new power, the Byzantine Empire, has just begun its 1000 year history in Constantinople. The West clamors for goods from the East: Silk and Paper from China; Resins and Emeralds from Arabia; Wheat, Glass, Linen and Ivory from Egypt and Spices (pepper, cloves, nutmeg, cinnamon, etc), Dyes, Gums, Mordants and Incense from India.&#10;&#10;Amber, Gold and Silver, along with many crafted manufactures, flow from and through the major trading cities of Constantinople and Istakhr to the people of the East.&#10;&#10;As the head of a trading family, you wish to extend your influence and gain interest in the great Trading Families through the marriage of your children and grandchildren into those families. Great gifts are expected with each marriage, but you expect to gain from each new alliance with other families through your shared profits.&#10;&#10;As new trade routes are established, profits are made and paid. The marriage price you pay to acquire an interest in another Trading Family should not be too low, or they will not have the financial resources to grow fruitfully.

Existen dos bandos por los que se puede jugar: la alianza de Per&uacute; y Bolivia o Chile.&#10;&#10;El objetivo del juego es lograr 10 puntos de victoria o tomar una de las capitales enemigas, quien logre primero una de esas dos metas se procalama vencedor.&#10;&#10;El juego tiene varias din&aacute;micas: la primera de estrategia b&eacute;lica con movimiento de tropas y de los barcos hist&oacute;ricos del conflicto, la segunda de estrategia pol&iacute;tico-diplom&aacute;tica para conseguir ventajas de combate o de otra clase, y la tercera una dimensi&oacute;n heroica, con diferentes personajes hist&oacute;ricos a escoger que modifican la mec&aacute;nica del juego, como Grau, Prat, Avaroa, Bolognesi, Baquedano, Pinto, entre otros.&#10;&#10;El objetivo del juego es que contemplar la guerra de hace dos siglos desde un punto de vista distinto, con serenidad y esp&iacute;ritu l&uacute;dico-educativo. Es hora de ver episodios de nuestra historia con la distancia y reflexi&oacute;n que el tiempo otorga, sin animadversiones nacionales y en una mesa donde reine la camarader&iacute;a.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Mondriaan 2020 is a tile-placement game in which players create abstract images over the course of the game that resemble the work of Dutch artist Piet Mondrian (whose last name was originally spelled &quot;Mondriaan&quot;). But the players aren't working collaboratively &ndash; no, they want to make strong color connections for their own glory.&#10;&#10;One player starts with a yellow tile, the other with a red tile. Twenty-one other tiles have some combination of red, blue and yellow on them, with each corner being a solid color. One tile is placed randomly on the table as a starting tile, and the other tiles are randomly distributed between the two players.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player adds one tile to the layout. The tile must be adjacent to at least one tile already on the board, and the colors of the just-placed tile must match all adjacent tiles, even if they touch only at a corner. The player scores points by adding to colored areas already on the board; he scores one point for each tile in a colored area that he adds to, while scoring no points for the tile just placed. (The starting player begins with five points.)&#10;&#10;A player must add a tile to the layout on his turn, discarding a tile instead if one can't be placed. After all tiles have been placed or discarded, the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Re-implemented as: TRIFUSION, allowing up to 4 players.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "From the Publisher:&#10;&#10;Noble House is a game based on the novel by James Clavell. In this game, players take the part of the Tai-Pans of major corporations doing business in Hong Kong in the early 1960's, as portrayed in the Clavell book. Each player is head of a large business conglomerate and is striving to be the most influential and powerful leader in the Hong Kong business community. The route to power lies in the manipulations of the stock market, banks, and holding companies, and other typical corporate skull duggery.&#10;&#10;Synopsis of play:&#10;&#10;During a turn, players draw event cards, which can be used in many ways to affect one's own future, or the future of an opponent. Players then buy and sell stocks on a volatile stock market, which can fluctuate due to purchase and sale of stocks, failed contracts, or even loss of face (bad faith deals). Contracts are then announced, and if a player has sufficient assets, and can maintain those assets, lots of money can be made. Unfulfilled contracts go up for a general bid amongst the players. Players can then attempt to acquire loans from 3 Hong Kong banks, but, if the Bank Directors, or their proxies, so vote, a player can simply be denied a loan. Furthermore, bank directors, in the person of voting cards held by players, can call in outstanding loans, which must be immediately paid. Players now purchase various assets, such as airlines, railroads, shipping lines, industry, land, and human services, which the player must have to fulfill contractual obligations. Players can buy their own assets, or even lease them from other players. All possible wheeling and dealing is allowed, and no one is ever required to keep his or her end of a bargain. Lastly, if a player's stock falls far enough, and they have been unfortunate enough to lose enough of their own &quot;voting&quot; stock, they can be voted out of the game, which will end the game at the end of that phase. Otherwise, the game ends on the turn when the last event card is drawn.&#10;&#10;",

The Vector starts in the middle of the board, which is ruled off in squares.  Direction cards are played face up in turn, then all players secretly select a Distance card.  These are revealed simultaneously, and the Vector moved by each player according to the Direction/Distance cards they played.  After all players have moved the Vector, a new round begins with the Vector in the current location and a new first player.&#10;&#10;Many of the squares contain actions (plus/minus scoring, mandatory Vector redirects, lost turns, etc.) that are performed when the Vector ends a player's turn there.  Scores are totaled after 12 rounds of play, leveling out the advantage of being the first to move the Vector.&#10;&#10;To add some tension, each player has a &quot;Goal&quot; of three squares on their side of the board.  When a goal is scored, by moving the vector into it, the player to whom the goal belongs immediately doubles their score - whether positive or negative - and the game ends.&#10;&#10;As with similar blind action games (Basari, Dragon Delta, Robo Rally to name a few), astutely predicting your opponents' intent and disguising your own is the key.  It takes some analysis to determine all the possible options, but not so much as to cause paralysis.  Guessing right three times and scoring big when playing last in a round is very satisfying!  The constant surprises due to bluffs and doublethink make this a light, entertaining game.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Cartooner is a new experience in drawing games, a game that combines storytelling and drawing. It is like Once Upon a Time plus Pictionary, with story prompts that are inspired by popular and quirky comics themes and trends. While this is a game about drawing, it's not a game in which the best artist wins as your strategy and ability to adapt quickly matters much more. Points are awarded for strategy and following the rules, not artistic ability. However, if you are an artist, it is undeniable that Cartooner can be a great companion for you as well. A solo mode has been designed just for that.&#10;&#10;The game plays out in four rounds that build up in intensity, and each round is five minutes long. Your goal is to get the most fame points at each round using a combination of your theme cards and the fleeting market trends that are valid only for one round. In the end, the player with the most fame wins&hellip;but every player walks away with a comic of their own creation.&#10;&#10;Start by drawing three theme cards at random to determine what your comic will be about. Will your comic involve Dinosaurs, Secret Hideouts and Car Chases? Werewolves, Obnoxious Coworkers and The Desire to Be Famous? Or Pirates, Blobs and The Last Human on Earth? When time is up, follow these simple rules to score the game:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Rule 1: You get 1 Fame point for each Theme you express in your comic in a way the other players can recognize by drawing it or writing it in a word balloon. &#10;    Rule 2: You get 2 Fame for drawing something in every Panel, no matter how simple. &#10;    Rule 3: You get 2 more Fame for keeping it succinct by using three or fewer Word Balloons on the page. It's that easy.&#10;&#10;&#10;Rounds two through four introduce an element of strategy: Trend Cards. Each Trend Card gives you new ways to earn Fame points for that round. Unlike Themes, which are personal, Trend Cards represent the market and affect every player in the game. Your fickle readers may want you to inject Superheroes, Funny Animals, Medical drama, Disaster stories, Mystery,  Romance, or any one of 52 Trends into your story. It's every artist's dilemma: stick to your original story, or sell out for Fame?&#10;&#10;Each round brings more Panels to draw and Trends to chase. Plus, each round has more Fame in play than the round before, so the outcome is up in the air until the very end.&#10;&#10;When the final round ends, the winner is the one with the most Fame Tokens, but every player ends the game with their own comic.&#10;&#10;With literally hundreds of thousands of possible combinations of story prompts, you'll never run out of ideas.&#10;&#10;",

But beware because Neptune's ex-mermaid also lies in wait for a good catch &mdash; and it seems many a diver has disappeared from the seabed. Ahoy there!&#10;&#10;Bermuda is a cooperative game in which all players dive together. You play against time.

But alas, our culture is now limited to the action movies of the end of 20th century / early 21st century and many of those recordings have deteriorated.&#10;&#10;This week you have finally been selected: Guns, attitude and bluffing will be necessary to fulfill your destiny!&#10;&#10;In Badass Force, the goal is to be the first to achieve 16 victory points on the badassometer. Points are earned by eliminating the opposing characters, but a player is NEVER ELIMINATED from the game.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, seven different characters are selected from the ten in the box. Each player retrieves a copy of each of these seven characters and a weapon card. Players then choose a character from their hand and put it face down in front of them. In turn, a player will increase the level of charge of their weapon AND choose an action from five options (changing characters / changing weapons / fetching ammunition by throwing the 2 weapons dice / using their weapon / announcing a Character to use their power): everyone plays in turn order until a winner is declared.&#10;&#10;Badass Force is a thematic game, with strong interaction in which one must use bluffing, guessing, hand management, and a little tactics to succeed and being declared the most Badass of all!&#10;&#10;",

If you play the only dog, for example, you collect all cats on the table and all cats played that turn; if multiple people play dogs, the strongest valued dog wins; if players play dogs of the same value, then those are ignored and the next strongest dog wins.

This substance acts directly on gravity and space-time, affecting the laws of physics through its unique properties, and reshaping the rules that apply to the rest of the universe.&#10;&#10;A few thousand years ago, a collision with an asteroid almost shattered the planet, which now holds together only thanks to the power of the Ether. Since this cataclysm, the planet's landscape has become a succession of inhospitable platforms gravitating to the rhythm of cosmic currents. Born of this collision, six natural satellites - Mauhea, Reces, Hivalia, Ertis, Meinas and Psolos - orbit Etherium in a chaotic ballet. These moons' erratic revolutions disrupt the rhythm of the seasons and strongly influence the development of life on Etherium. A calendar year sees the seasons pass in random order, making it difficult for life to develop.&#10;&#10;Each of these moons is home to a people with very specific characteristics. These orbiting microcosms have developed a unique relationship with Etherium, which has significantly shaped their evolution.&#10;&#10;Strongly linked, the natural satellites are connected to Etherium by gravity-defying etheric corridors, allowing the various people to move easily to the mother planet in the hope of harvesting the precious Ether.&#10;&#10;All people need Ether to develop, but it exists in only one place on Etherium, within reach of all hands and at the center of all greed. Until now, the balance has been maintained, but as all people become more eager each passing season, everything is about to change.&#10;&#10;&#10;The 3D board of Etherium is made of cardboard &quot;boxes&quot;, easy to set up &amp; to store for each game. 6 tribes to mix &amp; play, with their own unique abilities.&#10;&#10;Each turn, which represents a season, players will program their actions (7 seasons to play): development, attack or defense, resource optimization or mitigate luck, and even production.&#10;&#10;Multiple victory conditions: earn victory points in many different ways through the game.&#10;&#10;&#10;     victory tokens in limited quantity to earn&#10;     special abilities to develop, units to upgrade&#10;     and of course, Ether you gather&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "&ldquo;Never any young adventurer's misfortunes, I believe, began sooner, or continued longer than mine.&rdquo; &#10;&#226;&#128;&#149; Daniel Defoe, Robinson Crusoe&#10;&#10;Three centuries ago, a singular story perfectly captured the drama of shipwreck and survival, hope and redemption. That story was Robinson Crusoe. Now this timeless tale is brought to life once more in a dynamic card game, but this time you are the one who needs to survive and make it off the island.    &#10;This ancient tale it&rsquo;s alive again!&#10;&#10;In 1651 a young man leaves home for an adventure at sea. He is shipwrecked on an island, 40 miles out to sea. He spends the next 28 years on this island, gathering food, resources, and tools, and battling against insurmountable odds to stay alive. He hunts, raises animals, reads the bible, and begins to turn his focus and attention inward. He becomes a man of God, and learns to accept his fate, growing spiritually. He realizes that he has everything he needs to survive and live in peace.&#10;&#10;Combining themes of hope, strength, and resiliency, this strategic, multi-layered game will test your skills in more ways than one, as you navigate through cannibal attacks, deadly storms, and your own inner turmoil.&#10;&#10;Robinson Crusoe: Escape from Despair Island is a fast-paced, family-friendly game for 1-4 players, ages 14 and up. Offering a new gameplay experience every time, with vibrant art on 160 cards, push-your-luck mechanics, and the age-old theme of survival and escape, it will leave you wondering if you have what it takes to make it home alive.&#10;&#10;Game Play&#10; The deck is shuffled, and every player is dealt five cards face down. These cards represent the players&rsquo; food supply, with one card being equal to one day's worth of food.&#10;&#10;The game proceeds in a clockwise direction and includes two phases of play during each player&rsquo;s turn - the exploration phase, and the market phase.&#10;&#10;During exploration phase the active player draws cards from the deck in order to take one card either food card or some camp cards to their camp. Market phase opens for other players once the active player has chosen what card to take.&#10;&#10;Pay every turn&#10;&#10;At the beginning of every turn, a player must discard one food card into the discard pile. This is the cost of playing the game and represents one day's food supply being used up.&#10;&#10;Exploration turn&#10;&#10;During exploration turn, players take turns flipping cards to find the resources they need. You can think of each flipped card as a new resource or ability your character has uncovered. A player can flip up to 10 cards. The aim of the exploration phase is to find food and resources and to build the camp and character. Ultimately the goal is to escape from the island.&#10;&#10;After a maximum of ten cards have been flipped, the active player chooses which card they are going to keep, leaving the remaining cards on the table for the other players to buy.&#10;&#10;There are two ways to take cards from the drawn cards&#10;&#10;1) Harvest food cards i.e cards with a green palm tree symbol on the top left and a food icon on the bottom right. When harvesting, take the indicated amount of food from draw deck and place the food card on the discard pile.&#10;&#10;2) Take camp cards such as construction cards with a brown upper left corner symbol on the top left, character cards with a blue upper left corner symbol, or resource cards with upper left corner left green palm tree corner symbol, other than food cards, to your camp if you meet the requirements.&#10;&#10;The camp can consist of items like a hut, palisade, box or boat, as well as resources such as a rifle, an axe or gunpowder. Character growth and actual character cards are also placed in the camp. When a player builds an item in their camp, the card is placed image side up on the table in front of the player.&#10;&#10;A player can continue flipping cards until either:&#10;&#10;a) they have flipped a total of ten cards, in which case the player is forced to decide what card to take, or &#10;b) they decide to stop and take some of the flipped cards to their camp, or alternatively harvest food when the food card is discarded and food cards are taken from the draw deck, or&#10;c) they flip a total of two threat cards which from the player cannot defeat the more difficult one.&#10;&#10;Defeat the threats&#10;&#10;If a second threat card is flipped, the player must then defeat the greater of the two threats (denoted by 1, 2, or 3 skulls in the top right corner of the card) if they want to take some flipped card from the table to the camp.&#10;&#10;The threat is defeated by having the cards listed on the card&rsquo;s &quot;requirement row&quot;. Each card has its own symbol. In the above example player have no any cards in the camp, so the exploration turn is over for that player and player do not get to keep any of the cards they have flipped.&#10;&#10;If the player is able to defeat the threat, the card is placed on the discard pile, and they can either continue the exploration phase and drawing cards, or take the indicated amount of food cards and add them to their pile. The options available after defeating the threat are visible on the bottom of the card where there are card deck icon OR food icon with number.&#10;&#10;Build your camp&#10;&#10;When building the camp by taking a construction unit like a boat using an axe and wood, the wood is discarded (it has the finite symbol '1') while axe is not discarded (it has the infinite symbol &infin;).&#10;&#10;With every draw you risk encountering threats and losing food, but the one thing you need the most could be waiting under the next card. How far will you go to survive?&#10;&#10;There are many decisions to be made:&#10;&#10;1) Stop flipping cards earlier, and minimize the chance for other players to buy the cards they need during the market phase.&#10;2) Keep flipping, and you have a better chance of finding the cards you need, allowing you to gain more food from other players who want to buy these cards from you later. But push your luck too far and you will be defeated by the second threat card, which you cannot defeat. &#10;3) Push for consistent development of your resources and character, or grow your food pile first and purchase more helpful cards later?&#10;4) Grow your food pile aggressively, and risk losing half of them if a bad luck card shows up. &#10;5) Use up your food supplies as you go, and you may find them doubled if a good luck card appears.&#10;&#10;Market phase&#10;&#10;After player has done his exploration turn, the market phase starts. Moving in a clockwise direction, all other players are now given the opportunity to buy any cards that are left from the exploration phase.&#10;&#10;The cost of each card is denoted by a number in the top right corner, which represents the number of food cards the buying player must then discard to acquire the card. On top of this number, the buying player must also give one food card to the selling player.&#10;&#10;If there is no number in the top right corner (as with the goat card) then the buying player does not need to discard any food cards, but they do still need to give the selling player one food card as payment.&#10;&#10;The market phase continues until all the cards have been bought or the players do not want to buy any more. Any cards left on the table at the end of the market phase are then placed in the discard pile.&#10;&#10;Grow your character&#10;&#10;It will take more than just food and shelter to keep player alive. Player will need to teach, pray, and read to build up character, and better the odds of escaping alive. By collecting character growth cards, a player can get characters, which give effects and open up paths to victory.&#10;&#10;Victory paths&#10;&#10;a) Beacon Campfire victory path, either with the Man of God character card or with a camp of 18 victory points &#10;b) Escape the Island victory path, either with the Teacher character card or with a camp of 18 victory points &#10;c) Victory point strategy, by having the Wise Man character plus 25/20/17 VPs (4/3/2 players)&#10;&#10;Beacon campfire&#10;&#10;You could draw the attention of a rescue ship, but you will need to become a Man of God OR build a camp with at least 18 VPs and find wood and gunpowder to build a fire.&#10;&#10;Escape from the Island&#10;&#10;You can set your sights on building a boat, but you will need to find Friday and teach him how to help you.&#10;&#10;Victory point&#10;&#10;Finally, you can pray and read to become a wise man and build up your victory points to beat the other players.&#10;&#10;Game ends&#10;&#10;The game ends in either of the following situations:&#10;&#10;a) When the draw deck has been played through twice, in which case the player with the most victory points (VPs) wins&#10;b) When any player achieves one of the three winning strategies: Beacon Campfire, Escape the Island or Victory points.&#10;&#10;Explanation of card types&#10;&#10;Food cards: There are two kind of food cards, regular food cards and food &amp; resource combo cards, such as wood and goat, that player can use either as a food card (harvested like other food cards) or as a resource card (placed in the camp like regular resource cards). These are necessary in order to maintain an adequate food supply.&#10;&#10;Resource cards: Resource cards have two kinds, regular resources like axe and wood, and food &amp; resource combo cards (see above).&#10;&#10;Construction cards: There are two kinds of construction cards, regular ones and combo ones, combo having two construction units in the same card. These cards are important for protecting yourself and also enabling some victory paths.&#10;&#10;Exploration cards allow a player to take extra cards or double the amount of food collected, which boosts the exploration phase significantly.&#10;&#10;Good &amp; Bad luck cards: Good luck cards give 4 food to the player with the least food cards. Bad luck cards force players with more than 6 food to lose half of their food cards. Both of these cards are enforced as soon as they are drawn.&#10;&#10;Character cards: There are two types of character cards, character growth cards and character cards. Growth ones are important prerequisite cards for the actual character cards, Man of God, and Wise man cards. They are necessary not only for protection, but are also requirements for special victory scenarios.&#10;&#10;The special character card Friday helps to protect the player against many threats. It also allows for an additional card to be drawn when exploring, but it also forces you to pay one more food when you buy.&#10;&#10;Victory cards: Cards like Beacon Campfire and Escape the Island are key victory cards.&#10;&#10;Said about the game&#10;&#10;&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re looking for something that re-creates the high drama of it&rsquo;s subject matter&hellip;it does a really great job.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;&ndash; Rahdo&#10;&#10;&ldquo;The design and the art...

Each has a separate colored unit box for ease of identification. The Allies are controlled by the game system. As the player, your objective is to drive as far as possible, cutting off the Allied armies in Belgium and possibly preventing the Dunkirk evacuation, thereby gaining a great victory for yourself.&#10;&#10;As your forces drive across the map, they will encounter various Allied Forces, represented by face down Fog of War and Allied Formation counters. When encountering an Allied Formation, play temporarily stops in order to resolve the Combat Sequence, with the game system generating forces that your own forces will have to defeat.&#10;&#10;",

If your cube is on the same side as an adjacent cube you get to play again.&#10;&#10;The difficulty of the game is  to keep track of the always changing cubes on the board.&#10;&#10;Solo play and 2 vs 2 play are also available in the base game.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

This makes for one of the most exciting and fast paced board games ever.  The new old game that combines philosophies from Pool, Pinball, Shuffle Board, Curling and Black Jack all mixed up with magnetic pull to create a fast moving new board game that is sure to provide many hours of enjoyment.&#10;&#10;The homemade and well crafted board includes a magnetized &quot;Shucker&quot; to propel the puck down the board and magnets placed throughout the board to deflect and alter the course of the puck.
