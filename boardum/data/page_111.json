    "description": "Three years after the collapse of South Vietnam, General William Westmoreland announced that &ldquo;militarily we were successful . . . we didn&rsquo;t lose a single battle above company level.&rdquo; It was in these intense company- and platoon-level firefights, which characterized most combat in the Vietnam War, that military engagements could be won and lost. At close quarters in the jungle, at night, and in hamlets surrounded by rice paddies, American soldiers faced their North Vietnamese and Vietcong enemies on even terms. FRONT TOWARD ENEMY allows players to explore intense company- and platoon-level battles from the perspective of a company commander, using a fast-playing system that provides the feel and unpredictability of small unit combat.&#10;&#10;FRONT TOWARD ENEMY is a simulation that recreates tactical engagements during the Vietnam War at the scale of 50 meters per hex and five minutes per turn. Units represent fire teams, heavy weapon sections, leaders, vehicles, and helicopters. Eight scenarios with set-up options recreate twelve missions that typified company-level engagements during the Vietnam War, including airmobile insertions, assaults on fortified positions, and classic search-and-destroy operations, among others.&#10;&#10;Rules cover all of the elements associated with combat in Vietnam: helicopter gunships, armored vehicles, artillery support, snipers, sappers, civilians, booby-traps, medics, evacuation of the wounded, prisoner interrogation, tunnels, hidden caches, and more. Winning doesn't always mean holding the objective if the cost in casualties is too great. Sudden combat in difficult terrain causes command and control to quickly break down. A chit-pull system means command and control is erratic, and volume of fire is rewarded, but results are fickle. The unforeseen occurs, ranging from non-combat injuries to interference from higher headquarters to so-called &ldquo;friendly fire&rdquo;. Immediate action drills, staying close, and the ability to move and act as a coordinated unit ensure survivability in this environment.&#10;&#10;FRONT TOWARD ENEMY puts you in the middle of the toughest fighting of the longest war of the 20th Century.&#10;&#10;FRONT TOWARD ENEMY contains:&#10;&#10;        three countersheets (5/8&quot;)&#10;        two unmounted mapsheets (22&quot; x 34&quot;)&#10;        one rulebook (20 pages, color)&#10;        two Combat Results Tables/Terrain Effects Charts (color)&#10;        one Helicopter Table (color)&#10;        four scenario cards (color)&#10;        two d10 &amp; one d6&#10;        one box &amp; lid&#10;&#10;&#10;FRONT TOWARD ENEMY scales:&#10;&#10;        each turn is approximately 5 minutes&#10;        each hex is approximately 50 meters across&#10;        counters represent Infantry Units of one to four men (Fire Teams, Weapons Teams, Leaders, and Individuals) Helicopters, and Vehicles&#10;        Additional markers represent Civilians, Caches (rice, medical, and ammo), Bunkers, Foxholes, and Tunnel entrances&#10;&#10;&#10;Designer: Joe Chacon&#10;Developer: Nick Richardson&#10;Map Art: Jordan Worley&#10;Counter Art: Nicol&aacute;s Eskubi&#10;&#10;(from MMP website)&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "A new miniature tabletop game.&#10;&#10;The website explains &quot;Wrath of Kings is a miniatures war game, where players take command of the armies of on of the five kingdoms of Arikania!  Scalable from 10 to 50 models per side, now you can vie for the throne of the Ancient King!&#10;&#10;&quot;With a unique one roll resolution system and an active chain of command, you'll feel like you're actually in charge of an army without being bogged down in tedious tracking.  Combat is fast, fluid, furious and tactical - your decisions will matter on the battlefield!&quot;&#10;&#10;There are five initial factions:&#10;&#10;House Teknes&#10;&#10;The armies of Teknes are some of the most well rounded troops. They are able to move from a defensive posture to attack in the blink of an eye. Both the Union Workers and Defender Linemen punish their enemies for attacking them. Their specialists and characters often employ lightning and magical wards to bolster their own defensive lines. No army attacks Teknes battle lines without expecting heavy casualties.&#10;&#10;House Shael Han&#10;&#10;The Shael Han fighting style is a mystery to all of their enemies and for good reason. The Legionaries are some of the weakest troops on the field by themselves, however whenever they are close by a specialist they become a force to reckon with. The Wrath led by their Big Sister are experts in engaging more than one enemy at a time. The true strength of any Shael Han army are their specialists, vulnerable by themselves but extremely powerful when working together they can cause a symphony of destruction on any battlefield.&#10;&#10;House Nasier&#10;&#10;Nasier love nothing more than to see their enemies wither in their path. The Nasier Ashmen charge is legendary and few enemies have ever lived to tell the tale. They&rsquo;re often supported by the Pelagarth who revel in combat and despite their lack of armor, cause more casualties then they take. The specialists of Nasier prefer to use flames to punish their enemies. One of the most aggressive armies, their zeal for reinstating the Efrenti presence leads them to wrought destruction throughout the continent.&#10;&#10;House Hadross&#10;&#10;As the most defensive army in the game, Hadross units become stronger both offensively and defensively as the game progresses. With each Deepmen lost, enemy models receive Resonate markers, which makes them easier to kill. Meanwhile the slower yet deadlier Sevridan keep enemy units from fleeing the battlefield. The Hadross specialists enhance the battlefield adding water elements to increase movement.&#10;&#10;House Goritsi&#10;&#10;Combining the fastest movement in the game with some of the strongest attacks Goritsi prefer hit and run tactics to conventional warfare. Players can employ the blazing speed of the Skorza to flank their enemies while their lethal Zeti hold the line. The terrible Blood Engine consumes the flesh of his enemies to heal his wounds. If you prefer high mobility armies and attacking first, Goritsi is the army for you.&#10;&#10;The models are in plastic, with weapons in polystyrene so that they keep nice straight edges on spear shafts, handles, and large sword blades etc.&#10;&#10;",

The game allows players to simulate the last German attempt to take Amiens, as part of the Michael Offensive. This bitter battle takes its place in history above all because it saw the first tank action between the two belligerents. However this historical detail should not obscure all other facts which mark out this battle, where successive attacks and counter-attacks succeeded each other: massive commitment of German tanks A7V, employment in the two camps of elite troops, attack at night,...&#10;&#10;April 1918 - The German Michael offensive, launched in Picardy, is peaking. Reaching the gates of Amiens, the Kaiser's troops threaten to definitively breakthrough the Allied Lines.&#10;On 24 April, the Germans captured the last defensive bastion in front of Amiens, the village of Villers-Bretonneux, during a battle that featured the first engagement between tanks. But that same night, Australian soldiers entered the line and prepared to repulse the enemy in an intense night attack.

You have seen an opportunity to make your fame and fortune as the town is built.&#10;&#10;In Builders of Blankenburg you are competing to construct the town and earn the most prestige while doing so. Each player takes on a persona which provides a unique benefit during the game. You begin the game with some basic resources and a small amount of silver. While all structures can earn you prestige, only building what the town's citizens demand will earn you the silver necessary to bid for and purchase more resources. Each turn consists of four phases:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Bidding (the primary means of gaining resources)&#10;    Building (constructing and occasionally demolishing)&#10;    Income (gaining silver for the structures you own)&#10;    Marketplace (an opportunity to buy plans and resources)&#10;&#10;&#10;The game introduces the citizen track, a growing group of town folk that allows all players to see which structures will earn them income. It also serves to signal the end of the game once the town is full. The town is split into four districts, each limited in size and awarding bonuses at the end of the game for anyone who controls more of a district than their opponents. If there are no other plots on which to build, the game also ends. Beware, while the citizens are known, the best laid plans can be ruined by events and visitors to the town. The player with the greatest prestige at the end of the game is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Time to catch some crabs! Not for dinner, mind you, but to sell to markets for a grand haul. In order to make the most for your efforts, you want to concentrate on those crabs grouped together in large sets. Otherwise you're piddling away time spent chasing individual crabs, which is hardly worth the bother. The fishermen who nets the most valuable haul wins the game.&#10;&#10;Set-up in Kraby differs depending on the number of players, with 80 or 120 tiles in play, the game board being 9x9 or 11x11, and the number of colored crab figures being 10, 12 or 15. Each player starts by secretly drawing six crab tiles (which come in four colors with two players and five colors otherwise) and placing them behind their screen. On a turn, a player chooses one tile and enters it from any side of the game board, sliding it in the row or column until it hits the island at the center of the board or another tile in play. (A move that would slide a tile off the board or create an impossible-to-fill space is illegal.) The player then draws a new tile and places it behind his screen.&#10;&#10;A player then has the option of placing one of the colored crab figures in his ship's hold. Each ship has three holds, with a scoring multiplier of x1, x2 or x3. A player can claim a color only once and cannot place it on the same multipler as another player. In a four-player game, a player can claim only two figures.)&#10;&#10;The game ends once the final tile has been placed and the game board filled. Each group of crabs in the same color, with orthogonally adjacent crabs belonging to the same group, is worth -1 to 5 points depending on its size. Once the value of a color is determined, each player scoring this color multiplies this value &ndash; which might be negative &ndash; by the multipliers showing on his ship's hold. The player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Captains of the Golden Age is set in a fictional East-Indies, in the golden age of trading and piracy, a time when pepper was worth more than gold!&#10;&#10;&#10;Four brightly coloured ships of different shapes and sizes lie anchored at Smuggler&rsquo;s Cove.&#10;&#10;Their sails are lowered and their crews are resting while they gently rock back and forth on the waves. An albatross circles the shipwreck that lies broken on the shore. The sun is setting and a warm light starts to shine from inside the gaping ship; it&rsquo;s the Smuggler&rsquo;s Cove inn.&#10;&#10;Four Captains sit at a round table at the center of the inn; some of the other guests are staring at the brightly coloured clothes they are wearing. A parrot closely watches the whole scene from a chandelier above the table. The colourful captains don&rsquo;t seem to mind; they talk, rest, laugh and enjoy their beers.&#10;&#10;Suddenly a small boy runs in, holding a sealed letter for the innkeeper. After reading the letter, the innkeeper glances at the other guests before walking over to the four captains. In a low whisper he says &ldquo;Friends, my contact from the Republic tells me that the price of pepper has just surpassed the price of gold&rdquo;, and turns back to his bar.&#10;&#10;The mood changes as a storm on a summer day and the captains reach for their weapons as if struck by lightning. Cautiously, they slowly stand up and back off from the table, but as their greed gets the better of them, they start running to their brightly coloured ships&hellip;&#10;&#10;&#10;Players start the game on smuggler's cove as one of these brightly coloured captains. Each captain owns a small ship with a tiny crew, one cannon and an empty cargo hold. Over the course of the game, each captain gathers resources to upgrade their ship at the shipyards of the Orient and the Republic or trades its cargo for valuable pepper in the Orient to get shares in the Trading Company and ensure their victory.&#10;&#10;The amount of sails determines how far you move per turn. Crew is used for boarding other ships and plundering cargo. Cannons deal damage to other ships and the size of your cargo hold determines how much cargo you can load and carry.&#10;&#10;Each player holds a hidden hand of cards from his own deck that can be used as temporary buffs to sail further, carry more cargo, or change the tide of battle.&#10;&#10;Besides all this players can hire the notorious pirate at Smugglers Cove, to secretly ambush other captains.&#10;&#10;&#10;CotGA has 0% randomness, all skill. Its main mechanics are pick-up and deliver combined with hand-management and bluff. Players choose the length of the game by the size of their starter ships.&#10;&#10;Trade cargo to upgrade your sails, crew, cannons or cargo holds. Attack other captains and board their ships to plunder cargo. Hire the notorious pirate to ambush competitors. Whatever your strategy, always keep one eye on the captain with pepper in his cargo hold.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "10,000 years in the future, humanity has claimed the stars. But all is not well. The Emperor is weak, and without strong guidance, the Empire is crumbling. Powerful guilds within the empire are squabbling, positioning themselves for their own gain. If the Empire is to survive, it needs a strong leader - that means you! You must build a power base throughout the Empire by connecting with important guilds: the military, traders, priests, engineers, expansionists, and politicians and then claim the throne. Time is running out, though; others also struggle for the throne. You must form a network of support with powerful guilds and slander your opponents. Each connection gains the support of some guilds, and at the end of the game the player with the most support grasps the Galactic Throne. Take advantage of events that occur for further gain. Be careful, though, because each slander you receive reduces your support.&#10;&#10;The name &quot;Carpe Astra&quot; was chosen after Jackson Pope asked the users of BGG to brainstorm a name for the game.&#10;&#10;",

Players hold a hand of ingredients of different types and colors and attempt to match all ingredient types or colors in the cauldron.&#10;&#10;Each turn, players ask a question about other players&rsquo; hands, referring to the ingredient type or color (but not both). (For example, &ldquo;Who has blue ingredients?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Who has newt saliva?&rdquo;) They then play a card from their hand into the cauldron and draw back up to three cards, ending their turn.&#10;&#10;Some ingredient cards have Binx the cat or a spell book on them. When an ingredient with Binx is played into the cauldron, the active player puts the Binx mover in front of any player. That player then lays their cards down so everyone can see them and keeps them there until Binx is moved. If a spell book is played, the active player draws a card from the Spell deck and resolves the card. Spells generally do something to ruin players&rsquo; plans.&#10;&#10;If you have cards showing all of one color or all of one object in the cauldron, then you've stunned one of the witches &mdash; and you need to stun the witches three times before time runs out! When stunned, a witch cannot cast spells from the deck.&#10;&#10;Players also have four &ldquo;Tricks&rdquo; to use based on scenes from the movie; each Trick can be used once per game. For example, &quot;Burning Rain of Death&quot; allows you to discard three potion ingredients and draw three new potion ingredients.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Welcome to the world of Mr. Bartholomew Grumpy, the most prolific producer in Hollywood. In Movie Empire, you are a junior producer working for that guy and are competing with other players to be the heir to his throne. You do this by producing movies (a few big blockbusters or several small trash movies) and publish them at the right time in the right market and hit trends to get awards. But also keep an eye on pleasing your boss as this will have an influence on your assets.&#10;&#10;Movie Empire is a mix of worker placement and set collection for 1-4 players. And as Hollywood is a shark tank, you have the (completely optional!) black dossier variant, that adds a take that mechanism to the gameplay. Let the clubbing and stabbing commence!&#10;&#10;The game consists of four phases: Grumpy phase, working phase, premiere phase and upkeep phase.&#10;&#10;The most important phase is the working phase. This is where you send out your production assistants (a.k.a. workers) in order to get production assets, cast stars, buy scripts or do some other tasks. But since many tasks can only be occupied by one player, you have to choose your strategy carefully. The gathered resources have to be attached to a movie. Pay attention to special laying rules and requirements - for example, post-production has to happen after shooting the movie and not before.&#10;&#10;Then if you feel like it, prepare for releasing your movie. Choose a market (each one with its own advantage) and reap your rewards. If you release the right movie at the right time, get ready for an award. But don't forget your boss, Mr. Grumpy. The more he likes you, the more possibilities you have. The sympathy value defines your budget every round and can open a second production line for you.&#10;&#10;So, who's gonna be the best producer in town?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

You'll do this by collecting sets of cards with matching location icons. Each time you collect a set of 3 cards that all have the same icon, you get to place a tag on a hex with that icon anywhere on the map.&#10;&#10;The game is played over 3 rounds and there are no turns! Once a round has started everyone takes their actions at the same time in any order they choose. There are 5 main actions:&#10;- Draw a card: Draw the top card from any draw pile into your hand.&#10;- Add to a set: Play a card from your hand or from the top of the share pile onto a set pile on your crew mat.&#10;- Share a card: Play a card from your hand onto a share pile that is empty or has the matching color or icon on top.&#10;- Complete a set: Clear a set of 3 cards from your crew mat and place a tag on a matching map hex.&#10;- Rush a set: Take a cop car token to clear an incomplete set and place a tag on a matching map hex.&#10;&#10;The end of the round is triggered either when all draw piles are empty or once only 1 player has tags remaining on their map. Each player gets 6 crew tags from the supply and another round commences. The game ends after 3 rounds and you'll score for objectives and for each map hex where you have a tag AND lose points for cop cars and solo tags. The crew with the most points wins!&#10;&#10;",

The opponent takes one of those cards and places it on their side of the board, adding to their power in that category; the other card is added to the score for that category at the end of the game. Players alternate turns until all of the cards have been distributed, then players see who has the most strength in each category. The winner of a category wins all the points in that category, and whoever collects the most points wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "From the publisher's website:&#10;&#10;The Second World War saw naval warfare evolve from the clash of mighty dreadnoughts, which had been the preoccupation of navies for half a century, to a conflict dominated by the aircraft carrier and submarine.&#10;&#10;The Battle of the Atlantic saw German U-boats attempt to strangle the economy of the United Kingdom, with fast commerce raiders such as the pocket battleships and the mighty Bismarck attempting to slip into the Atlantic to wreak devastation upon the allied convoys.&#10;&#10;In the Mediterranean the Italian and British fleets squared off as each side attempted to settle the fate of Egypt and North Africa, as both sides attempted to strangle the other&rsquo;s supply routes.&#10;&#10;In the east mighty carrier fleets clashed as the Imperial Japanese Navy tried to hold on to the rapid conquests of 1942, whilst all the while American submariners strove to paralyze Japan&rsquo;s industrial might via attacks on her merchant fleet. It was here that mighty battleships clashed in ferocious night battles amongst the Pacific islands.&#10;&#10;Victory at Sea brings these conflicts to life allowing budding admirals to re-fight the epic battles of this conflict, or to create their own fleets based upon the ships of the day and fight entire campaigns. Over seventy different ship classes are detailed, allowing a wide array of different battles to be fought with eighteen scenarios included.&#10;&#10;Based upon the award winning A Call to Arms games system, Victory at Sea is a fast flowing game that will allow novices and veteran gamers alike to enjoy recreating the epic struggles between the mighty fleets of the era.&#10;&#10;Victory at Sea includes counters to use with every class of ship featured in the game.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Order of Battle: A Supplement for Victory at Sea&#10;&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Victory at Sea: Age of Dreadnoughts&#10;&#10;&#10;",

In the event of another tie, discard all four cards and start another turn by refilling the display to three cards.&#10;&#10;After playing eight turns, whoever has the most plant cards in their garden scores a point chip, then everyone takes their bidding cards back in hand and starts a new turn.

    "description": "Dead of Night is a 1 to 6 player game based on scenarios you might recognize from various zombie films. There is no 'Zombie Master' here: all the players are on the same side, all working together to survive, although the option to use other players as zombie bait while you grab all the guns and lock yourself in the cellar is there if you prefer.&#10;Either way, you will need to use strategy and your (fresh and spicy) brains as well as chainsaws and shotguns to make it through the night.&#10;&#10;Each scenario has a location to be explored, and an objective to be fulfilled, but if things don't go well just survival may be enough. Cards drawn throughout the game may help or hinder your progress, but as the night draws on you can be sure things are going to get much worse before you see the sun again.&#10;&#10;The game ends when somebody fulfils the main objective (eg, escaping in a fuelled up vehicle), or at daybreak, which brings respite in the form of an advancing army patrol. If you can survive until the end of the game, you are a winner. The survivor who best fulfils their objectives will come out on top.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Mall of the Dead&#10;&#10;&#10;",

On a turn, a player rolls a color die, picks up the cardboard &quot;plank&quot; of that color, places a wooden &quot;stone&quot; some distance away from where their rabbit is located, then tries to place the plank so that their rabbit will be able to move onto the stone. If the player succeeds, the rabbit moves; if they misjudged where to place the stone, the rabbit stays where it is.&#10;&#10;By repeating this process, the rabbits move down the &quot;stream&quot; to where the carrots are located, with the first player to reach a carrot winning the game.

A captain has 3 action points per turn, which can be used to choose the actions mentioned above.&#10;&#10;The homeless polar bears stand on ices, waiting the captain&rsquo;s rescue.

After the Nazi occupation of Warsaw, the university was closed and the professor lost his job. He came up with the idea to sell the game to financially support his family. In occupied Warsaw, &quot;Hodowla zwierz&#196;&#133;tek&quot; (&quot;Little animal farm&quot;) &ndash; as the game was then known &ndash; became extremely popular. After the end of the war, the game was forgotten and it reappeared on store shelves only in the 1990s through Granna.&#10;&#10;Rancho, designed by Michael Stajszczak, was made to honor the memory of Karol Borsuk and to commemorate the success of &quot;Hodowla zwierz&#196;&#133;tek&quot;, a.k.a. Super Farmer. Rancho expands the possibilities which Karol Borsuk's original game presented to players as now farmers must not only exchange their animals well and breed them, but also plan purchases of pastures on which to graze their herds.&#10; In more detail, you breed animals in order to have the best ranch in the region. You buy pastures so that your animals will have a place to live. Your animals breed and this brings you profit. You can convert animals to other types of animals if you decide it's worth it, or you can buy more pastures to have space for more animals. To win, you must be the first to collect a herd consisting of at least a horse, a cow, a sheep, and a rabbit. But all your plans can go awry if you are not careful because in the nearby forest there are prowling predators, specifically a wolf and a fox. Your animals can easily become their prey...&#10;&#10;Reimplements&#10;&#10;&#10;     Super Farmer&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Except for the near disaster on Omaha Beach, the landings go well.&#10;&#10;Both sides begin the race to build up, and the Allies, with total command of the seas and skies, begin to pull ahead of the Germans as the month of June wears on.

The British Second Army, scheduled to take Caen on D-Day, is held up short of that objective with heavy losses for the entire month by fanatical and skillful German resistance. The Americans face weaker opposition, and despite taking the port of Cherbourg, they become bogged down in the endless maze of hedgerows.&#10;&#10;Can the Germans buy enough time to form more reserves and stave off disaster? Can the Allies break the stalemate earlier than they actually did and perhaps win the war sooner? Play June 6th and find out for yourself.&#10;&#10;",

When paintings are drawn from the stack, a value card is clipped to them in this fashion.  Players move around the board by die roll and land on spaces that allow the player to collect money from the bank, receive a painting from the stack, sell a painting to the bank for its value, sell a painting to the bank for a specified amount, auction one of their paintings to the highest bidding opponent, or auction the top painting in the stack to the highest bidder.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the painting stack is exhausted.

This is the award-winning Operational Combat Series monster game DAK in a tighter, faster-playing SCS format.&#10;&#10;North Africa trims one map that extended into Egypt from the original DAK format and cuts numerous unit counters and markers not needed in the SCS format.  The game uses a unique activation system tied to Supply Units, which must be saved up to create large-scale offensives.  Supply is scarce enough to make tracking easy and naturally is central to this critically important aspect of North African warfare.&#10;&#10;The game utilizes Leaders, Forts, Mines, Random Events, Capture Awards, Withdrawals to Far Away Lands, and The Greek Campaign. It also includes a nifty little optional Operations rule that allows players to tie their moves into a larger plan of their own making, thus giving more context to what they are doing than is normally the case.&#10;&#10;Each hex represents 5 miles (8 km) and a Turn is one month. &#10;An Activation represents 1-2 days of intense combat operations. &#10;Units range in size from Companies through Divisions.&#10;&#10;North Africa Scenarios:&#10;&#10;     Operation Brevity, 1 map, 1 turn&#10;     Operation Battleaxe, 2 maps, 1 turn&#10;     Operation Crusader, 2 maps, 2 turns&#10;     Gazala, 2 maps, 2 turns&#10;     First El Alamein, 1 map, 1 turn&#10;     Operation Compass Campaign Start, 4 maps, 24 turns&#10;     The Race to the Wire Campaign Start, 4 maps, 20 turns&#10;     Operation Crusader Campaign Start, 4 maps, 21 turns&#10;     Battle of Gazala Campaign Start, 4 maps, 7 turns&#10;     First El Alamein Campaign Start, 4 maps, 5 turns&#10;&#10;&#10;Note: All four maps together measure 86x34 total setup space.&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;&#10;      SCS Series rulebook (version 1.8)&#10;      North Africa Game Specific rulebook&#10;      North Africa Scenario Booklet&#10;      Four 22&rdquo; x 34&rdquo; full-color maps&#10;      560 Counters&#10;      Box and Dice&#10;&#10;&#10;(from MMP's website and North Africa Rulebook)&#10;&#10;",

The Turks stop a premature Russian offensive and then launch a disastrous counter invasion.

The Indian colonial government lobbies to push further into Mesopotamia, with Baghdad as the objective.

In these games players take on the role of an investor, trading stocks and shares in train companies in order to beat the competition and earn the most money. Rollway Station distils the experience into a short solo experience, using dice to add a layer of unpredictability.&#10;&#10;The game is played over fifteen turns, in which the player will roll five dice and assign them to three different actions: buying shares, auctioning trains, and laying track. The values of the dice determine the options a player has. Every few turns there is an operating round where the companies run the best routes they can and earn money for the player based on the number of stops they make and the number of shares the player owns. The player also has access to Engineers who will help to lay additional track at the cost of money. The aim of the game is to earn the most money possible.&#10;&#10;There are three different maps available with different starting layouts and special advanced rules. There is also a multiplayer variant in which all players play the standard solo game but using the same dice rolls, comparing their score at the end.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The village elders prohibited venturing out into the dark starless night for fear of the dangers that lurked there.

Draw constellations into the earth, with your depictions gaining light, stars, and stardust for the village.

Upgrade your ship, manage your crew, and engage in deep tactical combat. Keep your ship intact and adapt as the situation escalates to emerge victorious!&#10;&#10;Solar Titans uses a unique blend of deck-building and tableau-building mechanics to offer fast-paced and strategic gameplay. You build a capital ship by placing down and connecting ship cards that represent your command deck, core systems, plating, and weapons. Your layout decisions determines the relative strong and weak points of the ship. As you play, you use crew cards from your hand to operate the ship and acquire new ship parts and crew from a market. When you are ready, fire your ship weapons at your opponent's ship. Take down their command deck to win!&#10;&#10;Each turn allows you to make important decisions. In combat, you decide on the sequence of weapons to fire and what to target. Ship weapons differ in their attack strength, direction of attack, and special effects. Disabling the right ship modules on the opponent's ship can make all the difference. When buying from the market, you decide on whether to improve your economy, defense, offense, or utility. The market offers many powerful weapons, advanced plating, and specialized crew. You also have the opportunity to modify or perform repairs on your ship each turn - but keep in mind that your supply of field repairs are limited!&#10;&#10;Solar Titans is designed to be easy to learn, but with gameplay that is tense and engaging. You and your opponent's capital ships will accumulate damage over time, forcing new strategies and priorities. The randomized market and gradual arrival of new ship components will also shift the dynamics of combat. You must balance between short-term gains and long-term plays, knowing that each ship may only be a few turns away from being disabled. Do you reinforce your command deck or your crew quarters? Do you fire your weapons now, or prep for a large volley? Do you take down the opponent's missiles or heavy cannon? The opportunity for almost infinite ship layout variations, the randomized market, and changing combat dynamics ensures that this game offers replayability and a sense of mastery over time.&#10;&#10;Solar Titans suits 1 to 4 players and offers 6 distinct game modes: The classic capital ship dual (1v1), free-for-all (3-4 players), hunter killer showdown (2v2), titan ship dual (2v2), titan ambush (1v2), and a solo and 2-player co-op mode against a powerful automata ship with 3 boss variants and randomized AI bonuses.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Maybe the planes they build aren&rsquo;t always the prettiest (or even symmetrical).  That&rsquo;s O.K.  Master Pennington doesn&rsquo;t mind.&#10;&#10;Object of the Game:&#10;Players earn crowns, the native currency of Crumplehorn, primarily by selling planes.  Better planes sell for more crowns.  But what really makes a factory succeed is its workers.  Hiring employees for your factory will cost you crowns, but they're also a great investment.  Employees can speed the production of planes, help you find better parts, sabotage your opponents&rsquo; factories, or receive crowns from the bank.  At the end of the game, the player with the most crowns wins.&#10;&#10;Each player&rsquo;s turn consists of 4 phases: &#10;  Hire: Spend your crowns to hire new employees to work in your factory.&#10;  Acquire: Gather new parts cards from one of the parts depots.&#10;  Flyer: Play your parts cards into your factory to build your flyer.&#10;  Buyer: Sell your plane to the buyer, Master Pennington.&#10;&#10;",

On a turn, you choose a player that has a token in front of them, take that token, then present them with a question by choosing one of the three question prompts (which are all color-coded), then choosing two cards from your hand and adding the properly-colored section of those cards to the question. A sample question: &quot;What would you miss more if it ceases to exist: Facebook or doors?&quot; That player secretly votes on A or B, while everyone else but the questioner secretly votes A or B depending on how they think the person will answer; a voter can optionally add their 3x scoring token to their vote.&#10;&#10;Once everyone votes, you reveal the tiles. Everyone who voted correctly moves ahead one or three spaces on the scoring track, and the questioner moves ahead one space for each person who voted incorrectly. If you pass a certain space on the scoring track, you retrieve your 3x token (if you've used it). Since you can ask a question only of those with a token in front of them, everyone is asked roughly the same number of questions, and whoever has the most points after a certain number of rounds wins.&#10;&#10;",

The bombs started falling on the third day, and by the 19th day ninety-nine percent of the earth&rsquo;s population was dead or would be soon. Wars and conflicts had raged now and again for decades prior, populations rising up, and the global government seeking to quell the conflict and maintain the status quo. But in the most recent five year period, the conflicts escalated rapidly, and the world order began to come apart&mdash;leaders became scared and trigger fingers twitchy. No one knows who pressed the button first, and in the harsh realities of the world that followed, no one cared. What mattered was surviving and, if possible, rebuilding.&#10;&#10;Each turn, players will draft and simultaneously play a card from their hand (&quot;pack&quot;) to indicate their action for the turn. This may be moving citizens or airships to explore or expand around the modular board, building structures, researching technology, initiating conflict, producing or gathering resources, and abating radiation. All of these things can earn you points in different ways. If you cannot store resources, they are left on the ground and are available for anyone present to use. Each card has an action and a lesser version of another action, so you're never stuck being entirely unable to do a particular thing, and you can also store cards for future.&#10;&#10;Once all actions are complete, hands are passed to the next player and a new card is added to each one. If a &quot;Winter&quot; card is added, it is discarded and replaced, and the game timer advances. As the game timer advances, both expected events (spread of radiation, combat, feeding your citizens) and unexpected events may occur. When the Winter track reaches the end, the game is over, and points are scored.&#10;&#10;",

Flipping a spent card face down gives it new value as 1 point. This mechanic lets you find creative uses for your resources, giving all cards relative value.

During the magic phase, players take turns trying to harm opponents with nasty magic tricks or enhance their own character's abilities. Movement takes place on a game board divided into three continents, and the two inner continents can be moved via magic stones to hinder an opponent's movement or allow a player access to blocked areas. During the journey, players need to combat opposing figures, destroy monsters, find treasures that might boost character abilities, and gain or invade resource pools to fuel a player's economy.&#10;&#10;Realm of Wonder mixes area control, dice rolling, and bluffing. The game is beautifully drawn with a set of miniature figures for each character. Random elements can be minimized with an alternative rule set that makes this a great game for both younger people above 9 and hardcore gamers alike.

    "description": "Turin Market is an auction set collection game for 2-5 players, takes 10-30 minutes to play, and utilizes bluffing, silent auctions, sales, and loans. It is incredibly quick and easy to pick up, but has a deep breadth of strategy driven by player interaction and perceptive card value.&#10;&#10;There are 18 goods cards in the game, each with 3 of one good, 2 of another, and 1 of another. The goal of the game is to have the most Scudo (aka money) when the game ends. Each round all players will put one card from their hand in the center, and reveal them simultaneously. Then all players will participate in a Silent Auction, with the highest bidder receiving the most cards and so on down the chain. All players who received any cards pay their bid to the bank, and anyone who did not receive a card (lowest bidders) will pay half their bid rounded down. Everyone will then have the option to put a card they have won up for sale using their own Scudo as collateral for the sale price.&#10;&#10;There are slight variations based on the number of players, such as keeping a secret card in your hand until game end to add to your goods. In the 2-4 player games there are 5 auction rounds, after which a payout phase begins. Players with the most of each good are paid an amount from bank, as well as 1 Scudo from each other player with any of the good. Once payout is complete, everyone pays back their loans (taken out for 10 and paid back for 15) and the game is over. The player with the most Scudo is declared the winner!&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "A Spoiled Victory: Dunkirk 1940 is a solitaire game on the Allied rescue operation from May 27 to June 4th of 1940. Approximately 400,000 men from the Allied forces of Belgium, France, and England were surrounded in the area of Dunkirk by German forces. England launched Operation Dynamo with the hopes of rescuing 30,000. Instead they rescued 330,000. In this game, the player controls the Allied forces and must try to recreate the historical result.&#10;&#10;The game uses Event cards to define the conditions for each turn. These cards dictate where the Luftwaffe will strike, how many units can evacuate, the German army movement, and the number of player actions.&#10;&#10;The game uses a point-to-point map. The Allies can move between any two connected points but the Germans can only move on set tracks. As the player moves the Allied forces to the beach, they are converted to evacuee units, which can then sail to England. But even then they can be subject to artillery or Luftwaffe strikes until they arrive safely in England.&#10;&#10;The game is scored by calculating the total number of evacuees rescued and earning victory points as a result. The historical result or better wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "A new pathology has just appeared! Patient Zero has been identified, and it's up to you to find the antidote as soon as possible to save the patient and humanity!&#10;&#10;Save Patient Zero pits two labs against each other. Each lab employs one or two scientists (i.e., players), while another player plays a lab computer named Savvy. The labs compete to identify an antidote of three molecules, with the labs typically sharing no information with one another; whichever lab finds the antidote first wins.&#10;&#10;The general idea of the game is to use lab tools in the best sequence possible to identify the three molecules out of 25 that make up the antidote. (These 25 molecules are arranged in a 5x5 grid on each lab's worksheet.) At the start of the game, Savvy looks at the top three molecule cards in that deck, then sets them aside. These are the molecules the labs must identify. On a turn, each lab submits a tool card to Savvy to show what they want to do in the round, and whichever lab submits first takes its action first in that round. Actions include:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Samply: Draw three sample cards from your lab's deck, and give them to Savvy. Each sample card depicts five molecules, and Savvy will identify which of them show at least one molecule used in the antidote.&#10;    Mikroskopo: Choose two cards from your lab's deck, and give them to Savvy, who will treat them like the cards in &quot;Samply&quot;.&#10;    Dedukto: Receive five molecule cards from Savvy. You (but not the other lab) now know these molecules are not in the antidote.&#10;    Centrofugo: Place your centrifuge on your lab worksheet so that it points to four molecules. Savvy then indicates whether any of these molecules are in the antidote.&#10;    Scanpad: Place a cardboard device on your worksheet to highlight six molecules in a 2x3 grid. Savvy then indicates how many molecules highlighted (0-3) are part of the antidote.&#10;    Spionado: Savvy takes two lab cards from the opposing lab that do not have any molecules in the antidote on them, then shows them to you.&#10;    Antidote: Circle three molecules on your worksheet. If all three are in the antidote, you win! If not, Savvy will indicate how many of the circled molecules are in the antidote.&#10;&#10;&#10;Each lab has a limited number of actions in its deck &mdash; eighteen total, with three Samply, two Dedukto, one Scanpad, two Antidote, etc. &mdash; so use them wisely, especially the Antidote because if you fail to identify the correct three molecules a second time, then your lab loses the game automatically.&#10;&#10;To play Save Patient Zero as a two-player game, each lab draws three molecule cards from the deck, and the opposing lab must identify these three molecules before you can identify the three molecules they drew. Each lab takes the role of Savvy for the opposing lab.&#10;&#10;",

Schnupperspiel is a small, promotional copy of 6 nimmt! containing 24 cards and playable for 2 to 4 players.&#10;&#10;The game plays very similar to 6 nimmt! except that the cards here are numbered 1 through 24. With 2 players, each player will be dealt a hand of 10 cards, but for 3 or 4 players, each player starts with 7 or 5 cards, respectively. 3 of the remaining cards form the rows where players will play their cards. Players simultaneously select a card to play and will add their cards to the rows in ascending order. If a player selects a card that is so low it cannot be added to any series, that player takes a row of cards and the low card begins a new row. Each row can contain at most 5 cards. The player that places the 6th card must take the other cards in the row and the 6th card is used to start a new row.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to have the lowest score at the end of 4 rounds. Rounds end after all cards have been played. Players score points for each ox head present on the cards they collect.&#10;&#10;",

Each player takes a turn moving the single pawn around the board. Once you land on a space, another player draws a card (each with 6 categories on them), looks up your die roll on that card and reads the corresponding category. If you landed on a 15 or 30 you have that many seconds to think of as many words in that category as you can and for each word you can come up with, you cover the appropriate space on your plastic board with a chip. The aim is to be first to fill all 25.&#10;&#10;If you land on a hand, you get 15 seconds and choose another player. For every word you think of you can pull a chip off of their board that starts with the appropriate letter. If you land on the 2 space you can cover 2 spaces on your board for free (handy for Q and X, Y, Z).&#10;&#10;The timer is obnoxiously loud by intent (very distracting) and flips over very suddenly, scaring people who aren't used to it, to mark the end of the time limit.&#10;&#10;Basically, this is a very simple word enumerating party style game that's quick and easy to learn and frustrating for people with poor vocabularies or stalled minds.&#10;&#10;Many years ago, while still known as Nelospelit, Tactic already used the title Ord Mani for an earlier word game; these are different games, although some similarities do exist.&#10;&#10;",
