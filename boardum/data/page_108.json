    "description": "French Wars of Religion - Volume 1&#10;Dreux 1562, La Roche l&rsquo;Abeille 1569, Coutras 1587&#10;&#10;- Dreux 1562&#10;As the first pitched battle of the French Wars of Religion, Dreux began with an enthusiastic charge by Coligny&rsquo;s cavalry. All the Royalist infantry, except the Swiss, was put in disorder. The attacks and counter-attacks would continue until Guise and Saint-Andr&eacute;&rsquo;s troops, passive until that point, overwhelmed the Huguenots. At the end of the day, almost all the commanders of the two camps were killed or taken prisoner. Despite the Protestant rout, the war would continue for a long time !&#10;&#10;- La Roche l&rsquo;Abeille 1569&#10;After the assassination of the Prince of Cond&eacute; at Jarnac during the third French War of Religion, Coligny regrouped the Protestant forces near the Vienne. He managed to surprise the Duke of Anjou, who had set off in pursuit of him, despite his strong defensive position. At dawn, Coligny&rsquo;s avant-garde progressed through hedges and thickets. The Royalist infantry, knocked about by the Protestant cavaliers, was beaten and their commander, Filippo Strozzi, taken prisoner. This victory would be a limited and fleeting one.&#10;&#10;- Coutras 1587&#10;The eighth and final French War of Religion began with Henri of Navarre's first battle as commander in chief. Faced with the Royalist troops commanded by the Duke of Joyeuse, &ldquo;Premier mignon du Roy&rdquo;, Navarre took advantage of the night to position his troops near Coutras. At ten o&rsquo;clock, the charge of the Royalist gendarmes hit the first line of Huguenot cavalry despite the deadly fire of the artillery commanded by Sully. But the counter-charge of Navarre, Cond&eacute; and Soissons shifted the course of the battle and destroyed the morale of Joyeuse&rsquo;s troops. The ensuing massacre caused the deaths of Joyeuse, his brother, and numerous other noblemen.&#10;&#10;See Avec Infini Regret wiki&#10;&#10;",

Each player's cards and shuffled to form a deck, and this deck is used for each of the game's three rounds.&#10;&#10;In each round, team members take turns trying to get their teammates to guess as many words and phrases on the cards as possible in 30 seconds. In round 1, almost any kind of clue is allowed, and the cluegiver cannot pass on a card. In round 2, no more than one word can be used in each clue (but unlimited sounds and gestures are permitted); the cluegiver can pass on any card he likes, and the teammates can give only a single answer. In round 3, the cluegiver can use no words at all and can pass as often as he likes; again, teammates are allowed only a single guess. Give good physical clues in round 1, and they'll pay dividends down the road when you need to keep your mouth shut and gesture like a maniac before time's up!&#10;&#10;Time's Up! Family 2 has 440 new words.&#10;&#10;",

The next player can pass (in which case they're out for the remainder of the round) or they can play one or two cards that rank higher than what was played; if they do, they take the previously played card(s) in hand. Each subsequent player can either pass or play a higher set of cards of cards, but a set that includes at most one card more than what was played most recently. Once all players pass, the cards in the center are removed from play, and whoever played most recently leads in the new round.&#10;&#10;When a player runs out of cards, the round ends and players score points for the cards they've collected.

Each trick, players either play from their hand, play a sandbag (to sluff, that is avoid winning the trick), or play one of their opponents' face-up cards. During the round, it's possible for the trump to change as the number and kind of face-up cards are exchanged for face-down sandbags. Five rocket cards worth negative points are in play each round, and you want to win these while avoiding the sandbag cards because in the end the player with the lowest score wins.&#10;&#10;Sandbag is a highly interactive trick-taking game for 3-6 players that excels at higher player counts!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Even the First Sovereignty, which scattered humanity to a million worlds, has collapsed, consigned to oblivion. No one remembers what brought it about, whether a withering apathy, rebellions across its repressed worlds, or the impenetrable whims of the enigmatic, inhuman Xeno. Yet humanity is tenacious. There are always more fledgling civilizations ready to rise to the heights of power and culture, invent new technologies, and usher in a new millennium.&#10;&#10;Deep Future is a card-driven board game for 1-3 players of empire and innovation spanning the rise and fall of the countless worlds of the galaxy. You will settle on planets, expand your influence across sectors, invent new technologies and rediscover old ones, and face challenges that threaten to tear your civilization apart as you try to achieve one of several paths to victory.&#10;&#10;Deep Future is a &ldquo;Make-as-You-Play&rdquo; game, which means that the game starts with a few materials (a map, paper, index cards, and colored cubes) and the remaining components will be generated as needed during play. Each game will see the addition of new cards, which represent the worlds in the galaxy, the techs invented, and the lasting impact of previous civilizations.&#10;&#10;The rules include tables and guidelines for creating new cards as needed, and this makes every copy of Deep Future an evolving galaxy. In addition, it means that each game inherits all components added or changed in the previous games. The galaxy&rsquo;s content &mdash; its worlds, techs, and history &mdash; can grow endlessly over a connected campaign as players return to see what each new era holds for the future of humanity.&#10;&#10;",

Recreates the events of those days and allows the players to reproduce the most famous battles of the Blitzkrieg on the East Front at a tactical level. Players take command of either the Allied or Axis forces (or can play solitaire) in the tactical battles of each scenario.&#10;&#10;PTH while utilizing &quot;La Bataille de France, 1940&quot; base rules, incorporates new and adapted rules and additions for this new front. The WSS promises many hours of fierce fighting between the infantry, tanks, artillery and aircraft belonging to the armies enveloped in this conflict. Just a few of the additions include:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Human wave attacks&#10;    Battalion officers&#10;    Communist Commissars&#10;    Recon rules&#10;    Flamethrower tanks&#10;    Motorcycle recon&#10;    Waffen SS&#10;    Rumnanian&#10;    Gully&#10;    Rail Roads&#10;    One 8'5 x 11&quot; chart with many overlays&#10;&#10;&#10;PTH has a moderate complexity with good solitaire suitability. The system emphasizes the role of officers. Officers can activate units, coordinate with other officers and their units, call for artillery support, air support, smoke screens, influence moral checks, coordinate assaults, and much more. Rules for special actions.&#10;&#10;Based on the principle of simultaneous execution, or simply &quot;WE GO&quot;, a hybrid system of turns and &quot;real time&quot;. The players must activate unit leaders to perform many actions (fire, assault, move, coordinate, etc). A turn ends when both players have completed all their activations. The scale is platoon level with units &#10;representing groups of between 30 and 40 soldiers, weapons units represents groups of 3-4 weapons and their accompanying crews (20-25 soldiers), and the AFVs/Transports representing groups of 3 to 5 vehicles and their corresponding crews. Scenarios are divided into turns representing about 12-15 minutes of action.&#10;&#10;Turns are divided into the following phases: Command Phase, Initiative Phase, Activation Phase and Marker Removal Phase&#10;&#10;The game uses isomorphic mapboards, each of which can align to any edge of equal length on any other mapboard. This allows for an almost unlimited number of combinations to create any terrain situation, including player designed scenarios.

    "description": "Hof Gap - The Nurnberg Pincer  is one of several games in the Central Front Series published by SPI in the 1980s. Both the game and series depict the early days of World War III in West Germany. Combat is conducted at the company, battalion, and regiment level, with a map scale of 4 km per hex. The map covers the Hof Gap and includes the major West German city of Nurnberg.&#10;&#10;The Central Front series use a collection of mechanics, including &quot;Operations Points&quot; and &quot;Friction Points&quot;, variable length game turns, and Zones of Control to simulate modern battlefield conditions. As with most modern warfare games, the series includes rules for airpower, air-mobile operations, and nuclear/chemical warfare.&#10;&#10;The game contains three scenarios. &quot;Covering Force&quot; covers the first 36 hours of combat in the Coburg, Kronach, Hof and Cheb Gaps, and is played on the eastern half of the Hof Gap game-map. &quot;VII Corps&quot; uses the entire game-map, treating the Meiningen approach as well as the action shown in &quot;Covering Force&quot; for the first four of the next war. &quot;Seventh Army&quot; allows the player to join the Hof Gap game-map with the Fifth Corps: The Soviet Breakthrough at Fulda game-map and other components of the &quot;Fifth Corps&quot; game in order to represent the entire US front in central West Germany&#10;&#10;",

Each scenario is played on a single sheet map with scenario-specific rules that allow players to face some of the unique challenges and struggles of that particular battle.&#10;&#10;In each scenario the player takes the role of one of the powers from the Second World War, trying to achieve historic goals. Each scenario focuses on different aspects of conflict, such as supply, artillery support, and fighting withdrawals. Scenarios take place across a wide range of theaters, from Western Europe to the Eastern Front, North Africa, and the Pacific.&#10;&#10;The games are played over a series of six turns, and while each game features unique choices, the player is often forced to make difficult decisions on whether to attack or defend, how best to bolster their main forces with support such as reinforcements and artillery, and when to advance or withdraw from conflict.&#10;&#10;Players need only print a single sheet of paper, grab a handful of dice, and can play right away. Each game takes only a few minutes to set up and learn the rules and can be played in 10 minutes or less.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

You are one of these paratroopers. And as luck turns out, the winds have blown you directly where you are needed the most!

The Germans believed they could launch an offensive on both sides of Reims, which would pinch out an Allied salient and draw in Allied reserves, and thus possibly produce a breakout across the Marne leading to the final drive to Paris. Despite gaining their bridgehead across the Marne, the Germans did not expect the fierce resistance offered by the Allies including the American 3rd infantry division-which earned its honorific name &ldquo;Rock of the Marne&rdquo; for its steadfast defense.&#10;&#10;An even bigger surprise awaited the Germans, however, when the Allies attacked them with crushing power from a wholly unforeseen direction three days later. Refusing at first to relinquish the initiative, the Germans showed why they were masters of defensive warfare in World War 1 as they exacted a fearsome toll in casualties from the attackers including the American 1st and 2nd infantry divisions.&#10;&#10;Rock of the Marne shares many of its design features with MMP&rsquo;s earlier game on the 1918 battles - Operation Michael. The Germans&rsquo; striking power consists of the battle-depleted, but still dangerous, stosstruppen. Trained specifically in infiltration tactics, these hard-core infantry units can find a way to pick apart the toughest Allied defensive position. The Germans also have mobile, and deadly, machine-gun units that will wreak havoc on unwary attacking Allied units. The Allies used tanks in record numbers in their initial assault, and these are shown in the game, as well as the six big American divisions that participated including the famous 1st Infantry Div, The Big Red One, the 42nd Infantry Div, the Rainbow Division, as well at the 3rd.&#10;&#10;The air game has been significantly expanded in Rock of Marne as both sides deploy their air assets to bomb bridges, and strafe infantry. Finally, both the Allied and the German player must learn to operate within their constraints and opportunities of the WWI command and control environment, which means you may not automatically get to attack with all the units you had planned!&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;&#10;    One 22&quot;x34&quot; map&#10;    280 counters (1 countersheet)&#10;    Series Rules&#10;    Rock of the Marne Specific Rules&#10;    Two Dice&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Part of the Standard Combat Series.&#10;&#10;",

Ships move on the surface, although freighters move more slowly.&#10;&#10;The submarine gives away its position when it fires a torpedo, but beware! You will have to choose as an ally whether you prefer your freighters to dodge it or move your destroyer to the area where the torpedo came from and sink your opponent.&#10;&#10;SCOPE U-boot has many game modes, with different levels of game complexity and duration.&#10;&#10;Select the scenario, create the card grid and jump right into the action!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

It all starts with a pallet and multiple boxes of different shapes that you need to stack on top of it.&#10;&#10;The game is cooperative, with players teaming up to pack the most compact pallet possible. You draw cards that indicate the color or shape of a box, and that's the type of box you have to stack next. The game proceeds until there are no more boxes to stack or until the players decide it is best to stop to avoid penalties. Scoring takes into account three factors: the number of full rows on the pallet, the number of boxes that aren't stacked on the pallet at the end, and the number of penalty points (from cards you draw but cannot play). The best score is 25. The perfect solution exists, but will your team find it?&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Alien City is a game that is set in the far future and concerns the building of a city on a newly colonized world. Society in this distant time is divided into four powerful guilds. These are the Energy Guild (symbolized by a red sun), the Synthesis Guild (symbolized by a blue fountain), the Control Guild (the most powerful guild of all, symbolized by a green crown), and the Builder's Guild (symbolized by a black tool---yes, that's how tools look in the far future).&#10;&#10;Cities in this future contain two types of structures, towers and domes. Towers are owned by the various guilds. These are the power plants (energy), factories (synthesis), and government facilities (control). Domes are smaller structures used to house the citizens. As with the towers, domes are always associated with a particular guild. Both towers and domes are color-coded to identify guild affiliation; red for energy, blue for synthesis, green for control, and black for builders.&#10;&#10;Each of the guilds wants its towers positioned close to the towers and domes of other guilds (their customers) and far away from its own other towers (to avoid competing with other towers of their own guild). Location, location, location! Some things never change, even in the distant future.&#10;&#10;The Builder's Guild is unique because there are no Builder's Guild towers, i.e., no black towers. Instead, the Builders are compensated for their efforts by being given the profits of some of the other guilds&rsquo; towers that the Builders choose as they construct the city.&#10;&#10;The players in this game are competing builders working to construct the city. At the same time, they are choosing towers for themselves that they hope will be profitable with many close customers and little competition. The choices must be made with care because each builder may only choose three.&#10;&#10;Red, blue, and green large Icehouse Pieces are used for the towers, and piecepack coins with the suit side up represent red, blue, green, and black domes. The land area of the city is defined by a 4x5 array of piecepack tiles, suit side up, with each tile representing four building sites. The game-play consists of the players alternating turns, placing a tower or dome each turn until either all&#10;available towers and domes have been placed or until there are no legal construction sites remaining within the city. Then scores are determined based upon the relative positions of the towers and domes.&#10;&#10;Winner of the piecepack Ludic Synergy design contest.&#10;&#10;Online Play&#10;&#10;&#10;    Abstract Play&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "By November of 1796, Napoleon Bonaparte was eight months into a brilliant campaign in northern Italy which was removing any Austrian threats to the French Republic's southern flank. The fighting that month, north of the besieged city of Mantua, proved to be one of the first great challenges in the young General Bonaparte's career. Two Austrian forces under Marshal Alvinczy and Lt. General Davidovitch threatened to converge on the French from the north and east, join together at Verona, and march southwards to raise the siege. Bonaparte's task was to make use of his interior lines around Verona to unite his scattered and out-numbered troops, and defeat the separate wings of the Austrian &quot;pincers&quot; in detail.&#10;&#10;BATTLE for ITALY is Avalon Hill's new strategy game for two players which recreates the critlcal period of November. 1796. During a typical game turn, both players attempt to move their brigades by normal and forced marches. Combat occurs when opposing forces move adjacent to each other. and is resolved by a die roll on the Combat Results Table. Important leaders on both sides are represented in play, and their Individual attributes are critical to each players success. Game victory depends on how well the Austrians do in defeating the French and exiting units off of the map to break the siege.&#10;&#10;BATTLE for ITALY contains a colorful map of northern Italy around Verona, 100 playing pieces, and a short rules booklet.&#10;&#10;Playing Time: 1 1/2 hours&#10;&#10;Complexity Rating: 4&#10;&#10;(from 1-10, 10 the highest)&#10;&#10;source: back of the box&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Following their victory at Pearl Harbor, the Imperial Japanese Navy's First Air Fleet moved through the American, Dutch and British colonies of South and East Asia. Having taken the mighty British naval base at Singapore, the next move was to enter the Indian Ocean and challenge the Royal Navy there.&#10;&#10;Eastern Fleet' is a complete game in the Second World War at Sea series covering these campaigns. Scenarios range from the Japanese invasions of Burma and the Andaman Islands through the massive carrier raids to the planned but never executed invasion of Ceylon. The Japanese often have overwhelming superiority in the air, which the British must counter with guile while trying to lure the enemy into range of his slow but powerful battleships.&#10;&#10;Pieces represent the ships and aircraft that took part in the campaign. The Japanese fleet is built around its five powerful fleet carriers with their deckloads of Zero fighters, Val dive bombers and Kate torpedo bombers, all wielded by expert pilots and crews. They are supported by four fast battle cruisers, fast but lightly protected heavy cruisers and big destroyers armed with the awesome Long Lance torpedo.&#10;&#10;The Royal Navy is outnumbered and outgunned in the air, with three fleet carriers &mdash; all of them smaller than their Japanese counterparts &mdash; and one nearly useless light carrier. The British do have four old and painfully slow R-class battleships and the much more useful Warspite, newly rebuilt in an American shipyard. British cruisers are vastly inferior to those of the Japanese in both numbers and capability, as is the case with the British, Australian and Dutch destroyers.&#10;&#10;But this is the Royal Navy, with a tradition of victory and a secret base on which it can fall back in the middle of the supposedly empty Indian Ocean. The British cannot be counted out until their last warship is sunk.&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;&#10;    Strategic Map&#10;    Tactical Map&#10;    210 counters&#10;    2 Airbase Cards&#10;    2 Task Force Cards&#10;    2 Player Aid Cards&#10;    24 page Series Rulebook&#10;    20 page Scenario/rulebook with 11 Scenarios&#10;&#10;&#10;(from publisher's website and user's decription)&#10;&#10;",

Facing a coalition between Prussia under Blucher and Russia under Sacken, Napoleon caught them and was about to crush them in decisive battles before Paris in 6 days of February, 1814.&#10;&#10;Designed by Hall of Fame Napoleonic game designer Kevin Zucker, developed by Paul Dangel, the game comes with a standard 22&quot; x 34&quot; map by Rick Barber showing mud and snowy ground at 1,700 yards per hex, 280 counters, mostly division size units. One 24-pages rulebook with 6-pages of historical commentary by the designer and 1-page of Terrain Effects Chart included (hence the rules actually occupy only 17 pages).&#10;&#10;The Six Days of Glory is an operational Napoleonic game. 3 short scenarios are included, covering the campaigns in three separate battles at three cities along the road to Paris: Champaubert (9~10 Feb); Montmirail (11~12 Feb) and Vauchamps (13~14 Feb), each playable in less than 1 &frac12; hours. A campaign scenario linking all three (9~14 Feb) battles from the beginning to the end can be completed in less than 3 hours.&#10;&#10;The French moves first in all scenarios. The game has a standard command check &ndash; move &ndash; combat sequence with an additional night turn on each turn during which armies can force march to out maneuver the enemy. Features include Chain-of-Command and Leadership Initiative, Artillery Bombardment, Supply and demoralization, Repulse at odds greater than 5-to-1, Movement across Pontoon Trains and Bridges (Allied only), and an interesting weather effect of forced mud on wheeled unit during the afternoon (PM) turn. Team play is also possible where Allied command is divided between Prussian and Russian and thus communication between the two is not allowed unless written messages are exchanged.&#10;&#10;GAME SYSTEM: DAYS System = 1,600m/hex, 800-1,000 men/SP, 6 hours/turn.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Senet is an ancient Egyptian board game similar to backgammon.  Each player has 5 pawns which travel around a 3 by 10 board in an S shaped path.  Movement is dictated by the throw of 4 sticks (black on one side and white on the other) which can produce a 1,2,3,4, or 6, (5 is not possible) depending on how they land..  As in backgammon, the objective is to bear all of one's pawns off first.  A couple of interesting differences is that there are safe and trap spaces on the board.  Also, players may block each others' progress as in Parchisi.  Senet sets are usually constructed from various woods and are often quite beautiful.  Senet is one of the oldest boardgames but unfortunately it fell out of use for a few thousand years and no ancient rules set has been discovered.  Undoubtably another tragic loss resulting from the Library of Alexandria burning to the ground.  As a result scholars has made several educated guesses as to the rules.  The most popular versions are in the files section.&#10;&#10;It may be a relative of Aseb and The Royal Game of Ur.&#10;&#10;",

But one of the die rolls will cause everyone to pass their potato-counting papers to the left, making the pencil-marker start where their neighbor left off, and giving someone else a big head start.

To do this, they must master &ldquo;K&egrave;&rsquo;s&rdquo; &ndash; small portions of day-time necessary for their concentration.&#10;&#10;Each player will embody one of these mages. They will need to carefully select and cast their spells in order to accumulate as much knowledge as possible before the end of the tournament to be declared the most powerful mage. Who knows, maybe even before it has even started !&#10;&#10;Very similar to handling &ldquo;Mana&rdquo; in other games, you start with 4 active K&egrave; that you will replenish by playing special concentration cards. With special cards called Timers you will prepare powerful combinations by keeping a card aside to be used on your next round to beat your opponents.&#10;&#10;Time Masters &ndash; Highlights :&#10;&#10;     Deck building style offering a large freedom to the player to build his combos&#10;     Victory points are on the playing cards and are not bought separately (like in Dominion)&#10;     Cards which are &ldquo;bought&rdquo; during a player&rsquo;s turn go straight to their hand and not their discard pile; these cards can be played directly on the next turn.&#10;     More than 30% of spell cards drive interactions between players&#10;     Resource management; your mana (Ke&rsquo;s) is handled on the table independently from your spells thus not polluting your hand.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "From the great trading center of Damascus, via the Silk Road, ancient weaving techniques and motifs made their way to the famous textile houses of Venice. Master weavers used draw looms to create richly woven fabrics that became known as damasks. For centuries, these luxurious silks lavished the wardrobes and halls of mansions and palaces across Europe.&#10;&#10;In Damask, players play the roles of these master weavers, trying to make the most money, while also gaining the favor of the Weavers' Guild. In more detail, the game includes 72 damask cards, with the damasks being two of six colors and one of four patterns; place 26 cubes (which come in six colors) at random on the spinning wheel, lay out a pattern and color card at random for each &quot;season&quot; that the game will be played (two in a short game, three in a normal one), then lay out six damask cards at random. Each player drafts a damask card, then you refill the display.&#10;&#10;On a turn, either you take a damask card and place it in front of you, or you draft cubes from the spinning wheel by choosing a cube, then going clockwise or counter-clockwise until you hit the second cube of any color. Collect all of those cubes, placing them on damask cards as you wish and keeping the remainder in your overstock. Each damask card requires three cubes of one color and two of another to complete. After the required action, you can take one of two optional actions: Take all cubes of one color from an opponent's overstock (with them receiving a guild favor in compensation), or mount a damask by returning the five cubes on it and standing it in your personal holder. You earn 1 coin when mounting a damask and 1 additional coin for each color or pattern it has that matches the previous damask you mounted, i.e., at most 4 coins.&#10;&#10;If a mounted damask also matches the season's color or pattern, you gain guild favors. Each guild favor has a color or pattern on it, and you can use them to mount damasks in place of missing cubes, replace damask cards available in the display, mount an additional damask, or avoid paying taxes for extraneous cubes left in your supply at the end of a season. Three guild favors are worth 1 coin at game's end, and in addition to coins earned during the game, you receive bonus coins at game's end for having all six colors or all four patterns among your mounted damasks. Whoever earns the most coins wins.&#10;&#10;",

After her revolt succeeded in burning three major towns and slaughtering tens of thousands of Roman citizens and allies, the Emperor Nero seriously considered whether this distant land was worth the cost to stay. Governor G.S. Paulinus&rsquo; remarkable victory (perhaps at the location later known as &ldquo;Watling Street&rdquo;) reaffirmed Roman domination. They would remain in Britain for over 300 more years.&#10;&#10;But it might have been different. Can you as the leader of a various cluster of independent Celtic tribes cause enough trouble and loss to make the Romans leave your island? Can you as the commander of scattered Roman troops snuff out the rebellion more effectively than Paulinus? Will London burn or be saved?&#10;&#10;Boudicca: The Warrior Queen represents a full upgrade of the Druid: Boudicca's Rebellion, 61 A.D. game Richard H. Berg designed for West End Games over 25 years ago. Along with great counters and map art (including the period road net and location of tribal centers), you&rsquo;ll find streamlined mechanics, more involved possibilities and &ldquo;what ifs?&rdquo; - and a game driven by card play, somewhat like that used for Hammer of the Scots.&#10;&#10;",

Achieving an ambition allows the player to convert that adventurer's &quot;will&quot; into points and to possibly level him up. All ambitions require the player to venture forth, which means moving his party from one site to another along a path. One of the main actions in the game is playing an enemy or adventurer card to these path spaces. Once a path is completely filled in, any player can choose to venture forth down it and encounter each card one by one, recruiting adventurers, defeating enemies, and possibly gaining treasure along the way.

    "description": "The definitive version of a Michael Schacht classic, Patrician: Towers of Influence features an updated presentation, new two-player rules, and two expansion modules.&#10;&#10;Welcome to 13th Century Italy, a time when wealthy Patrician families build magnificent towers to represent their power and prosperity: the more influential the family, the taller the tower!  You are a master builder, ready to profit from the vanity of the Patrician families.  You take building orders, adding floor after floor, and when a tower is complete, you&rsquo;ll be there to take the credit.  At the end of the game, the builder with the most victory points wins!&#10;&#10;Patrician: Towers of Influence is delightfully effortless to play.  Each turn, play a Building card, which allows you to add to a tower in the matching city.  Some cards allow you to take special actions that help you or hinder others. Next, take the face-up card from the pile next to the city where you just built a tower.  As the game goes on, players will continue to build up the various towers, and points are scored for who controls the tallest towers in each city, as well as for playing Patrician portrait card sets. In the end, the builder with the most points wins!&#10;&#10;This new version of the classic game includes several expanded ways to enjoy the game.  When playing with two players, you compete against the Architetto, a wily bot opponent who thwarts your plans.  The Trade Routes and Delegates modules can optionally be added in to increase the decisions and affect final scoring.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "&quot;War is merely the continuation of policy by other means.&quot; &mdash;Carl von Clausewitz, On War, published 1832&#10;&#10;Your goal in The March of Progress is to control countries through the playing of action cards so that you generate victory points (VPs) during scoring. Whoever has the most VPs at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;In the game, each side has a hand of eight action cards, ranging from Move to Attack to Recruit. Each player simultaneously chooses one card to play each turn, then reveals and carries out the action. Cards stay discarded until a player plays their score card after which they regain all played cards.&#10;&#10;The March of Progress includes an introductory scenario based on The Thirty Years War to set out the core rules of the game. The game includes four additional historical scenarios: The Age of Marlborough, Vive l&rsquo;Empereur, World War 1 in the West, and World War 2 in the West. Each scenario changes the set-up and tweaks the rules to give a flavor of strategy in different time periods. The scenarios create a varied and challenging two-player game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Each game includes battles that have their own custom game boards, plastic figures representing the infantry, artillery, and cavalry with counters representing the special units, leaders, etc. Each battle within the game is playable in 1 to 2 hours. The game uses the Hold the Line command action point (CAP) system. Also added is a new optional chit pull system that is ideal for solitaire play. The game highlights the strengths and weaknesses of the different nationalities and units, as well as the various formations of each. The second game in the series is Napoleon's War Volume II: The Gates of Moscow with custom game boards of Marengo, Austerlitz, Aspern-Essling, and Borodino.&#10;&#10;Plastic pieces in blue, white, and green portray the French, Austrian, and Russian armies.&#10; This game is a sequel to Napoleon's War:  The 100 Days&#10;&#10;",

The higher the card played, the more likely one is to move up, but there are other interesting plays such as grappling onto another balloon, using soporific gas on lower balloons or storms which defeat the leaders. It can be especially interesting to compete against the non-player Black Baron who has been known to win the game from time to time, even playing randomly.&#10;&#10;",

The railroads are the place to do it, and the American Southwest is booming, with robber barons starting and funding railroads across Texas and beyond. Savvy investments will pay off handsomely, others not so much. What sort of dividends should be paid versus how much should be kept by the railroad for further expansion? Each railroad president must decide for themselves, keeping the shareholders happy or being forced out in a hostile takeover.&#10;&#10;In the luck-free game Southern Pacific, six railroads vie for dominance in Texas as they approach from Louisiana, Arkansas, and Oklahoma in the 1800s. The selling of shares finances these railroads, with the president of each railroad auctioning stock, building new track, acquiring existing track from other companies, or paying dividends. &quot;Bull market&quot; auctions at the end of each round can unexpectedly disrupt a president's control of a company. The game ends when one railroad has built all of its track or all stocks have been acquired. A stock earns dividends during the game, but has no value in the final scoring. In the end, whoever has the most cash in hand wins.&#10;&#10;",

Players then put in turn a card on the table, *trying* to put theirs in chronological order. A player may, instead of adding a card, claim that the order in which the cards were put is incorrect. In this case all cards are turned over and the correct years revealed.&#10;If the order was correct then the doubting player receives two cards and skips a turn. If the order was incorrect then the previous player, who accepted the order as correct, receives three cards. The first player that gets rid of all the cards wins.&#10;&#10;Bluffing is as least as important as knowledge in this game. Most events are rather obscure or are hard to date exactly, so this ain&rsquo;t no game for the nerds/geeks of this world, even they might think so, because it&rsquo;s full of surprises and pure fun. Highly Recommended, because Anno Domini is a blast to play, is a very enjoyable social event and you even learn something from it.&#10;&#10;Unfortunately there is no English edition in existence, but this game could be a good way, to improve your already existing German skills or a very good reason, to learn the German language in the first place.&#10;&#10;The Set &quot;Anno Domini - Sport&quot; contains historical events related to the world of sports, can be played as a stand alone or together with the other sets, which is the best way of playing it.&#10;&#10;Part of the Anno Domini series&#10;&#10;",

Once the auction is done, players can use their cards' special abilities to expand their empire and thus score points. Beware however of other players, as they can steal some of your cards, or destroy parts of your empire. The game calls for cunning placement of your cards in your empire and shrewd bidding in the auction phase. The game ands after three full rounds, or after a player manages to build his/her 16th city (card) in his/her empire.

All residents of Draghan, be it skin or scale-covered, celebrate this anniversary with a race. Organised by the folk but run by the old dragons. The race is to a chest full of treasure, the very same chest that was offered at the truce to buy the dragon's favour. In the true spirit of the days gone by, the dragons now pit their wits against each other instead of the Draghanian folk...and today it seems you are a dragon...so you better be prepared!&#10;&#10;Sneaky Ol' Dragons is a racing game full of surprises. A round starts with drafting the cards you are going to play that round. From the cards drafted you always play 2 cards on yourself and one card on each other player. So make sure when you draft you don't keep only good cards or you'll also help your opponents.&#10;&#10;When all cards are assigned the cards will be executed one by one and the dragons will move on the racing track. Most cards just make your dragon go forward, but there are also many action cards available that influence the race.&#10;&#10;Will you find a knight on your way? Only if you have enough courage left you will be able to beat him and continue your way. If you don't have the courage you'll have to run backward.&#10;Just maybe your dragon will stop to smell a flower and blow himself backward when he sneezes (dragon have hay fever!) while the other dragons in front of you jump forward to avoid burnt bottoms.&#10;Or will you encounter a novice wizard. You really can't predict what will happen when he fires off a spell with his wand and you are accidently in his way.&#10;And the race will have quite a lot of additional surprises waiting for you to discover.&#10;&#10;The game also includes some variations.&#10;For example you can choose to hold the race in the enchanted forest on a &quot;safe&quot; forest path. Or you can hold the race in the mountains where you have to make sure you avoid the rockslides and jump over the dangerous holes.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Choices made, victories and defeats, and buildings and blocks damaged and destroyed in combat will affect later missions and ensure that every campaign plays out differently.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "The June 6, 1944 Allied landings in France were an overwhelming success. With more men and material landing each day, the growing power of the American and British forces should have resulted in a drive inland -- but three weeks after the landings, the shallow beachhead had only expanded slightly. There was growing concern that the bloody fighting of the First World War might be repeated.&#10;&#10;British forces should have captured the city of Caen, just 15 kilometers from Gold Beach, on the first or second day of the invasion. British Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery, commanding 21st Army Group, faced great pressure to secure the city and tie down German mobile forces while the Americans captured the port of Cherbourg. But a direct attack on the city itself failed at the cost of many Canadian and British lives.&#10;&#10;Next the British attacked west of Caen, where a successful advance might outflank the city and force a German retreat: Operation EPSOM, an attempt to gain by maneuver what could not be taken by assault. British divisions, fresh to war but having trained for years, faced the feared SS troopers of four panzer divisions. Both would soon learn the harsh realities of war in the hedgerows and fields of Normandy.&#10;&#10;Although Montgomery in the end did not force the Germans to abandon Caen itself, he did draw the German armor onto the British Army, who both tied it up and ground it down. The whole purpose of sending I and II SS Panzer Corps to Normandy was to drive the Allies into the sea. Steady British efforts forced the commitment of the armored formations as they arrived on the field and so depleted them that no coordinated German offensive was ever launched.&#10;&#10;Beyond Normandy is a Panzer Grenadier game covering the British operations from the end of June to the middle of July and the German reactions to them. Three maps (two 22&quot; x 34&quot; and one 22&quot; x 17&quot;) depict the actual battlefield at 200 meters a hex and include individual bridges, villages, tracks, roads, hedgerows and church steeples.&#10;&#10;The 583 playing pieces represent leaders, infantry and tank platoons and artillery batteries. They include the weapons employed by British infantry and armored brigades and German SS and Wehrmacht panzer and infantry divisions. New British tank types include the Churchill, Cromwell and Firefly tanks, the flame-throwing Crocodile, and the bomb-throwing AVRE. The Germans bring tough SS grenadiers, Panther tanks and more.&#10;&#10;The game includes 39 scenarios and 5 &quot;super&quot; scenarios (combining two or more of the scenarios into a large-scale operational scenario).&#10;&#10;This game is part of the Panzer Grenadier series&#10;&#10;",

Somehow, I don't know how or why, but somehow we survived the onslaught. There were only a few of us, but we escaped the pit of hell that was the urban wasteland. They always say the suburbs have it better, right? They weren't hit nearly as hard; we've found a sturdy house. It still has a roof and everything. We're hungry, tired, and it's a struggle to hold back the dead from their nightly assaults, but we're still here, we're not going down yet.&quot;&#10;&#10;Zpocalypse 2: Defend The Burbs is a standalone tower defense-style game, evolved from the original Zpocalypse, a survival board game set in a post-apocalyptic wasteland.&#10;&#10;Like the original, two to five players each control their own squad of survivors equipped to the teeth with weapons, food, and items. In this game, your actions as squad leader allow the survivors to choose their tasks on the daily action board. Each choice has limited space and will come with benefits (potential for more supplies) and costs (like all things in the Zpocalypse, it's never pleasant!)&#10;&#10;With gained experience, your survivors level up on a variety skills. Rather than picking your path for you as in the original game, now you have the ability to carve out your survival scenario for yourself, but be careful what you wish for.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Designer James Ernest released The Big Idea through his own Cheapass Games in 2000, with the game being a hybrid of party game and light strategy game. In that design, players would create crazy inventions from the adjective and noun cards in their hands, simultaneously choose one invention (other than their own) to invest in, pay to invest in other inventions (whether newly created that round or an earlier creation), then roll a die for each investment to see whether it pays off and if so by how much. The player who collected the most money won.&#10;&#10;For the 2011 edition of The Big Idea from French publisher Funforge, Ernest and Funforge's Philippe Nouhra have transformed the design into a true party game by stripping out the elements related to earning money. Players still have a hand of adjective and noun cards, and combine any number of them to create a fancy invention. They then take turns pitching their ideas to everyone in the game, lobbying players as if they were in front of a crowd of venture capitalists. Players then secretly vote on which idea they feel should be rewarded, placing a reward card face down in front of the chosen invention and blank cards in front of all other inventions. The player who collects the most rewards wins the round.&#10;&#10;Unlike the Cheapass titles of yore, Funforge's The Big Idea will include high-quality, full-color illustrated cards packaged in a nice box.&#10;&#10;",

When a boat is full, it launches, carrying your voyagers to one of the islands in play, where your voyagers will start to perform the jobs to which they were assigned:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Explorers explore the island, scoring 1 point per round, and increasing an exploration bonus for the island.&#10;    Miners collect ore, which will score an end game bonus.&#10;    Colonists build farms worth a chunk of points. Having a majority of colonists also wins a player the exploration bonus for the island.&#10;    Captains can do any of the three jobs above.&#10;    Warriors must displace another voyager and take over their job, sending the displaced voyager back to the owner's pub to be reassigned next round.&#10;&#10;&#10;After six rounds of assigning voyagers and launching boats, the game ends, bonuses are tallied, and the player with the most points wins!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

This is called a Conclusion.&#10;&#10;You&rsquo;ll take turns placing your ideas onto the board, with the restriction that new tiles may only be placed in the center nine squares. Each tile has a space that it will target with a unique effect. If placed correctly, a player's tiles can push or pull the opposing player's tiles. Moved tiles may also push neighboring tiles or even enter into the target space of the current player's previously placed tiles, triggering chain reactions. Tiles that are eventually pushed off of the board are returned to the player that owns them. The game ends when a single player has reached a Conclusion: three of their tiles connected in a line, horizontally, vertically or diagonally.&#10;&#10;Philosophy often feels more like a puzzle than a competitive game, as the board state grows in complexity and changes between turns. The calm theme, simple mechanics, difficult decisions, and premium production come together in a high quality experience for avid gamers and casual players alike.&#10;&#10;",
