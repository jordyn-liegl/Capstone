    "description": "Even for the mightiest pirates there comes a time when they must retire from their lives of invading and plunder &mdash; but what's coming afterward? Well, on the five peninsulas of Grog Island, they can invest their loot in rock-solid businesses, such as peg-leg shops, carpentries for figureheads, workshops for voodoo dolls, or the infamous &quot;Grog Hole&quot; pub.&#10;&#10;The core of Grog Island is its unique auction mechanism, which uses five colored dice. The players use these dice and the pips on them to create and raise bids. While the winner of an auction can claim buildings on certain peninsulas, the players who have passed are also rewarded: Not only do they receive goods like grog bottles or treasure maps but they also visit merchant ships where they can trade these goods for money, parrots or treasure chests. The auction mechanism of Grog Island makes for tactical and interesting gameplay as in certain moments, passing can be almost as rewarding as winning an auction. Finding the right balance between bidding and backing out is the key to winning.&#10;&#10;The game ends as soon as one player has claimed a certain number of buildings, then all players score the secret goal cards they received both at the start of and during the game. These cards may give points for majorities on peninsulas as well as for claiming certain types of buildings or collecting certain goods. The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Focus (or Domination) is a Sid Sackson abstract strategy game in which players attempt to make moves and capture pieces in such a manner that their opponent(s) have no moves remaining.&#10;&#10;On a turn a player may move a piece or stack of pieces based on the number of pieces that comprise it as well as the number of pieces to be moved (e.g. 1-piece = 1 space, 3 piece stack = 3 spaces.)  When a stack grows over five pieces, pieces from the bottom of the stack are removed to bring the stack back down to five.  Pieces of a player's own color that are taken by that player are reserved to re-enter the game at a later time; pieces of the opponent's color are kept as captured.  Reserved pieces can be entered on a turn in any space on the board in place of making a move of pieces; strategic use of reserved pieces can make the game by utilizing them to capture stacks controlled by opponent(s).&#10;&#10;Sackson includes the game In his 1969 book, A Gamut of Games.  The book  makes a reference to the Whitman Publishing  Company production of 1965, along with reporting that the two-handed version was first described in the October 1963 issue of Scientific American Magazine.&#10;&#10;",

A battle so ferocious, that the villagers fearing for their lives, acquire the help of a powerful Wizard, who casts a spell over the Dragon Lords to keep them imprisoned in a circle of combat and to be freed only at the battle&rsquo;s end.

Lands and places have begun to disappear beneath the waves, and before long the rising tides will take us all. We must do something, or a watery grave will be the fate of everything to grace the land. At first we knew not of the cause of The Everrain, but it has since become painfully apparent that the Old Gods of the ocean have awoken, and they are angry. For too long the people and creatures of the earth have prospered, and the Old Gods have arisen to usher in a new age of the Sea. We must do something, before all is lost to the rising tides.

The ancient Old Ones of the sea have awoken and begun to reshape the world in their image, and unless something is done all will drown in the rising tides. Players must explore this dark and foreboding world, completing quests, expanding their crew, upgrading their ship and investigating the source of the Everrain before it is too late.&#10;&#10;Starting from humble beginnings, each player must traverse the seas of the Everrain to discover new places. The board is randomly generated from modular tiles, leading to a completely unique setup each time the game is played.&#10;&#10;Each player begins with their own ship and a skeleton crew, but more experienced crew can be found in the darkly lit taverns of port towns, saved from shipwrecks and even be rewarded for completing quests. The game is progressed by completing quests which can trigger important plot points, but players must be wary as the Old God&rsquo;s minions also seek to advance their own agendas. Combat can take place from ship to ship and even aboard a player&rsquo;s vessel, so each crew member must be ready for almost anything!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Fief is a game of strategic conquest and diplomacy that simulates a military, economic, and political fight between several lords in the Middle Ages &ndash; with players being those lords and representing noble families that want to have the most powerful kingdom in the land.&#10;&#10;Fief is played in a fictional kingdom in the Middle Ages, with the villages connected by roads and each village belonging to both a fief and a bishopric. Each player starts with a lord, a castle and some troops in one of the villages.&#10;&#10;At the end of each round, check to see whether one or more players have won, with shared wins being possible through alliances created by marriage. Winning solo is tough, so players need to negotiate, make deals and form alliances. To do this, players use their three embassy pawns; by spending a pawn, a player can have a three-minute-long private conversation with one or more other players to make whatever deals they wish. You have only three pawns, so plan well for these talks!&#10;&#10;Players draw cards each round: character cards that can bring new lords into play and event cards such as good harvests, good weather and taxes. They pay the costs to play cards, with some cards being playable at any time to upset current events with a surprise assassination or underground invasion. Players then receive income, with which they can buy troops and buildings, and move lords and troops among villages, with troops never being able to travel without a lord. If troops from more than one player end up in the same village, they battle until one side is eliminated or forced to flee.&#10;&#10;If a player controls all villages in a fief and has at least one castle there, he can purchase the title of the fief and assign it to a lord, with the title being passed to an heir if the lord subsequently dies. Players also try to secure the titles of king and pope, which provide benefits of their own, as well as points. Each title of fief, king or pope is worth a point, and the first player to collect three points wins. Two players win if they are allied and have a total of four points.&#10;&#10;The 2011 version of Fief has vastly revised rules with new materials and set-ups for shorter game play in addition to the long game.&#10;&#10;Reimplements:&#10;&#10;    Fief&#10;    Fief 2&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Game play in Heul doch! Mau Mau is simple, but it may bring you to tears all the same when you give points away to other players.&#10;&#10;The game consists of 98 cards, with 1-7 each appearing twice in seven colors. Each player starts with a random card face up in front of them as a personal discard pile as well as a hand of four cards. On a turn, you must play one card from your hand following the familiar game play rules of matching the color or number. Ideally you want to play on your own pile, but if the card you would play matches the top card of your left- or right-hand neighbor's discard pile, then you must play it there instead!&#10;&#10;Maybe you can choose a card in hand that matches only your top card? If you have no valid play or don't want to give points away to someone else, you can play the card face down on your stack, showing the weepy onion on the card back. On your next turn, you can play any card you like on your pile &mdash; except if it matches a neighbor's top card, of course, in which case you must give it away. (You can't play on a neighbor's onion card.)&#10;&#10;Once all the cards have been played, everyone scores for the cards in their pile &mdash; but first they must count the number of onion cards in their pile. However many onions they have, they must remove all matching number cards prior to scoring. If you have four onions, for example, you must discard all 4s &mdash; and this is bad since all cards score points equal to their value. If you have ten onions, then you first discard all 7s, then all 3s. Whoever has the most points wins!&#10;&#10;Heul doch! Mau Mau includes twelve special action cards that can be used to twist up game play when played instead of a number card:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Catapult: All players with the highest number on their pile discard those cards to the center of the table.&#10;    Beach towel: Exchange your top card (whether onion or number) with the top card of another player's pile.&#10;    Merry-go-round: Decide whether all players pass their topmost card to the player on their left or right.&#10;    Werewolf: All players must flip their top card from number to onion or vice versa.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

But beware &ndash; the Amazonas is not for the timid! Fearsome crocodiles lurk in the tepid waters of the rivers, and hungry jaguars stalk the twilight paths. Do not shy from such dangers too long, for the cost to build a new outpost increases the longer it takes you to reach each new village. Your funds are very limited, so speed is essential. Your sponsor has also sent you a secret directive. You must fulfill the demands of this special mission, or you will lose much of your newly earned fame!

Can your guild sweep through its districts and gain power through recruiting influential citizens and acquiring valuable relics?&#10;&#10;The revised edition of Arcana is a card game of recruitment and resource gathering for 2-4 crafty leaders. Command a guild of loyal agents during a series of district encounters against your opponents. Score the most prominent citizens, advantageous locations, and valuable treasures through bribery and power struggles. Collect the highest amount of victory points to become the master guild of Cadwallon!&#10;&#10;This vibrant game creates a fantastical atmosphere for players to enjoy while they attempt to best their opponents through strategic card play. Make your guild the most influential by winning Stake cards and strengthening your deck with impressive Personalities, advantageous Locations, or tempting Relics to use in bribery.&#10;&#10;The revised edition of Arcana introduces two new guilds to choose from, the Guild of Fortune-tellers and the Guild of Architects, as well a variety of optional rules that players can utilize to enhance their experience. Players can customize their guild, fulfill objectives, recruit Militia, invoke the ability of their Guild Masters, affect game play through random events, or optimize tactical strategy through card discards. Which variant will you use in your game?&#10;&#10;Summary of Play&#10;&#10;Arcana is played over a series of rounds that are comprised of two phases, the Intrigue phase and the Resolution phase. Send Agents from your unique guild deck to any of Cadwallon&rsquo;s districts to claim control of Stake cards: Personalities, Locations, and Relics, all of which award victory points.&#10;&#10;During these district encounters players gain control of Stake cards by playing their Agent cards. Stake cards are won through meeting or exceeding the card&rsquo;s main arcanum: either Military, Political, Spiritual, or Financial. Whichever Agent has the highest matching arcanum type wins the current revealed Stake card in that district.&#10;&#10;Of course if the Stake card you are after is a Personality card you can choose to bribe them with a Relic Card instead, immediately ending the phase and wresting the victory points from your opponents should you succeed.&#10;&#10;Players can increase the mystery of the final outcome through bluffing. Players control two friendly distracts (piles of Stake cards) in which they can place their Agents facedown. Will your opponent chance opposing you when he is uncertain of your arcanum value?&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Rod Hockey is a relatively inexpensive representation of the dome-style hockey games found in many arcade halls.&#10;&#10;Using steel rods, plastic or metal hockey players slide along defined track segments.  There are five players and one goalie per side, just like real hockey.  Players simultaneously turn and move their five metal rods to shoot the puck and pass.  Games can be played using a timer or to a set number of points.&#10;&#10;Many different versions of this game have been published over the last 50+ years.&#10;&#10;Steel rods with metal gears were used before plastic ones, the plastic gear system was quickly abandoned as gears would not last. From there a curved spring was used (ImageID: 427829) from rod to player holding slider. This worked well for durability. This changed the game though considerably, as there was a bit of spring action in shooting. Slap shots were less powerful, but wrist shots worked better. Many different ice layouts were made for rod and player movement within the defined track segments. Swiveled tracks made players look like they were skating down the ice. This changed play and tactics for each game, it was considered having home ice advantage, as you were used to your game surface design. You knew how the puck bounced off the boards and where to exploit the best scoring chances. Various pucks were used, heavier ones worked better with the gear system, lighter ones worked better with the spring system. The puck with the steel ball in center moved the fastest and was most popular for the avid player.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "People Power: Insurgency in the Philippines, 1983-1986 is volume XI of the highly-praised and popular COIN Series originally designed by Volko Ruhnke. This is one of only two games in the COIN series that feature three separate factions, instead of the customary four.&#10;&#10;The first faction is the Government, symbolized by the personal rule of Ferdinand Marcos, his wife Imelda, and his political cronies and military forces. Second are the Insurgents represented by the New People&rsquo;s Army (or NPA). The NPA sought a national uprising from both the urban and rural populace. Finally, the third faction are the non-violent Reformers, embodied by Aquino&rsquo;s widow, Corazon. She, along with her allies and supporters in that moment of tragedy, revived a platform of social justice and unrelenting momentum that would irrevocably change the Philippine political landscape immeasurably.&#10;&#10;For players new to the COIN Series, or for those looking to teach the the series to their friends, People Power will serve as an excellent introductory game. It was designed for simplicity and quick play, utilizing many of the basic COIN Series mechanics. The 22&quot; x 17&quot; map aids in introducing the game to a new player, as it presents only two types of terrain - Cities and Countrysides (where the latter amalgamates the rural settings of the island nation as well as much lightly-habitable terrain of jungles and mountains). Don't let the fast play and basic systems fool you, though. There are still plenty of strategic puzzles and inter-player backstabbing to be had! Also, People Power includes a new feature for the COIN Series - a Key Personality mini-hand procedure that represents the effectiveness of various generals and power brokers adding a new dimension to player actions and decisions.&#10;&#10;",

There are also hill cards which have each two quarters of an island with a number between 1 and 8 written on it.&#10;&#10;The player who played the highest-numbered card wins the trick and is first player for the next. However, during the first four tricks, the player who played the lowest-numbered card, adds a part of the central hill to the middle of the table, marking it with the wooden goat. After the first four tricks, the players know how many goats the central hill supports. This represents the goal limit.&#10;&#10;The winner of the game is the player who collected the most goat's heads without going over the limit dictated by the central hill. A proven strategy is to spam your opponents with the goats that you probably won't need.&#10;&#10;A variant of the game consists of playing a number of rounds equal to the number of players, and totaling the points.&#10;&#10;Contains:&#10;- 50 playing cards&#10;- 12 hill cards&#10;- 1 wooden goat&#10;- 1 rule book&#10;&#10;",

While being linked narratively, each scenario can be played individually, and there's no obligation to play them in the campaign's order.&#10;&#10;Each scenario come as a 6x6 grid, in which you can find different types of colored boxes. Each box's color corresponds to a type of proof, and at the beginning of the game, each player will draw a card for each type of proof on the grid. This combination of cards is your neighbour's solution, so each player will be responsible for the solution of another player. Turn after turn, each player asks select questions that will help not only them, but everyone else playing as well. The goal is to find out your solution before you run out of questions, as you only have a limited number of questions to ask before the scenario ends!&#10;&#10;At the end of the scenario, the players announce what they think their solution is. If everyone is right, you've won. If not, it looks like your group has lost...&#10;&#10;Almost Innocent is higly modular: each scenario has 3 difficulty levels, to accomodate every type of players, from newcomers to experienced veterans of deduction games.&#10;&#10;As you progress throught the scenarios, you'll unlock different modules.

    "description": "Elevenses is a card game in which respectable 1920s socialites strive to serve the finest morning teas!&#10;&#10;Each player starts the round with an identical set of eleven morning tea cards. Each card has a point value as well a special action which must be carried out when it is played. The lower the point value of a card, the better its power. The powers lead to surprising interactions between the players! Cards must also be played to a specific position on the table. Whenever a card is played, in most cases you pick up the card that was previously in its position, requiring you to plan your morning tea carefully!&#10;&#10;The round ends when a player plays the &quot;Elevenses&quot; card. It's time for tea! The players compare the value of their cards. Points are awarded to the highest scoring morning teas. The game continues until a player has 7 or more points. She has served the finest morning teas of all and wins the game!&#10;&#10;The six-card expansion Elevenses: The Special Guests is included in the game. With this expansion, each player is dealt one special guest card in secret at the start of each round. Each guest will come to your morning tea only if you serve certain things. If you play the right combination of morning tea cards, the guest arrives, you reveal the card, and your morning tea goes up in value!&#10;&#10;Game #2 in 'The Mike Line' of games from Grail Games.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "The year is 2123 and the planet earth is becoming uninhabitable. New powers of interstellar travel make it possible for earthlings to find a new home. Competing teams of human explorers use space stations spread throughout the universe as bases for discovering new worlds and befriending aliens to help them in their quest. Explorer teams are not only racing each other, but meteors are striking planets and threatening these new worlds as well. Will your team be able to reach a planet in time to use its resources and protect it from future meteor strikes?&#10;&#10;Cosmic Run is a quick, push-your-luck, space race for 1-4 players. On a turn, a player rolls dice and must commit at least 1 of them to one of the various exploration tracks or to an alien card. Some of the tracks require multiple identical dice, with the most valuable tracks costing many identical dice. However, once a player commits a die, it cannot be moved. So players have to decide between a conservative approach (making sure and steady progress along less valuable tracks) or an aggressive approach (pushing one's luck to try to move up the highly valued tracks).&#10;&#10;Players may opt to use their dice to befriend aliens, rather than explore, because the aliens provide special powers that can eventually help them move along their exploration tracks even faster.&#10;&#10;The game may be played competitively or cooperatively.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "The route-building game genre can be counted as the greatest passion of English game designer and history teacher Martin Wallace. And with La Strada, he has come up with a particularly clever road-building game. Everything &ndash; from the rules to the game play &ndash; is devilishly simple. The game lets players claim successes throughout the game, and turn-by-turn one reaches one or even multiple goals. But at the end, someone else wins? How did that happen?&#10;&#10;The game features a variable game board, built up out of hex tiles that depict easily traveled flatland, forests, or hills. Before the start of the game, nineteen different settlements (ranging from cities to tiny villages) with varying victory point values are randomly placed onto those spaces featuring a gray symbol. Each player then places his or her starting marker onto a chosen flatland tile. The object here is of course to try to put your starting marker near as many high-value cities as possible.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to connect together as many settlements with your roads as possible, in order to get as many victory points as possible. The catch is that settlements award fewer and fewer victory points the more players connect to them. The cities are like pies: the more people want a slice, the smaller the slices have to be.&#10;&#10;Building streets is very simple. One a player&rsquo;s turn, he receives six gold pieces. Each street segment costs two gold to build over flatland, three over forest, and four over hills. Players can build as many segments as they can afford on their turn, provided that they end at a settlement and don&rsquo;t intersect any other streets on the way. Put simply: players can&rsquo;t end a street in the middle of nowhere and then keep building next turn. Streets have to reach their destination at the end of each turn.&#10;&#10;Once a settlement has been reached, and then the player gets to put one of their trade markers on it. Note that streets can intersect each other only at the settlement locations. If a player doesn&rsquo;t use up all of his gold on his turn, then he can save it for the next turn (where he will also get another six gold to play with again). Players aren&rsquo;t allowed to spend more than ten gold pieces on their turn, though, so you can&rsquo;t save forever.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one player can&rsquo;t build any more roads or doesn&rsquo;t have any trade markers left.&#10;&#10;Scoring then occurs. A scoring example for a city: The city is worth five victory points, but only if it was connected to by a single player. A doubly connected city is worth four points for each player, while a triply connected city is only worth three each. Cities connected to by four players are only worth two points. This decreasing point system also counts for smaller settlements, worth between four and two victory points. A nicely thought out sorting system ensures that the end game scoring doesn&rsquo;t turn into a math exercise. Naturally, the player with the most victory points is the winner. In the case of a tie, then the tied player with the most gold left is the winner.&#10;&#10;La Strada is a very simple game: build roads and connect cities. But it&rsquo;s not that easy to get ahead with the scores. It&rsquo;s every player&rsquo;s dream to claim a fat five point city all to themselves &ndash; but a player who spends too much energy trying to protect an investment will find that his other road-building options become tighter.&#10;&#10;[Text is from a preview by Spielbox]&#10;&#10;",

The head vampire, on the other hand, must bluff cleverly, present confusing clues, and trick the humans into attacking innocent citizens. By doing this, the vampire can kill the most important characters in the city or conquer the castle.&#10;&#10;Vampire Empire is a two-player card game with a lot of bluffing and player interaction.  In this very thematic setting, each player possess a unique deck of cards granting different powers, and each player had different goals to win the game!&#10;&#10;",

Each player starts at level 1 and the winner is the first player to reach level 10. Players can acquire familiar D&amp;D style character classes during the game which determine to some extent the cards they can play.&#10;&#10;There are two types of cards - treasure and encounters. Each turn the current players 'kicks down the door' - drawing an encounter card from the deck. Usually this will involve battling a monster. Monsters have their own levels and players must try and overcome it using the levels, weapons and powers they have acquired during the game or run away. Other players can chose to help the player or hinder by adding extra monsters to the encounter. Defeating a monster will usually result in drawing treasure cards and acquiring levels. Being defeated by a monster results in &quot;bad stuff&quot; which usually involves losing levels and treasure.&#10;&#10;Note: The 2012 edition of Munchkin Booty from Pegasus Spiele includes the first expansion, Munchkin Booty 2: Jump the Shark.&#10;&#10;",

The Austro-Hungarians have unique challenges as they try to survive the onslaught of the &ldquo;Russian Steamroller&rdquo; and try to conquer the Serbs in the South.

As time went on and the Austro-Hungarians bounced from one crisis to another, the Germans started to take more control as the price for their aid. In the end, the war was too much for the disparate nationalities of Austria-Hungary to take, and when it became clear that the Central Powers could not win the war, the Austro-Hungarian Empire disintegrated.&#10;&#10;Can you succeed in keeping the Hapsburg Monarchy intact?

How will YOU be remembered?&#10;&#10;Legacies is unique in its integration of primary mechanisms including: multi-use cards, market manipulation, area control/worker placement, variable round-ends, variable player powers, and variable scoring.  Many paths exist to build your fame, but it would be foolish to focus only on your own heirlooms and industries as that path will likely benefit your opponents more than it will benefit you.&#10;&#10;The player cards and entire board evolve throughout the game highlighting inflation, and more importantly, showcasing the visual progression from the 19th century into the 20th and eventually the 21st century creating an effect that carries the player through a journey that truly feels as if it spans 300 years in just a couple of hours of game-play.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

After placing a tile, a player can occupy a room on that tile with one of his three archeologists as long as no other room of the same color is already occupied in that chain. When the chain is closed &mdash; that is, when the chain has no &quot;loose ends&quot; that can be expanded upon &mdash; any archeologists in that chain's room return to their players, and players score 1 point for each archeologist they receive. The game ends when somebody reaches 15 points, and the player who has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Dance of Ibexes, which was first released as Tanz der Hornochsen! (&quot;Dance of the Horned Oxen&quot;) challenges players to place their ibexes/cows on the game board without being pushed over the edge.&#10;&#10;Players start with a random assortment of numbered tiles in hand. The game board depicts multiple rows that will hold tiles, with the rows being of varying lengths and with symbols in some spaces. Draw four tiles at random, and place one in the leftmost space of each of the first four rows.&#10;&#10;Each round, each player selects and reveals a tile at the same time. Tiles are placed on the board in order, from lowest to highest, and which row a tile is placed in is determined according to these rules:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Lowest number: If the played tile's number is lower than that of the end tile of all four rows, place this tile at the end of the row with the highest number.&#10;    Increasing number value: The number on the tile must be higher than the number on the tile that is currently the last tile in that row, but...&#10;    Smallest difference: The tile must be placed at the end of the row where there will be the smallest difference between it and the tile currently at the end of that row. All four active rows must be examined to determine which has the smallest difference.&#10;&#10;&#10;When a player places a tile on a negative space/cowpie, they score that many points, moving their pawn that many spaces on the score track. (If any of the active rows has an uncovered &quot;Happy Cow&quot; space, the player loses points instead of gaining them.)&#10;&#10;When a player places a tile on the final space at the end of a row, that row is completed, and the player must execute the following actions in order:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Score penalty points as shown on the final space by moving their pawn on the score track.&#10;    Move the just-played tile to the first space of the next unoccupied row.&#10;    Remove the remaining tiles from the completed row. Choose one or two to keep behind their player screen, then place the remaining tiles in the box or off to the side as they will not be used for the remainder of the game.&#10;&#10;&#10;At the start of a round, players can purchase 1-3 random tiles from the supply at a cost of 1 point per tile. (If someone plays their final tile in a round, they immediately draw six tiles for free.) A player can have at most nine tiles on hand. If a double play space is uncovered in an active row, then players must play and reveal two tiles. Twice during the game, when a player passes a specified point on the score track, in the next round players reveal their tile choices face up in order from fewest points to most points.&#10;&#10;When a player reaches the end of the score track or no tiles remain to be purchased, finish the round, then the player with the fewest points wins.&#10;&#10;",

A distinctive feature of this game is the multi-part board - there are four boards laid on top of each other, each with holes in it leading 'down' to the next level.  Players move their moles to those holes and, when one board is 'complete' (i.e., all holes occupied), the board, and any moles remaining on it, are removed from play.  Players continue working their way down from level to level, each board having fewer holes than the previous, until they reach the final level, which has only one hole leading to The Golden Shovel.  A simple race-to-the-finish game with fun, colorful playing pieces, just as much fun with or without the kids!&#10;&#10;This game is actually a mild re-working of Inner Circle, also called Top Star, by Virginia Charves.

As a builder, face your opponent in a duel and achieve the greatest influence within its sacred construction. May the gods be propitious to you!&#10;&#10;Tholos is a game of majorities for two players with high interaction. On a turn, you take one of two actions:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Take stones of one color from the quarry into your workshop, with each workshop holding at most three stones. You can take up to three stones of your color (black/white), up to two neutral stones (gray), or one stone of your opponent (white/black).&#10;    Play any stone from your workshop onto the game board. The board has seven locations, each with a unique power, and each location can have a column of at most five stones. If you place a stone of your color in a location, then you take the special action associated with that location, e.g., moving the top stone of a column to another location, moving a stone from the opponent's workshop to your workshop, placing a second stone from your workshop, or returning a played stone to the quarry.&#10;&#10;&#10;When all seven columns have five stones on them, the game ends and players receive points for each column where they have more stones than the opponent &mdash; but this isn't necessarily a good thing. When you score a column, you receive 1 point for each stone of your color, 3 points for each stone of the opposing color, and -2 points for each neutral stone. each column awards points to the player who has the most stones of their color in that column.&#10;&#10;In the advanced mode of Tholos, you place one or more ornament tiles on the game board, each in a different location. Each ornament tile has a power that changes the rules of the game, such as activating the power of a location with gray stones, awarding a column to the player with fewer stones than the opponent, or raising the maximum number of stones in the location's column to seven.&#10;&#10;",

VOLT includes an easy-to-begin training guide but still leaves experienced players with plenty of different modules to make their robot battles even more exciting and merciless.&#10;&#10;Plan your next steps ahead by quickly grabbing a starting number in order for your robot to run or shoot at just the right moment later on.

Instead the commodities are displayed on the board in a number of &quot;nomad camps.&quot;  If your move brings you to a camp, you must present a gift to the camp -- then you can trade your cards for any cards in the camp.  You can also buy goods from the deck at &quot;oasis&quot; squares.  Once you've amassed a number of a particular commodity, you head for the city where that commodity is bought.  There are a few other details to complicate matters, but basically everyone repeats this process until someone has the 500 cash in hand to win the game.  Samarkand is an entertaining exercise with no especially brain-taxing strategies to figure out and makes a good family game.&#10;&#10;This game is sometimes called Bazaar II, because Schmidt Spiele originally published this game under the name Bazaar, even though Bazaar is a completely different game.  Both games are by Sid Sackson.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "The world as we know it is falling apart.&#10;It started out with the appearance of the Void. On that fateful day, the ground trembled, the sky darkened, and rivers turned into dust.&#10;Today, the Outer Lands no longer grant their fruits. Our fields are no longer covered in green. Our children grow weaker by the day. &#10;Nihil is all over us.&#10;We cannot wait any longer. &#10;We must stand against the Void. &#10;It is time to prove that you deserve to be called a Hero. &#10;Lead your Faction in the battle against the Void. &#10;Become a Legend with its defeat... &#10;or fade away, forgotten by all, in an unsuccessful attempt.&#10;It is I, Leafly, &#10;Elder Druid of the Ash&rsquo;Nei Faction and Protector of Nimali, who calls to you.&#10;[Leafly's speech to the XXVII Factions' Ring] &#10;&#10;Legends of Void is a 1-4 player strategy game, based on hand-management, engine-building, and area-control mechanics.&#10; OVERVIEW &#10;You'll play a Hero leading a Faction in the battle against the Void. The Void has summoned Seraphs, god-like creatures who threaten the Outer Lands, draining its life and replacing it with Nihil.&#10;You have a common goal: banish all the Seraphs from the Outer Lands. But you compete with each other to gain the favor of Lumen, the Flying City of the Eternals, rulers of all known lands.&#10;&#10;HAND-MANAGEMENT&#10;During the game, you will buy and cast Lumen scrolls, which have a variety of effects: conjuring animal familiars, gathering magical berries, evoking a fireball, stealing Gold from other players.&#10;Scrolls can increase your production, grant unique actions, and empower your Hero. The game has 216 unique scrolls, and in addition to these, there are 45 Gift scrolls, which are awarded to Heroes during setup to empower and distinguish them even more.&#10;Acquiring a Lumen scroll for your hand costs 3 Gold. Casting a scroll takes Gold, and sometimes additional resources and requirements.&#10;&#10;ENGINE-BUILDING&#10;There are nine types of resources:&#10;&bull;    Gold, Mithril, Mana, and Hero resources. These can be directly produced. &#10;&bull;    Dark Matter and Genasi, which descend from Mana.&#10;&bull;    Creature, Spirit, and Artifact, which can only be present on specific scrolls.&#10;Your basic income of Gold, as well as your base score, is based on your Lumen Rating. It starts at 13 and increases only when you damage a Seraph. You can damage a Seraph in many ways: fighting it directly with your Hero, sealing a Portal, scorching a Nihil, blooming a Vytae, or through actions granted by your Hero, Faction, and certain scrolls. Usually, to damage a Seraph, your Hero or one of your Areas must be near it.&#10;&#10;AREA-CONTROL&#10;The Outer Lands are a map made up of six Regions, randomly chosen from eight double-sided tiles. They form a disc with the Void at its center. The Seraphs threaten every Region. Here and there, Portals and Nihil infect the Lands. In a Stronghold on the edge of the map, you are preparing for the battle.&#10;&#10;GAME FLOW&#10;Legends of Void is split into years and seasons. In each year:&#10;&bull;    Spring: you buy new Lumen Scrolls to expand your options.&#10;&bull;    Summer: you take Actions, spending resources to counteract the Void and its Seraphs.&#10;&bull;    Autumn: you generate more resources to pay for Scrolls and Actions next year.&#10;&bull;    Winter: the Void stirs, and the Seraphs spread corruption across the Outer Lands.&#10;&#10;ENDGAME&#10;Legends of Void ends immediately when one of these happens: &#10;&bull;    You banish all Seraphs, making the Outer Lands safe, and Lumen awards the winning Hero with the title of Legend. &#10;&bull;    You reveal the last Event from the Void-Deck and run out of time. The Void probably erupts, swallowing everything. A Hero still wins, but the Outer Lands are doomed.&#10;Endgame scoring depends on how the game ends. The Hero with the most Lumen Points wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer-&#10;&#10;",

The actions:&#10;&#10;&#10;    KEEP: Place the card face up in front of you, scoring points for it if that color is currently ranked third or fourth in the festival.&#10;    GIVE: Give the card to another player, who places it face up in front of themselves; you score &quot;giving&quot; points based on the current ranking of that color in the festival, plus points equal to the value of that tulip.&#10;    ADD: Place the card face down in the secret festival or add it face up to the festival, altering the ranking of colors if needed so that the color with the highest sum is first, etc.&#10;&#10;&#10;When the deck runs out, shuffle the cards in the secret festival, then draw five at random and add them face up to the festival, adjusting the ranking as needed. (If fewer than five cards are in the secret festival, add all of these cards to the festival.) For the three highest ranked colors in the festival, whoever has the most and secondmost cards in these colors scores points as listed on the festival cards; in games with five and six players, the player with the thirdmost cards of a color also scores points. In case of a tie for card count, the tied player with the higher value of a color wins that tie. Whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

Each player starts with five camels in their color (or six in an introductory game), and the game board is seeded with eight goods on the spaces numbered 1-8, with demand markers placed on the goods at spaces 1, 2, 7 and 8. The first player in the game takes one action, the second player two, and so on until someone takes four actions, after which each player can take up to four actions on their turn. Actions are:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Place or move an unladen camel of your color into an empty space: 1 action&#10;    Place or move an unladen camel of your color into an occupied space: 2 actions&#10;    Pick up a good and place it on the camel in that space: 1 action; if any demand markers are on this space, you keep them.&#10;    Move a good along a chain of your camels, ending with it on top of one of your unladen camels: 1 action&#10;    Steal a good from on top of an opponent's laden camel, placing it under one of your camels in the same space: 1 action and a theft marker; if you have no theft markers, you can't do this.&#10;&#10;&#10;If you move a good to a camel located in the city that wants that good (as indicated by color), then you remove that good from the board and keep it. As soon as four goods have been picked up (not necessarily delivered), pause the game and place a demand marker on each good still on the board; in addition, refill the empty numbered spots with a good from the bag.&#10;&#10;Once the final four goods have been drawn from the bag, the game ends immediately following the next delivery. Players score points based upon what they've collected: Rare goods (of which there are three each of four types) are worth 6 points each; common goods (nine each of four types) are worth 3 points each; and each demand marker is worth 1 point.

During each game, players embark on tricky and mighty quests into ever-changing dangerous caves and dungeons swarmed with monsters and terrible creatures that try to slaughter them, while heroes try to gain treasures as well as better equipment in order to complete the missions.&#10;&#10;Since hordes of monsters repeatedly cross the path of our heroes, bloody clashes are inevitable in order to achieve victory! That is why Super Fantasy uses a simple yet unique dice-based system. Players have a pool of six dice to roll that they manage according to the action they want to perform (such as movement, attack, etc.) and its effectiveness. Each face of the dice shows either a 1, 2 or the Special Power symbol and the sum of the results shown represents the effectiveness of the action performed by the heroes. Every time the Special Power symbol occurs, the hero can choose to charge one of his abilities; once fully charged, the hero can unleash its power against the enemies!&#10;&#10;Super Fantasy features double-sided modular board pieces for creating countless scenarios combinations, six mighty heroes and three unique and powerful abilities for each hero, throwing players into a fast-paced world in which anything can happen!&#10;&#10;",

Power is the currency you will use to buy new, stronger cards to add to your deck. The goal of a deck-building game is to craft your personal deck into a well-oiled machine with the six types of cards that can be acquired: Enemies, Allies, Artifacts, Maneuvers, Fortunes, and Locations. When a player has amassed enough Power, he may defeat more powerful enemies from the &quot;Archenemy&quot; deck, including Shelob, The Witch-King, and the Eye of Sauron! Each card acquired during the game has a Victory Point (VP) value with the Archenemy cards providing the most VPs. In the end, whoever has the most VPs wins.&#10;&#10;Whether played on its own or combined with the other LotR deck-building games from Cryptozoic, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King Deck-Building Game introduces a new feature to the game: a map of &quot;The Journey of the Ring&quot;.

If you&rsquo;ve played a Warhammer Quest game before, you&rsquo;ll recognise the rules, but the mechanics have been updated to be more immersive and deadly.&#10;&#10;Some time ago, Radukar the Wolf saved Ulfenkarn in its darkest hour, but his benevolence didn&rsquo;t last. Claiming the Ebon Citadel, he surrounded himself with fiends, lackeys, and fellow creatures of the dark, forming his Thirsting Court. For a time peace reigned. Then came the Shyish Necroquake, and the Wolf found himself infused with dark power.&#10;&#10;Sallying forth from his castle, Radukar and his court embarked on a murderous rampage. Some were deemed worthy of the Blood Kiss and were turned into vampires themselves &ndash; countless others were left as corpses strewn across the streets. The city now stands on the precipice of total doom. Are there any that would risk their lives and their very souls to save it?&#10;&#10;In Warhammer Quest: Cursed City, you and your friends take on the role of a group of adventurers trying to lift the curse that has befallen the city of Ulfenkarn. Undead creatures stalk the streets.&#10;&#10;Each player chooses one of eight heroes to play.

With each mission, you will learn more about the curse and your nemesis.&#10;&#10;Players roll dice at the beginning of their turn that they can turn into specific actions of the hero that they're playing. Only by working together and balancing their strengths and skills can the heroes hope to survive.&#10;&#10;The game comes with 60 new miniatures, rulebooks, cards, tokens and more.&#10;&#10;The miniatures include:&#10;&#10;8 Heroes:&#10;- Jelson Darrock, Witch Hunter&#10;- Qulathis the Exile, Vampire Hunter&#10;- Emelda Braskov, General&#10;- Dagnai Holdenstock, Kharadron entrepreneur&#10;- Glaurio ven Alten III, Duelist&#10;- Cleona Zeitengale, Missionary&#10;- Octen Glimscry, Necromancer&#10;- Brutogg Corpse-Eater, Ogor Mercenary&#10;&#10;5 Overlords:&#10;- Gorslav the Gravekeeper&#10;- Watch Captain Hagrim&#10;- Torgillis the Chamberlain&#10;- Vrykos Blood-born&#10;- Radukar the Wolf&#10;&#10;38 Additional Adversaries:&#10;6 Dire Bat Swarms&#10;6 Corpse Rat Swarms&#10;2 Kosargi Nightguard Ogor&#10;10 Ulfenwatch Skeleton Warriors&#10;10 Deadwalker Zombies&#10;1 Vargskyr Vampire&#10;3 Vyrkos Blood-born Vampires&#10;&#10;10 Mysterious Object Marker Miniatures&#10;&#10;",

Play as one of four unique factions and assemble your crew of defenders from a wide range of animal characters to resist the machines across a modular map that changes with each game.&#10;&#10;War has come to the Wild. For millennia, animals have weathered shifting alliances and the cycle of hundred-year seasons&mdash;but they&rsquo;ve never faced an enemy like this. An army of machines powered by corrupted magic is rampaging across the Commonwood, enclosing everything in its path and exploiting the warmth of the world. Across the marshes, plains, mountains, and forests, scrappy crews of defenders rise up to resist the machine occupation. The partisans hail from four factions, each determined to fight back in their own way: the Council with its fortitude and bread, the Order with its wisdom of the flame, the Sect with its ingenious inventions, and the Coven with its spells and subterfuge.&#10;&#10;Players are organizers of the animal resistance who have converged on a dangerous flashpoint in the war against the machines. Construction has begun on a new machine core and sprawling factory complex where an animal village once stood. Engines are building walls that enclose habitat after habitat while mechs guard expanding factories and toxic pollution spreads. Organizers must cooperate with each other despite longstanding factional disagreements and help their network of fellow defenders take actions in the right locations and at the right times in order to win this crucial battle. Clear pollution, fight mechs, breach walls, build camps, and rewild factories before the machines complete construction of the core and conquer this region of the Commonwood.&#10;&#10;Can the Defenders band together to heal the land and outsmart a seemingly impossible enemy? Or will the Commonwood succumb to an endless industrial winter? It&rsquo;s up to you and your comrades to decide.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "A boardgame based on a computer game (instead of the other way around) and designed by Klaus Teuber, Anno 1503 views the era of colonization strictly from the home country perspective. Two to four players send ships to explore islands scattered about a 5 x 12 square ocean (the more players, the  more islands). The settlement of the new lands is, however, strictly abstract.&#10;&#10;Each player's turn begins with the roll of one 6-sided die. A &quot;6&quot; is a random event (pirates, fire or good fortune - bad twice as often as lucky, and most likely to damage players who are doing well). On other results, each player gains a commodity from one of his five workshops. The player who rolled may then buy commodities from the bank, sell them to his colonists for gold (no trading among players), or use them in various combinations to recruit new colonists, promote existing ones, or build ships. After that, ships can sail for the unknown lands.&#10;&#10;Each island bears on its hidden side an outpost, a treasure or a trade agreement. After being discovered, these items are brought back to the home country (and the ship is removed from play, requiring the player to build a new one in order to keep searching). Outposts increase the productivity of workshops. Treasure yields either gold or free colonist promotions. Trade agreements reduce the gold needed to buy commodities from the bank.&#10;&#10;Besides being useful in these ways, outposts, gold and agreements are among the game's victory conditions. A player wins by being to first to attain three out of five objectives, namely, four outposts, 30 gold, three trade agreements, three colonists promoted to the top rank of &quot;merchant&quot; and the construction of four public buildings. The buildings (8 types, each bringing some advantage) cost nothing but don't become available until a player has recruited at least four colonists. After that, each new colonist adds a building (unless they've been preempted by other players; there aren't enough for everyone).&#10;&#10;Overall, the game falls squarely into the &quot;simultaneous solitaire&quot; category. Except in the race for islands, the players scarcely interact at all. They do, however, have a great many choices to make in the course of play.&#10;&#10;",

The great valley stretched as far as the eye could see, and the long-awaited promise of prosperity was everywhere.&#10;&#10;In The Secret Valley, each player takes on the role of a clan venturing into mysterious new lands.

The players find out which kind of walls are in certain directions by pressing one of four &quot;arrow buttons&quot; of a &quot;compass&quot; device with a built-in AI (to ensure that each game will have a different house). Walls come in four types: One that allows all animals to pass through, one with a mousehole that allows only mice through, one with a hole in the top that only hares can jump through, and one that's solid and impassable. The players build those walls, creating step-by-step a 3D-labyrinth. The goal of this first phase is to find the &quot;magic doors&quot;, which can be opened only if there is an animal on each side.&#10;&#10;Once the players find the magic doors, the ghost &quot;Hubi&quot; appears. The device gives hints to the players, allowing them to deduce where Hubi is so that ideally they can eventually chase it out of the house.&#10;&#10;Schnappt Hubi! includes three difficulty levels, with a &quot;timer&quot; running in the hardest level that ends the game after a certain number of moves.&#10;&#10;",

Players set up the city by placing one of their roadways with one end on the table and the other end on a column, then topping it with one of their cars. Next, they take turns placing city objects &mdash; buildings, an airport, a tower, a green area &mdash; around the playing area.&#10;&#10;On a turn, expand your highway by adding a new stick to the end of it. When you do so, one end of the stick is placed on the column supporting your most recently played stick and the other end goes on a new column that you add to the table; this new column must contain one more or one fewer column pieces than the column on the other end of the stick. (If you create a column with a yellow piece on top and at least one piece under it, you can break this height restriction rule.)&#10;&#10;If you've built this piece of the roadway so that your stick is the first to cross over or go under an opponent's stick, then you score by placing one of your cars on this roadway. If you cross over or go under multiple sticks on the same placement, you place one car per stick you top or bottom!&#10;&#10;You can branch once from a column of yours topped with a yellow piece. Also, you can place a stick as an exit ramp if one end is placed on a single column piece and the other end on the table. This piece is automatically topped with a car &mdash; but it's also the final placement for this branch of your highway, so don't get stuck in a dead end.&#10;&#10;If you run out of construction materials, you're out of the game. If you're the only one still in the game or you've placed all of your cars, you win.&#10;&#10;Tokyo Highway: Rainbow City includes a &quot;mission&quot; variant in which all of the basic placement rules apply, but your goal is now to score the most points. Every car placed is worth 1 point, three roadways in a row with cars on them is 2 points, a loop around a building is 1 point, an exit ramp at the airport or green area is worth 2 points, placing the same type of car on a roadway as the opponent's car on the road above/below you is worth 1 point, etc.&#10;&#10;In this edition of the game, the roadways have small tacky pads on each end, which makes the sticks more stable than in earlier editions when you placed wood sticks on wood columns.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "On August 9, 1806, Frederick William of Prussia, in reaction to the recent creation of the Confederation of the Rhine by Napoleon, decreed the order of mobilization. War becomes unavoidable. &#10;&#10;The Prussian army concentrates on Erfurt without waiting for the troops of its Russian ally. Outrunning his opponents, Napoleon enters Saxony with the Grand Army on October 7, 1806 and heads for Berlin.&#10;&#10;A week later the Prussians, defeated at Jena and Auerstedt, retreat North. The pursuit led by the Murat cavalry can begin... &#10;&#10;When the game meets history:&#10;&#10;&quot;Napoleon 1806&quot; is a wargame at the crossroads of history and simulation, the culmination of two history and wargame enthusiasts, Denis Sauvage and Julien Busson, who wished to share this passion with you. &#10;With Napoleon 1806, in 1 to 2 hours, two players will relive the clashes between Prussian and French at the heart of the imperial conquests of Napoleon the 1st, which culminated in the battles of Auerstaedt and Jena.&#10;&#10;Napoleon 1806 is intended for wargaming seasoned grognards as well as for young conscripts who want to try a new playful sensation. Strategy, anticipation and decision are the engines of the Napoleon 1806 game system.&#10;&#10;The rules of Napoleon 1806 are divided into three parts and can be learnt in fifteen minutes. The first one, called &quot;Rules of the Conscript&quot;, allows to acquire all the notions of the game easily. The second, &quot;Rules of the Grognard&quot;, brings more finesse including &quot;fog of war&quot;. The last, &quot;Rules of the Marshal&quot;, allows to play Napoleon 1806 in competition.&#10;&#10;Will you meet the challenge of doing as well as the Emperor Napoleon or will you succeed in thwarting his plans at the head of the Prussian forces?&#10;&#10;How to play Napoleon 1806:&#10;&#10;A game of Napoleon 1806 is played in 7 turns, each representing two days of campaign. Players alternate operations with their army corps. Fatigue and losses accumulate until the breaking point of one of the two armies causing the defeat of a player.&#10;&#10;The game is based on cards to perform moves and combats. Even if luck is present, strategy is key to victory. Moving your army corps on different approach paths to facilitate maneuvers, managing the fatigue of your men generated by marching and fighting, concentrating your forces in order to win the decisive battle; these are the challenges you will face.&#10;&#10;The French troops are more numerous and more experienced than those of their opponent, but time is short before the arrival of the Russian reinforcements, and the Prussian army is not to be underestimated! The French player to win will have to master the art of attacking and speed of action. The Prussian player, although defensive, will have to seize the opportunities presented to him to counter-attack and surprise his opponent. As the game is fast, each player will have the opportunity to take charge of the fate of both armies in one evening.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Each player in Tr&auml;xx has an erasable game board that features lots of colored hexagons shaped into a larger hexagon, with the numbers 2-10 being scattered across this playing area. While the color and number arrangement is the same on all player boards, the starting point differs on each board. (The second edition of Tr&auml;xx includes a pad of individual score sheets instead of erasable boards.)&#10;&#10;To play, shuffle the deck of fifteen cards, then reveal the top card, which will show four or five colored hexagons. Playing at the same time, each player takes an erasable pen and draws a path on their game board &mdash; with this path starting at or at least passing through the starting point on their board &mdash; that covers up to as many hexagons as were revealed, with the colors of the hexagons in your path matching those shown on the card. Thus, if the card shows two gray hexagons and one each of blue, red and yellow, then your path can cover at most two gray hexagons and one each of blue, red and yellow.&#10;&#10;Once all players have drawn their path, reveal the next card, continuing the path in either direction and covering only as many hexagons of the proper colors as is shown on that card. A path cannot cross itself.&#10;&#10;When your path crosses a number, call out that number. If you're the first one to reach it, you'll score that many points at game end; if others have reached it first, you score half this many points, rounded up. Once you've finished all fifteen cards, the game ends and you lose one point for each space not covered. Whoever has the highest score wins!&#10;&#10;",

However, technical progress was due not only to the ever-growing traffic network, but was accelerated by the construction of more and more powerful locomotives.&#10;&#10;Locomotive Werks is an economic game in which players purchase the ability to produce engines, pay workers to produce them, and sell to the volatile, dice-driven market. The game is best known for its unique market mechanism in which the demand for older train models dries up, often at a rapid pace as new technology is implemented.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "10' to Kill is a deduction game for 2-4 players that's played in about ten minutes. There are 16 characters on the board, and each player secretly embodies one of them. Each player also has three secret targets they must eliminate, without being discovered. The players have two actions each turn from the following choices: move any character anywhere on the board, eliminate a character (different ways of doing this), or make an identity check by the police. The trick is that when a character is eliminated, nobody says by whom or how! You must apply yourself in blending your true hitman in a crowd of possible suspects, or guess which character is the hitman of the other players.&#10;&#10;As time goes by in 10' to Kill, you will feel pressure and suspicion weigh on your shoulders. Ten minutes is a short time, but it can sometimes be very long when all eyes are on you! You'll have to bluff and use discretion to eliminate your targets...and maybe the competitor's hitman!&#10;&#10;Are you ready to become the most prestigious hitman?&#10;&#10;",
