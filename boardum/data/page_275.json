Players compete to get rid of their cards first, while trying to avoid the heavily-armed Joker (the weakest card in the deck).&#10;The key differences between this game and standard War are:&#10; - The Joker is the lowest card in the deck - it loses to every other card.&#10; - When players put down cards of the same rank, instead of having a &quot;war&quot; right away, they cooperate and by trading decks, then have a war.&#10; - The first player to get rid of all his/her cards wins.&#10;&#10;The suits are of different icons (peace symbols, unity symbols, hearts with an arrow through it, etc) from a normal deck of cards and the deck includes one blank card which can be used to replace a lost or damaged card OR create a new wild card.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Tetris the Card Game is based on the popular video game Tetris.&#10;&#10;In this game, the players' goal is to clear 10 lines to win the game.  Players keep a grid of 10 cards face up in front of them, flipping them as lines are cleared to keep track of their score.  Each player may hold two cards at a time in their hand.  Cards may feature blocks known as Tetriminos which can be used to clear lines or special action cards that can hinder other players.&#10;&#10;A puzzle will be displayed on the top of the draw pile.  To clear a line, players must use the Tetrimino cards in their hands.  If the Tetrimino on a card fits in this puzzle so that it completes a line (or lines) five squares across without any gaps, it can be played to clear a line (or lines).  In order to fulfill this goal, Tetriminos may be rotated.  For each line cleared, a card is flipped in that player's matrix.  If clearing a line is impossible with the player's hand or if no action cards may be played, then the player must discard a card of their choice and draw the top card of the draw pile.  The next player takes their turn and play proceeds until one player has flipped all ten cards in their matrix.&#10;&#10;",

Your choices will guide you through different storylines, from the seductive merfolk in the lagoon, to the brave natives in the mountains and all the other secrets the island has to offer. Gain allies and items, unlock new abilities, interact with locations and characters and gain experience during multiple adventures. As everybody's Neverland is different, every game will be a new adventure, with new possibilities and challenges to face. Although there will be a winner at the end of the game, the unfolding of the stories on the immersive island of Neverland are key.&#10;&#10;In this story driven adventure game, 2-4 players take on the role of a main character in the world of J.M Barrie&rsquo;s &ldquo;Peter Pan&rdquo;. The game takes around 30 minutes per player, is played in turns and is suitable from the age of 12. The base game includes 6 characters with unique stats and abilities, each with a competitive story. In addition the base game includes one cooperative story for multiple characters. Additional stories can be added and combined. Adventures are narrated through story cards, happenings, and side quests of your choice. You can interact with other characters and locations on the island. While the immersive stories ensure you'll find yourself in a world of wonder and mystery, the players' choices will re-imagine Neverland every time you play the game.&#10;&#10;The game is played in turns. Each turn a player has 3 actions to move and interact with player characters and non-player characters. Players explore the island of Neverland while interacting with stories, happenings, other characters and special locations. The story, goal and challenges are narrated through cards with multiple available options. As every chapter of every player poses multiple outcomes, your adventures on Neverland will be different every time you play. Players can earn adventure points to level up their character. &#10;The game ends when the side quest deck runs out or all players finish their story. The player with the most adventure points wins the game. (Cooperative stories may have different end of game and win conditions)&#10;&#10;The game is suitable from the age of 12 and takes about 30 minutes per player.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "From the Press Release:&#10;&#10;What's Yours Like?&trade; is the new party game from Patch Products where players share side-splitting laughs while coming up with clever, witty and outrageous clues. Descriptions should be truthful, yet clever, so the player in the hot seat doesn't get an easy guess.&#10;&#10;In this game, all players except the one in the hot seat look at a guess word and then creatively describe what theirs is like. They might be telling about their swimsuit, neighbor, closet, hair or any of the other 300-plus words in the game. The player in the hot seat then tries to link all the clues together to figure out what is being described. The best part about this game is that the hilarious clues come from people who play the game. The player who guesses his or her word with the fewest number of clues wins.&#10;&#10;What do you think players are describing with these clues?&#10;&#10;Mine keeps getting bigger.&#10;&#10;I compare mine with others.&#10;&#10;My wife likes mine.&#10;&#10;I never see mine.&#10;&#10;I receive mine once a month.&#10;&#10;You wouldn't believe what I do for mine.&#10;&#10;Mine disappears too fast.&#10;What's Yours Like? is for 4 or more players ages 10 to adult.&#10;&#10;",

It combines varieties of movement, combat and objectives rarely found in actual warfare.&#10;&#10;First published in Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #37, Jim Dunnigan transformed the game of Football into a wargame, with limited success.&#10;&#10;Played on a hex map football field (6 hexes = 10 yards), players set up their teams and run plays.  Rules cover all aspects of the sport: facing, movement, contact, transferring the ball, passing and running.  The standard 'Combat Results Table' in most wargames becomes the 'Contact Results Table', where players are neutralized for a number of play segments or immobilized for the turn.  On passing plays, a 'Pass Completion Table' is consulted.&#10;&#10;Extensive examples of play are included for both running and passing.  However, no rules are included for kickoffs/punts or Field Goal attempts.&#10;&#10;",

This is the tile just before the first pad of the map.&#10;&#10;Each Turn&#10;&#10;Each then you roll a die; this determines the maximum spaces you can move in any direction. The first player may re-roll on the first turn.&#10;&#10;You then pick a pad to land on. There are 4 types of pads:&#10;&#10;Green Pads: Land here safely&#10;Yellow Pads: When land, flip a frog coin; if it lands on heads, you lose a life. &#10;Red Pads: Lose a life when you land here. &#10;Dark Green: Like green pads, but you cannot dunk a player who is on them. These pads usually have flies, as shown above.&#10;&#10;When you land on a pad, you automatically gain the number of flies indicated. It is now in your possession. The flies are then removed from the lilypad and cannot be gained by another player.&#10;&#10;You can also land on a pad another player is already on. When this occurs, you may attempt to dunk them.&#10;&#10;Dunking&#10;When you land on the same pad as an existing player, you can choose whether to try to dunk them. If you want to, roll the frog dice. If it's an even number, you can move that far, and they lose a life. If it's odd, you may not move. However, if it's a 1, you lose a life.&#10;If you die holding flies, they FLY back to the location they come from and can once again be claimed by another player. &#10;Notes:&#10;You must roll for the pad first when attempting a dunk on yellow/red. You may leapfrog even if you lose a life, provided you have not been eliminated.&#10;When there are 2 or more people on a pad, you dunk them all!&#10;&#10;Lives&#10;&#10;Each player starts with 5 lives. Upon running out of lives, a player is eliminated and loses the game without any further actions possible.&#10;&#10;Goal&#10;Collect flies, and return them to the start point. The winner is the (living) player with the most flies at the end. Once you've returned, you cannot go out again.&#10;&#10;Optional Rules&#10;&#10;An optional rule is Fly Stealing. When this rule is chosen, a player steals a fly from any opponent they successfully dunk.&#10;&#10;",

The first player turns a card from the deck in the middle of the table. The color of the card defines what to do. If a yellow card shows up, the player can use as many cards as he wants to spell a word using the letters in the yellow corner of the cards in his hands.&#10;If a red card shows up, the player has to count the numbers in the red corner of the card to make exactly 11. &#10;When a blue card shows up, the player has to make a puzzle using the circles in blue corner. &#10;And when a green card shows up, the player may play all cards in his hand with the same instrument.&#10;&#10;If a player can't play any card, he/she can play an action card or draw a card. The player who discarded(plays) all of his/her cards first wins the game.&#10;&#10;Comes with a collectible tin and clear plastic cards.&#10;&#10;This game is/was a Starbucks exclusive game. It was also sold at select Barnes and Noble stores that also had a Starbucks coffee shop.&#10;&#10;",

However instead of numbers, letters and words take center stage.&#10;&#10;Players still have a maximum of 3 rolls in a given turn but now players have 7 dice at their disposal. The dice in Word Yahtzee contain a set of letters similar to that on offer in Scrabble and each letter is also tagged with a value, which is used in creating a score when a player meets one of the criteria.&#10;&#10;The targets to aim for include words of certain lengths (top half of the score pad), whilst the bottom half includes categories such as 2 words, 3 words, all vowels and all consonants to name a few.&#10;&#10;To achieve a Yahtzee a player must be able to form a 7-Letter word.&#10;&#10;At the end of each game the highest score is declared the winner but like classic Yahtzee, players an play all 6 games featured on a single page and combine those scores to play a more epic game.&#10;&#10;Word Yahtzee is a word dice game.&#10;&#10;",

There are limited welly boots and several features to lay on, so the choice on where and whether to claim features is the key part of the game.&#10;&#10;Completing a feature allows the player to score points and to claim back their welly boots for further use. Using a spade card allows the player to capture welly boots on the tile that is flipped as well as potentially completing features.  Players have the option of a short 30 minute game to reach pre-agreed points totals or a longer game in which all tiles are played. the player with the highest points total wins.&#10;&#10;The set comprises a scoreboard, 96 tiles, 8 spade cards, 4 counters and 4 different coloured sets of 7 welly boots, and a tile bag.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

No two games will ever play the same.&#10;&#10;Gameplay is structured around a clever movement mechanism in which the first player moves one card, the second player moves up to two cards, the third player three, and so on. Each of the six player characters has both advantages and disadvantages that can be used across a variety of play options &mdash; short or long play, regular or advanced.&#10;&#10;Dive into caves, row canoes, cross bridges, climb mountains, and cut through treacherous underbrush as you stop at nothing &mdash; except bears &mdash; to be the first to reach base camp. Can you survive and escape Bear Valley?&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "FROM the SESSION REPORT:&#10;&#10;Each player is competing to pull off the most lucrative scams. You do this by spamming mailing lists. The more closely related the mailing list is to the type of scam you're trying to pull, the easier it is to score.&#10;&#10;Scams come in 4 types - sex, internet, money and free stuff. The text and art flavor are quite wonderful. Of course the sex scams appeal the most - highlights were the Virtual Jellorama, Walter's Wankery and Disgusting Dog Tricks. If you're geeky, some of the internet scams are witty. All the standard 'make money doing nothing' and free stuff scams are there as well.&#10;&#10;You play scam cards in front of you (up to 5) and then play mail-out cards (spams) trying to lure people in. There are a number of mailing lists of various sizes in the middle for anyone to mail to, plus each player has some private mailing lists that only they can spam. The action is to play a 'mail' card, nominating both a scam and the list that you're mailing the scam offer to. If you roll a d6 less &lt;= the size of the list, you succeed, and that scam scores a point. If you roll way under (4 or more), your scam scores 2 points. Some lists specialize in one of the 4 scam types ... if your scam and the list matches, you get a modifier of +2 making it easier to score, plus the mail-out cards have modifiers between 0 and +5.&#10;&#10;Simple so far, but every time a mailing list gets spammed, it decreases in size by 1 (1 million thematically which equals 1 on the die) - these are subscribers getting disgruntled by the amount of spam they're receiving who leave the list.&#10;&#10;The winner is the first person to get 20 points across all their scams, or who gets a single scam of 12 points BUT it's only checked at the start of your next turn.&#10;&#10;A turn consists of 3 actions surrounding 2 decks - list cards and action cards. An action is pick up a card, play a card or merge 2 lists (making one bigger list you can then mail to). The action cards consist of scams, mail-outs or hardware cards. Hardware cards are played in front of you and allow you to break the game rules in a prescribed way (eg can mail other's private lists). Mail-out cards also list special effects which vary from mundane to wildly powerful but generally allow you to hose other players. When you play one, you say whether you're mailing or playing the special effect.&#10;&#10;To the game play itself. You try to get a mail-out going every turn (you're only allowed one) and pick a scam / list combination that gives you the best chance of scoring 2 points rather than 1 point. If you only get 1 point, you may well be falling off the pace. You're generally picking up at least one card each turn, and this can be a slow process as any special action needs to be read and understood to work out whether you want to use the card as a mail-out or for the special effect. So it's not the fastest game in the world. These hostage cards also make it a big hit the leader game. If you're going to make a dash for the lead have plenty of protection cards because you have to maintain your winning score for a full round before you win - everyone gets a shot at you.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "BASIC DESCRIPTION:&#10;The UNO Dice Game attempts to translate the original UNO card game into a two player dice game.  It was released during the 2011 Christmas season and displayed along with other Mattel dice games in the same type of soda can tin packaging.&#10;&#10;COMPONENTS:&#10;The game includes 11 dice.  Each die is unique and has some combination of faces in the four UNO colors (yellow, green, blue and red).  The die faces include: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, draw one, draw two, and wild (in black).  Note that there are no die faces that represent the Skip or Reverse cards from the original UNO card game (presumably because this is just a 2 player game).&#10;&#10;GAMEPLAY:&#10;The game mechanic is simple and mimics the original UNO card game.  To begin, 5 dice are randomly given to each of the two players.  These dice take the place of a players hand of cards in the original UNO card game.  The 11th die is left in the middle of the play area to form the start of the dice line (think UNO discard stack from the original card game).  The starting player rolls their dice and has to match either the color or value of the most recently placed die in the dice line.  That player's matching die is placed in the dice line and will have to be matched by the next player.  Play continues as players take turns rolling their hand of dice and adding one matching die from their hand to the dice line each turn until they only have one die left in their hand.  The player must then say &quot;UNO!&quot; or be penalized.  The penalty for not remembering to say &quot;UNO!&quot; is similar to the draw one and draw two die faces:  the affected player must take the appropriate number of dice from the end of the dice line.  The first player with no dice left wins.  The winning player's score is based on the faces of the dice left in front of their opponent.  Alternate rules are provided to ignore scoring and simply play the best out of 3 games.&#10;&#10;PACKAGING:&#10;This edition was packaged in a creative looking tin that was made to resemble an aluminum soda can--complete with Nutrition Facts label.  The top of the can pops off (twist to open).  The one sheet of rules and 11 dice fit inside the tin with a cardboard insert to help dampen the sound of the dice in the tin.  The tin also has a coin slot in the top that holds the a plastic hook to allow it to be hung for selling/display purposes.&#10;&#10;",

You'll still encounter all the elements that make UNO so unpredictable and challenging, but add to that a motorized card launcher that shows no mercy and you've got UNO Attack. The object of the game is still to get rid of all your cards. The UNO command cards direct the game by telling players when to trade hands, discard, reverse the playing order, or skip a player. Beware the dreaded Hit command, though, as this translates into a game of Russian roulette. You never know when the card launcher is going to fire off a stream of UNO cards just for you! For 2 to 10 players. Requires three C batteries (not included).&#10;&#10;112 cards as follows:&#10;&#10;18 Blue cards: 2 each - 1 to 9&#10;18 Green cards: 2 each - 1 to 9&#10;18 Red cards: 2 each - 1 to 9&#10;18 Yellow cards: 2 each - 1 to 9&#10;8 Hit 2 cards: 2 each in blue, green, red and yellow&#10;8 Reverse cards: 2 each in blue, green, red and yellow&#10;8 Skip cards: 2 each in blue, green, red and yellow&#10;4 Discard All cards: 1 each in blue, green, red and yellow&#10;4 Trade Hands cards: 1 each in blue, green, red and yellow&#10;4 Wild cards&#10;2 Wild All-Hit cards&#10;2 Wild Hit-Fire card&#10;&#10;2010 Edition Changes:&#10;&#10;     Trade Hand cards are replaced with another set of Discard All cards&#10;     Wild All-Hit and Wild Hit-Fire cards are replaced with 4 Wild Attack-Attack cards&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Players represent the Chief Operations and Marketing Officers of major American airlines, whose job is to fly the most passengers over a given period of time.&#10;&#10;There are two basic games in Airlines: the One-Year Quick Game which takes about 45 minutes to play and the Three-Year Game, which takes about two hours to play. The currency of the game is seats, seats are used to pay for everything. The game is card-based, with a small map to show distances between Major and Regional Airports. The cards consist of Major Airports, Regional Airports, various Aircrafts, airline Hubs (your airline), Gates, and varied Opportunity/Events cards. The Ops/Events cards may denote bad weather in a region (thus reducing number of seats for that round), strikes (which can played on another airline), Fuel Price Adjustments (which effect your maintenance fees paid with Seats), and even an Aircraft Incident card (which people outside the industry call &quot;crashes.&quot;)&#10;&#10;Airlines can be combined with the stand-alone game Airlines: United States Set 2.&#10;&#10;",

Each player then secretly commits a ship card to it from their hand of five.  The winner of the round is the player whose ship best meets the mission's criteria.&#10;&#10;Ships are rated for Space Combat, Marines, Diplomacy, Science, and Cargo.  Most missions will only use one of these (i.e., &quot;highest Space Combat wins&quot;) while some use two combined (i.e., &quot;highest total of Science and Cargo wins&quot;).  A few missions add special conditions; ships sent to defend against Gorn attack may not be Gorn, for example, while the Romulan Civil War excludes all but Romulans, and negotiations with alien pacifists go to the highest Diplomacy after Space Combat and Marines are subtracted.&#10;&#10;From the rule sheet cover:&#10;&#10;Star Fleet Missions is a card game played with two decks of cards:  Ship Cards and Missions Cards.&#10;&#10;Each Ship Card represents a starship.  there are 18 cards for each of six &quot;races&quot; (Federation, Klingon, Romulan, Gorn, Tholian, and Orion Pirate), for a total of 108.  (Race means &quot;nation&quot; or &quot;empire.&quot;)&#10;&#10;Each Ship Card shows the class (type of ship), the name of the specific ship, and five Ratings which are used to determine the suitability of a ship for a given Mission.  These Ratings vary from 1 to 16.&#10;&#10;The other two Ship Cards represent starships with Legendary Captains and are the most powerful Ship Cards in the game.  All five Ratings are 20!&#10;&#10;Each Mission Card describes an exciting mission on which you will send one or more starships.  Each Mission Card describes the Mission, tells how many ships to send on the Mission, provides any special instructions, and describes how to &quot;win&quot; that Mission (i.e., which Ratings of the ships sent will be used to determine which ship performed the best.)&#10;&#10;",

Both the Church and the monastic Parkover Brothels deny the authenticity of the game.  As one official noted, &quot;that's a crock&quot;.&#10;&#10;Bureaucracy is designed to simulate the bureaucratic behavior which constitutes so much of what we call government.  It is convoluted, Byzantine, and entertaining.  It is also cost effective, feasible, and administratively impossible.  In its early stages, Bureaucracy required a fifteen story parlor, a six acre gameboard, 200,000 pieces, and a 15,000 page rulebook.  Of course, this prototype was unwieldy.  Consequently, we were forced to simplify the game.  The present version is good for two to eight players.&#10;&#10;Each player starts the game at the lowest organizational level.  The winner is the player who rises up through the masses to become the Director of the Bureaucracy.&#10;&#10;Players may select one of four lifestyles, each with its own advantages and disadvantages: lifer, over achiever, empire builder, or hustler.  To be promoted from level to level, a player will need the required number of promotional prerequisites and that's where the fun comes in.  All sorts of things can happen.  Players may be demoted.  They may be involved in scandals.  They may become involved in power plays.  They may have to go before a Grievance Committee.  A player may even go bankrupt and have to start all over from the bottom again.  There is no one sure formula for success.  Players will have to stay out of trouble and use all their cunning to succeed.&#10;&#10;This is a game that makes being a part of the bureaucracy fun  It will make you laugh at government and yourself at the same time.    For civil servants, it's required recreation.  For just you and me, it's a must.  Don't be surprised though, when you open the box and hear the call of the jungle.  It's a wild game.&#10;&#10;Game includes a 22 x 24 gameboard, 2 dice, 240 promotional prerequisite pieces, 20 power play pieces, 64 player tokens, a pack of money, 80 lifestyle cards, 20 memo cards, 20 consumer goods cards, 8 bucks, 1 power file, and two rulebooks (one to explain what it says in the simple game rules)&#10;&#10;",

There are 6 types of commodity spread across the 5 continents and players must control these to satisfy two different winning conditions. So to win, you might need to control two tractors and two factories for one condition, and one commodity in each continent for your second condition. Alternately, the first player to earn 1 million wins.&#10;&#10;There are decks of cards; Country (which shows a commodity in a country and a price, e.g. Factories are in Britain and cost 70,000), Yes (good stuff), No (bad stuff), Auftrag (winning conditions). You start with some cash money, a few countries and two Auftrag. For the countries you own, you put the plastic commodity onto your colored disc onto the country. So the player owning Britain puts a factory on one of their discs onto Britain. This way, ownership can be seen and can change.&#10;&#10;The game is driven by two dice. The player rolls them, chooses one for itself and the other for the player on the left to use. The dice are marked Buy, Sell, Country, Yes, No, Cash. Buy means you can buy a commodity/country from another player - regardless of whether they want to sell it - at the price on the card. There is also a red die you can roll to gamble on the price, making it higher or lower. Sell means you may sell a Country back to the bank. Country means you draw a Country card and place the commodity on your disc on it. Yes/No means you draw from the appropriate deck and apply the result, e.g. all players get a dividend, or pay a tax, etc. Cash means you move a marker on the board and whoever has that commodity or continent gets a bonus.&#10;&#10;Since the game is completely driven by two dice, it is pure chance if a good thing or bad thing happens to a player. Due to the nature of the dice, the cards, and the rules, it is quite possible for the game to end in the first round. ...or it can go on forever.  [See Fluxx.]&#10;&#10;",

Players control dwarves mining mithril and gems on a randomly assembled tile-based board. After each player's turn, he or she rolls a die and chooses a tile with that number on it at one end of the board for Magdar to destroy. Any dwarves on the destroyed tile are sent back to the cavern entrance and lose anything they were mining at the time. The game ends when one row of tiles has been completely destroyed. Scoring is based upon having a good mix of mithril and gems. Other elements such as claim jumping are added in the advanced version of the game.&#10;&#10;",

(&quot;Simply Ingenious: Whoever Risks Too Much Loses!&quot;) is a tile game related to the Ingenious board game in that players are once again collecting as many points as possible in each color/symbol while also needing to score points in all colors/symbols in order to do well.&#10;&#10;To start the game, mix all 126 tiles (21 of each color/symbol) face down, then turn three face up and place them in a shared pool in the center of the table. On a turn, a player flips a tile face up. If the tile doesn't match one of those in the pool, he adds all tiles revealed this turn to the pool and ends his turn; if it does match, the player can either end his turn and collect the face-up tiles before him and all matching tiles in the pool, or take another turn.&#10;&#10;If you're the first player to collect seven tiles of each color, you win. (With four players, the goal is five tiles.) Any tiles of a color you collect over seven are shuffled back into the supply.&#10;&#10;If a player has a single color with fewer tiles in it than all other colors and a tile of that color is in the pool, the player can take one such tile and end his turn; this rule allows players to work toward that final color they need, while also pushing other players to try to remove that color from the pool. If the pool ever has fewer than three face-up tiles, reveal tiles and add them to the pool until three tiles are available.&#10;&#10;Einfach Genial: Wer zu viel riskiert, verliert! was later released as one of three games in Fantasy Flight Games' Ingenious Challenges.&#10;&#10;",

This champion must have a strong will, strength, magic, intelligence, persuasive abilities and is proven to be a survivor. Thus the Queens banished all Heroes and Villains into a fierce competition to see who will survive the Fairytale Games. There will be only one.&#10;&#10;Fairytale Games: The Battle Royale is a 1-10 player dice-based board game that uses cards as the board (for land exploration). Movement is with a 6-sided die. When you begin the game, you and other players start at the same location and begin revealing locations/terrain as you roll your die. Some locations offer opportunities to start quests to gain survival items or allow you to explore more lands and gain better abilities. All the while Events are happening that might help or hinder you greatly. There are 30+ character cards that you can play as or fight against in this game. Other cards include Action Cards, Event Cards, Location Cards, Quest Cards and Item Cards. A normal game duration is about 30 minutes to 1 hour depending on the number of players.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to kill off at least ten fairytale characters in the game in addition to your opponent before they can do the same to you. If playing a one-player game, you must kill twenty characters. The other way you can win is if you complete certain Quest challenges as a team to escape the realm or to take the entire place down with you by finding the slim opportunities through certain card scenarios to defeat the three Queens.&#10;&#10;Although Action Cards allow you to strategically attack, defend, hinder, or help another player, your character cards themselves have their own special abilities that can be used during certain situations through dice rolling or if they are activated by Quests, Events or other Action Cards.&#10;&#10;",

Each team takes it in turns to answer yes/no questions about the opposite team in one of four categories:  &quot;Fears and Pet Peeves&quot;, &quot;Ancient History&quot;, &quot;Literature&quot; and &quot;It's all Relative&quot;. This is done by submitting Yes/No cards face down for simultaneous reveal with the correct answer(s) from the other team. Some questions are about one member of the opposite team - in which case all members of the answering team submit a guess - and some questions are of the style &quot;Which of us...?&quot;, in which case the answering team collaborates for a yes/no answer for each member of the opposite team. The goal is to answer the most questions correctly about the other team and have the highest points total at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;There is also a bonus round - and here the gender divide does matter, because the game is designed so that the boys are asking the girls questions that are supposedly hard for the girls to answer but that the boys themselves should easily know the answer to, and vice versa (no answers are provided for the bonus questions). The bonus round is timed and each team answers as many questions correctly as they can within the time limit.&#10;&#10;",

The object is to get all your plane pieces into the base of your color in the center of the map.&#10;&#10;Each player has 4 planes in their starting base. Each turn you roll the die and move one plane of your color on the board.  To get your planes out of your base and onto the board you must roll a 6.  You get an extra turn whenever you roll a 6. If your plane happens to end up on top of another person's plane, that person's plane must go back to their base until he or she rolls a 6 again to get it out onto the board.&#10;&#10;On the board there are colored spaces that coincide with each player. If you land on your own color, you can immediately jump to the next block of your color.  There are also certain colored squares that offer shortcuts across the board.  You may only use the shortcuts that coincide with your color.  If you land on a colored square and subsequently jump to a shortcut square, you may also take the shortcut (essentially jumping twice in one turn).  If you ever land on your own piece, you may &quot;stack&quot; the pieces and move them as one piece until they reach the center or are landed on by an opponent and sent back as individuals.&#10;&#10;The first player to get all of their planes to the center of the board wins, and the rest play until there is only 1 loser. To land in the center of the board, you must roll the exact amount of spaces.&#10;&#10;It is very similar to Pachisi and especially Aggravation. There is no indication of a specific designer or publisher as the game is a classic from China, so it is now probably a public domain game. As is the case for Go, there are different packages for it with different colored/designed pieces&#10;&#10;",

It's the classic stacking game with a Tetris twist. The blocks are shaped like the ones in the electronic Tetris game, so it's a brand new challenge to pull them out and stack them on top. And just like Tetris, if you can complete a level so it's solid, with no gaps, you get an advantage &ndash; you can choose the next player. The last one to pull out a block without bringing the whole stack crashing down is the winner. Play against yourself or take on your friends in the stacking, pulling, crashing challenge of Jenga Tetris.&#10;&#10;",

Here are some ways that it is different:&#10;&#10;1) You win when you have $1 million in cash.&#10;2) You can upgrade your playing piece to have a better chance of winning.  (Your salary for passing Go is bumped up, and you can potentially make more money from the Chance/Millionaire Lifestyle cards.)&#10;3) Property spaces start with Fortune cards on them. (These allow you to build houses for free, force you to auction a property, or even allow you to steal properties from other players.)&#10;4) No paper money.  All the money is on little tiles.&#10;4) No banker necessary because the money tiles are placed in the middle of the board.&#10;5) No taxes, no railroads, no utilities.  The board only has 8 spaces per side instead of the usual 10.&#10;&#10;Otherwise most of this game is stuff you will recognize from the original.  Many gamers will be pleased to hear that this game puts a stronger focus on auctioning unpurchased properties, instead of the classic house rule of leaving it unowned.  Also the $1-million victory reduces the odds of player elimination and multi-hour games.&#10;&#10;",

Properties are now only bought in the bank and not on landing on the square.&#10;&#10;2) Stocks&#10;Stocks can be bought in one of the 7 sets of properties and gives you money by dividend paid from the bank and dividend paid from the owner of properties.&#10;&#10;3) Car&#10;In Finans you have the opportunity to buy (and later sell if you are short on cash) a car which gives you two dices to roll instead of just one. Having a car makes jumps over the expensive properties more easy. You still only use one die inside the Bank.&#10;&#10;4) Bonds&#10;Bonds can be bought in the Bank by all players if a player land on one of the two bond squares. Each bond has a number from 2 to 12 and pays out if the number is rolled using two dices.&#10;&#10;The 1998-variant from Brio is a revised version of &quot;Finans&quot; by Anders Jeppson and Per Leveaux originally designed by &quot;Martin Marte&quot;. &quot;Finans&quot; means &quot;Finance&quot; but is different from Parker Brothers version from 1933.&#10;&#10;So far I have only seen this game sold in Scandinavia (Denmark, Sweden, Finland &amp; Norway).&#10;&#10;",
