Link travels through 6 different worlds attempting to rescue Princess Zelda.&#10;&#10;Before play begins, tiles are placed face-down on the board in each world. Players receive three heart chips and an attack die. The first player rolls the numbered die and moves Link a number of spaces as shown. When a player lands on a square, he/she turns over one of the tiles and does the following:&#10;&#10;-A magic tile that is found is kept until the end of the game. Finding this tile also allows access to the next world.&#10;&#10;-A monster tile is fought using everyone's attack die. The number of swords must be greater than or equal to the monster power shown on the tile. You can lose or gain hearts when fighting monsters.&#10;&#10;Once in the 6th world, the magic tile is &quot;Triforce Princess Zelda&quot;. In order to keep the tile, the player must roll 4 swords and is able to reroll once if 2 or more swords are shown. If unsuccessful, the attempt is passed to the next player until someone succeeds.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, hearts are totalled, each magic tile being worth 1 heart and the Zelda tile worth 2. The player with the most hearts wins.&#10;&#10;",

It is not for a specific product or release. Versions will appear on the individual item pages.&#10;&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;Killer Bunnies and the Ultimate Odyssey is a new take on the collectible non-collectible KB line, with Jeffrey Neil Bellinger once again putting the rabbits through the grinder. Six new starter decks Animals, Crops, Elementals, Energy, Land and Technology will be available, and players can construct personalized decks of no less than 60 cards, with the cards from any deck.&#10;&#10;When the insatiable appetite of Killer Bunnies game fans demanded more, Playroom looked to Killer Bunnies creator and game designer Jeffrey Neil Bellinger to coordinate the development of, like other games in the Killer Bunnies family, a non-collectible game that can offer variations through different color nick-named deck options. However, this time a new desire expressed by the huge Killer Bunnies fan-base has been fulfilled: Killer Bunnies now has a constructable game variation. Though still not collectible or random, players can now buy starter decks and booster expansions for Killer Bunnies and the Ultimate Odyssey and then use any combination of those cards to form their own constructed decks to play against opponents. Unlike in Killer Bunnies and the Quest for the Magic Carrot, where up to eight players play with the same deck of cards, all sharing the same draw pile, Killer Bunnies and the Ultimate Odyssey has players each draw only from their own constructed deck of 60 cards. There are not any random packs, so players will always know which cards they are purchasing in a deck and they can buy the right products for their planned deck. For Killer Bunnies and the Ultimate Odyssey  six brand new starter decks (red, violet, blue, yellow, green, or orange) allow players to construct a personalized deck with any of the cards of any deck.&#10;&#10;The setting for the new game is an ultimate race to build a bunny society on planet Earth. Killer Bunnies and the Ultimate Odyssey pits players against each other as they struggle to gain Civilization Points, by building cities and increasing their bunny populations. Players gain points by developing their own civilizations or by using zany weapons and hilarious scenarios to destroy their opponents.&#10;&#10;Killer Bunnies and the Ultimate Odyssey is the latest in the family of Killer Bunnies games which features, Killer Bunnies and the Quest for the Magic Carrot, Killer Bunnies and the Quest for the Magic Carrot: Remix, Kinder Bunnies: Their First Adventure and Killer Bunnies and the Journey to Jupiter.&#10;&#10;&#10;In addition to individual starter decks (A-decks) and expansion decks (B-, C-, D- and E-decks), the following products are offered.  Each of the combination decks come with a promo card for each deck included.&#10;&#10;     Heroic and Azoic (Violet, Red, and Blue A-decks)&#10;     Lively and Spry (Green, Orange, and Yellow A-decks)&#10;     Elementals vs. Animals (Violet and Orange A- and B-decks)&#10;     Energy vs. Crops (Red and Green A- and C-decks)&#10;     Technology vs. Land (Blue and Yellow A- and D-decks)&#10;&#10;&#10;Killer Bunnies: Heroes vs. Villains &#226;&#128;&#147; Blue Starter Deck includes (in fact, consists of) the Blue, Green, and Yellow E-decks.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "How many of you remember the old videogames of the '80s &ndash; '90s where you had to be extremely skilled in cabinet to strip completely super-pixelled girls?&#10;&#10;Oppai Go has been created from this idea, a &ldquo;strategic&rdquo; game in which each player has a sexy female alter ego taken on a desert island as a sort of &ldquo;Battle Royale&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Hunger Games&rdquo;, with the exception of only wearing underwear. Unfortunately the fate is not by your side (or maybe yes?), because you will be &ldquo;forced&rdquo; to use every means at your disposal to fully undress your opponents and try to earn your way back home.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to have the most victory points at the end. Players get VP by stripping their opponents of their clothes (or accessories).&#10;&#10;The accessory token moves from one space to another to denote the state of dress of each character. The possible states are as follows:&#10;1. Naked: The accessory token is off the character sheet and the character is flipped to the naked side&#10;2. Pants: The character is only wearing pants (token on pants space)&#10;3. Bra: The character is wearing bra and pants (token on bra space)&#10;4. Armor: The character is wearing bra and pants, and also armor (token on armor space)&#10;5. Weapon: The character has a weapon, armor, bra and panties (token on weapon space)&#10;&#10;The game is divided into rounds, each round is split into phases. Note that some phases are played in clockwise order and some others in anticlockwise order.&#10;&#10;Each player faces a round always with 3 cards in hand, drawing them from the central common deck. Cards could have some effects like removing accessories to an opponent (or to everyone), gain 1 accessory, defend from opposing actions, etc.&#10;&#10;The cards can be played by the hand, can be held (covered) on the table (to be played during the next rounds) or can be discarded. All played cards form a sort of pile in order to activate their effects from the last played card to the first one.&#10;&#10;The held cards go always on the top of the pile, so their effects start first. There's only one problem: the card on the top of the discard pile determines the Seed, that is the color of cards that cannot be played among the held ones.&#10;&#10;This is a game full of funny surprises, bluff, ruthless combos and embarrassing situations.&#10;&#10;",

It is easy to learn and fun for the whole family! Each player is dealt 5 cards and the remaining cards are placed face down in the center of the table to be used as the draw pile. Players should maintain 5 cards in their hand at all times until they hit &ldquo;Top Speed.&rdquo; Players do this by drawing after each turn. At the end of their turn, players must call out their current speed. To start the game, players place a card from their hand on the playing surface in front of them, face up. This is the &ldquo;Speed Pile.&rdquo; Players have their own active speed piles they are trying to increase to 200MPH. Players track their speed using their &ldquo;Speed-O-Meter&rdquo; by adjusting the wheel at the end of each turn. This process is repeated until someone reaches &ldquo;Top Speed,&rdquo; but players must try to avoid the Blow Out, Caution, and Pit Stop cards along the way! Start your engines, you are ready to play!&#10;&#10;",

The interesting part is that there is also a visual component as well.  You can roll a My Play or an All Play category which will play a short movie clip, such as Fried Green Tomatoes, Hannibal, etc. and then ask you questions about the clip, it could be something as simple as how many glasses of water were in the clip to what state did the clip take place, or even who was the actress who played that character's mother.  The game is very fast paced and a lot of fun.  The graphics on the DVD menus and the changes are very nice to watch.  Further, a new &quot;Expansion&quot; DVD is supposed to come out every three months.

    "description": "The Crunch is here! Financial foundations are crumbling, while our nation's cherished traditions of greed, profit and exploitation are threatened.&#10;&#10;As the CEO of a global bank, it's your personal responsibility to do whatever it takes to ensure a comfortable retirement. Call in government bailouts, award yourself bonuses and - when no one's looking - embezzle as much as you can, before it all comes crashing down around you.&#10;&#10;Crunch is a card game for 2 to 4 players that allows you to experience the upside of down. Placed in the role of a global banking CEO, you have to juggle the conflicting demands of your ailing bank and your flourishing bank account.&#10;&#10;Along the way, the game also replicates our modern banking system and foreshadows the inevitable collapse of capitalism, but that's just a bonus.&#10;&#10;It's a Trust Thing&#10;Each player starts the game with a number of Assets in their bank, a small workforce and a few Trust cards. Trust is essential to your bank's survival. Not only will capitalism falter without it, but each Trust card hides on the reverse a potential Government Bailout.&#10;&#10;Government Bailouts can be called in at any time you're feeling the pinch (that's at any time) in return for a variable cash injection. Occasionally though you get nothing, so spend them wisely.&#10;&#10;Debt Makes the World Go Round&#10;Using your workforce, you lend out your bank's Assets as debt. You can dabble in high risk debt for potentially big rewards (and big losses) or stick to the safer (but less profitable) low risk debt. Either way, clever playing of the markets will bring in big returns.&#10;&#10;Bonuses and Embezzling&#10;But then that's all immaterial because what's really important is how much money you can secure for your own personal fortune. You do this by awarding yourself bonuses at regular intervals and by brazenly embezzling your own bank's Assets and hiding them when no one else is looking. If you get caught embezzling, you lose a Trust card and you remember how important Trust is, right?&#10;&#10;Surviving the Crunch&#10;Occasionally, the Crunch will hit and all CEOs have to make sure they can cover all the money they've lent out with the total value of Assets in their banks. If they can't, it's government bailout time or bust. But don't worry too much if that happens because if you've managed to bonus and embezzle enough, you can still win the game, even if you go bankrupt first.&#10;&#10;Remember, you could run a model bank for the entire duration of the game, but if you fail to look after number one, you risk ending up yachtless.&#10;&#10;",

All you need are these rules, a piece of paper (preferably of the graph variety), a pen and a bunch of six sided dice.&#10;&#10;The dungeon is made up of a grid of squares, 9 squares wide and 10 rows deep. There are additional start and end squares in the middle column.&#10;&#10;The objective is to move from the Start square up through the levels of the Dungeon and into the End square where the Big Bad Boss Monster lives and to finally defeat it. Failure to defeat the Big Bad Boss Monster means you have lost.&#10;&#10;Solo Dungeon Bash is a solitaire dungeon crawl. This print-and-play game is available at &#10;http://blackdogofdoom.blogspot.com/2010/09/solo-dungeon-bash.html&#10;&#10;Online version is available at https://games.sprogram.com.ua/en/games/solo-dungeon-bash (free to play)&#10;&#10;",

It is meant to be a feast that will long be remembered!&#10;&#10;The guests attending the feast hall feel the same, for in the corners of the castle deadly plots are being developed. The guests are divided into two factions, with both planning to &quot;dismiss&quot; the king. One faction plans to smuggle a dagger into the feast hall to &quot;open the king's heart to the realm&quot; at the right time, while the other faction hopes to give the king &quot;renewed motivation&quot; with a poisoned drink.&#10;&#10;In The Last Banquet, each player is a guest at the feast and needs to help his faction reach its goal and ensure that this will truly be the king's last banquet. The game includes 25 role cards, each portraying a person on the front and listing that person's skills on the back. In addition to &quot;The Last Banquet&quot;, several other scenarios are provided in the rules that can be played with each of the roles. (GameHeads' Oliver Wolf notes, &quot;Playing time ranges from 30 minutes up to 90 minutes or more, with more people tending to need more time to play.&quot; Also, some scenarios involve more than two factions.) Obstacle cards provide challenges for players to overcome.&#10;&#10;When a faction succeeds in its goal, all players who belong to that faction win the game.&#10;&#10;",

If all positions are occupied without anyone having four in a row, then the game is called a tie.&#10;&#10;A rule that makes it less advantageous to begin is to prohibit the first player from placing his first piece in either a corner position or in one of the eight center positions.&#10;&#10;Similar to:&#10;&#10;    3D Tic Tac Toe - which is played on 3x3x3 grid&#10;    4tec - which is the same game on the 4x4x4 grid also&#10;    Flix - which uses dice to control placement of men on 4x4x4 grid &#10;    Four Letter Words - played on 4x4x4 grid, though with words&#10;    Q4 - which also played on 4x4x4 grid but with only 12 markers&#10;    Tetrano - which is the same game represented on a 4x4 board.&#10;    Qubic - which has a version for 3 players also&#10;    Score Four - 4x4 grid of pegs that are filled from the bottom up&#10;    Dimensions (1970), Hi!Noon: Das Duell (2009), Tic Tac Turn (2011), and X: Die 4.

    "description": "&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Is The Tower of Mystery for You?&#10; The Tower of Mystery is highly competitive and very interactive without being highly strategic!  Everyone's always involved in the game, even when it's not their turn to move their playing piece!  The game is completely different every time you play! Warning:  If a board game needs to be all about strategy, setup, and &quot;the win&quot; in order for you to enjoy it, then you may want to avoid The Tower of Mystery because it's a rapidly changing game that's frequently outside of your complete control.&#10;&#10;But if you enjoy a purely social game that's all about player interaction, fun, laughter, and &quot;the journey&quot;, then chances are great that you'll love the Tower of Mystery!  Social gamers of all ages (adults, college students, teens) and Families enjoy the game!&#10;&#10;The Tower of Mystery contains no occult elements, magic, spells, or evil characters.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Detailed Game Description&#10; The Tower of Mystery combines luck, unpredictability, and a dash of strategy make this an exciting, lively game for everyone. Because up to eight players can play, nobody is left out! It's competitive, interactive, rapidly changing, and fun!Everyone starts in the Garden outside the Tower. Travel around the tower's seven levels, take secret passages, and use staircases, in an attempt to visit each of the four turrets in the tower (in no particular order) and collect a turret token. Once you have all four turret tokens, and have collected Mystery Cards that spell the word &quot;TOWER&quot;, declare your impending win to the other players and then head back to the Garden!  The first person to return to the Garden with Mystery Cards spelling &quot;TOWER&quot; and has a turret token from each of the four turrets, wins the game!&#10;&#10;When playing The Tower of Mystery, you win by constantly adjusting your game-play based on unexpected events.  No matter how masterful you think your plan for winning the game is, it WILL be up-ended by your opponents, and the crazy events that occur within the tower. Your goal is to keep moving towards achieving the game objectives as best you can!  During the game, players move around the seven levels, up and down staircases, and into the four turrets, landing on board spaces where &quot;things happen&quot;. Sometimes a player may get money or lose money, get or lose Mystery Cards, may get to roll the dice and see what happens, might have the chance to swap the location of their playing piece with another player's piece, steal cards or money from other players, or any of many different scenarios and possibilities.&#10;&#10;In addition to the &quot;TOWER&quot; Mystery Cards, there are Mystery Cards that allow you to do nice things to yourself, or try to stop your opponents.  There are several ways to collect Mystery Cards. Some ways are free, others cost money. The fastest but most risky way to collect free Mystery Cards is to stay in a turrent for multiple turns. However, while in a turret, a player is vulnerable because they cannot play any Mystery Cards. Players can collect up to 3 free Mystery Cards per turn while in a turret so even though it's risky to stay in a turret for very long, there's definitely a benefit to visiting the turrets even though playing Mystery Cards there is a no-no.&#10;&#10;Players can play any number of Mystery Cards on any other players (or themselves) even when it's not their turn! This can cause &quot;mayhem&quot; when several players suddenly jump into the action at the same time!  You will have to alter your plans over and over in order to stay ahead of your opponents!  Almost constant player interaction keeps everyone on their toes, all the while laughing and having fun every step of the way!&#10;&#10;At the end of each turn that a player's piece is in a turret, they must draw a Turret Card. Turret Cards might affect only the player drawing the card, might affect everyone in the game, or several players but not all.  One thing is for sure: Turret Cards often dramatically change the game for everyone in an instant! Some Turret Cards are helpful, but most of them cause unexpected, often funny events to happen to some or all of the players in the game!&#10;&#10;While money is a component of the game, it has no bearing on winning the game! Tower Bucks are used to buy Mystery Cards and pay penalties. Being broke is risky, because if a player is completely broke and they have to pay a fine to the bank or a penalty to another player, they lose three turns!  Hoarding money serves no purpose, however, so each player has to decide how much money is enough to keep and how much is safe to spend.&#10;&#10;The Tower of Mystery is a great Party Game for all ages! Adults young and old enjoy playing The Tower of Mystery when together for their regular social Game Night. Families enjoy it for Family Game Night because it's equally playable for both the kids and the parents. It is suitable for children as young as about eight as long as they are able to read the cards and know the best time to play their cards. Teens enjoy The Tower of Mystery because it's so unpredictable and lively.  Even retired yacht club ladies have been known to give up their Friday afternoon dominoes to play The Tower of Mystery!  If you enjoy great player interaction, surprises, laughter and fun, then the Tower of Mystery is the game for you!&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Chicken of the Sea is a game included in issue #3 of GameFix magazine.  It's a wargame simulation of the battle of Drepanum, 249 BC (Rome vs Carthage).  The title comes from a rather audacious act of the Roman admiral, Claudius the Handsome.  He was told by the official augurs that the portents were not good for a naval battle: &quot;the sacred chickens will not eat.&quot;  Claudius threw the sacred chickens into the sea, saying &quot;then let them drink.&quot;&#10;&#10;The game comes with 100 counters representing both ships and informational counters, an 11&quot; x 17&quot; map (28x43 cm), and eight pages of illustrated rules with sidebars.  A small game by wargame standards.&#10;&#10;The basic sequence is mutual assignment of speed to galleys, Carthaginian ships move then board, and finally Roman ships move then board.  Facing is important, ramming, fouling other ships and shearing oars are all possible.  Melee fighting is common.  There are optional command/control/formation rules.&#10;&#10;All in all, fairly low complexity as wargame simulations go.&#10;&#10;",

Play dominoes on their corresponding spaces on the game board. As you complete squares, you conquer territories and claim them as your own. Dominate the game board and you win! For ages 8 and up.&#10;&#10;From a review in &quot;Games Quarterly&quot;, Winter 2005:&#10;&#10;The Domination board is a seven-by-seven grid of squares with sets of numbers that resemble half a domino at each corner. Each player starts with seven dominoes. When it's your turn, you lay down a domino along one edge of a square so that the numbers on both corners match your domino. Then you draw another domino.&#10;&#10;If your play closes off the fourth side of a square, you put a poker chip in the center of that square to claim it. You keep playing until all the dominoes are used, which fills up the entire board. At that point, the player with the most chips on the board wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

The battle field has a grid (not hex) pattern.  The Thermopylae pass was very narrow (20 meters at the narrowest point), so unit deployment is the essential mechanic instead of side ranging maneuvers.&#10;&#10;Although this is primarily a solitaire game, there are minor rule changes provided for two-player play (Greek and Persian sides), and even a three-player option (commanding different contingents of the Greek force).&#10;&#10;",

If you want to relive the best moments of the film (if you suffer a horrible death you consider a good time), then The Creature is your game.&#10;&#10;The Creature is a competitive card game in which you will all have to fight against all to escape with life from the scientific base in which you are locked together with an Being from Another World known as The Creature.&#10;&#10;In this hidden role-playing game you will not have friends, because anyone can be infected. The only thing that matters is to survive and to escape in the only available place of the rescue helicopter ... although that supposes to finish with your companions.&#10;&#10;The Creature is a card game for 3 to 10 players in which no one is who they seem to be and where paranoia reigns throughout the game. Use your event cards to beat your teammates, vote against them to sedate them, collect weapons for the final showdown and try to prevent The Creature from taking over your body. Does it feel like little stress? Then wait for the helicopter to land and you have to fight everyone to occupy the only seat.&#10;&#10;A game of The Creature lasts from 30 minutes to an hour, depending on the number of players.&#10;&#10;The game is not recommended for children under 13, we do not want children to become accustomed to crushing their friends.&#10;&#10;The objective of the game is to escape from the research base on the helicopter. The bad thing is that there is only one place for a scientist, so only one of the players can escape the horror. Will it be a human who gets on the helicopter, one of the infected scientists or the creature itself?&#10;&#10;The helicopter will arrive when all the turns of game are finished. There are as many turns in a game as participating players minus one, which are controlled in the time marker with the clock tab. The minimum number of turns to play is 2, and the maximum 10. This represents the difficulty or ease of the creature to infect scientists when the group is more or less numerous.&#10;&#10;It can neutralize the Creature so that it does not continue to infect the scientists, sedating it twice (the first time the silk manages to escape).&#10;&#10;The scientist who escapes in the helicopter wins the game, even if it is the creature or one of the infected will mean the end of humanity ...&#10;&#10;Overview.&#10;&#10;The game is divided into turns, and there are as many turns as players are present in the game minus one (maximum 10 turns), plus the final turn of the game, the helicopter phase where everyone fights against everyone to sit in the available seat and Escape from base. Each turn is divided into three phases:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Event Phase&#10;     Voting phase&#10;     Movement phase&#10;&#10;&#10;During the events phase players put their event cards into action to produce effects during the game.&#10;&#10;In the voting phase players use their voting to decide which scientist they will sedate.&#10;&#10;The movement phase is played after the voting, and in it all players deliver their character cards (including that of The Creature) to the boss, who shuffles them and re-allocates them among the players, in such a way that the Creature moves from one scientist to another, infecting them.&#10;&#10;The objective of the game is to escape in the helicopter. Players who have had the creature's card at some point become infected, and therefore will try to help the creature carry out its plans, complicating the existence of other players who are still human. The bad thing is that there will be moments during the game in which no one will know who is who, further sowing chaos in the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Champion of Earth is an easy to learn, quick-play card game where the players defend the Earth from an alien invasion.&#10;&#10;It has both both a co-operative and a competitive element because, while you want to defeat the invasion, the winner will be the one with the most enemy kills.&#10;&#10;The deck consists of three types of cards: Player cards (which track your character's status), Monster cards (which represent the invaders) and Equipment cards (which represent the equipment the characters may use to defeat the Monsters).&#10;&#10;The players take equipment and must match or exceed the power level of the invaders by playing that equipment. Many of the invaders have special abilities, and so does much of the equipment - these are listed on the cards where relevant.&#10;&#10;During a player's turn, they choose between 1 and 3 equipment cards to draw and the same number of invaders are drawn and placed face down. The player then chooses how many of the invaders they wish to fight. That number of cards is turned over, beginning from the first card dealt. The player must then play Equipment on the Monster cards to defeat them and claim the corpses.&#10;&#10;If they succeed in defeating the enemies, they chose to fight, it becomes the next player's turn. If they fail, they become Injured. If they are injured a second time, they die.&#10;&#10;Even dead, a player can win - the victory condition is defeating the invasion and having the most enemy kills - you can be the Champion of Earth posthumously!&#10;&#10;",
