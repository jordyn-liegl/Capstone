Lang.&#10;&#10;In this game, each player fields one of the superhero teams, with each hero &mdash; Batman, Wonder Woman, Hal Jordan, Mogo, Superboy Prime, Sinestro and more &mdash; being represented by custom-tooled dice; each team must be composed of 15 dice, and a player can &quot;purchase&quot; dice only from his team. Each hero also has one or more character reference cards, which show the special abilities for the characters based on the die rolls. Different versions of these cards are available in booster packs, allowing for more customization of your team. Players use these dice to collect energy, recruit new heroes, and battle head-to-head. In addition, each player brings two basic action cards to the game, which are placed in the center of the table; both players can purchase these cards. A player wins once the opposing player has been reduced to zero life.&#10;&#10;DC Comics Dice Masters: War of Light debuts both the Teen Titans and new Lantern Corps never before seen in Dice Masters! With gameplay that supports two players in epic dice battles, DC Comics Dice Masters: War of Light lets players build their own team of heroes or villains!&#10;&#10;",

Junta: &iexcl;Viva el Presidente! continues this idea.&#10;&#10;Several years have passed since the island was afflicted by unrest and attempted putsches. Since then, the army has lost importance; in its place, private militias do the dirty work. The members of the Junta live a reclusive life in grandiose estates financed by their Swiss bank accounts. The players belong to this Junta and now command their own private militias. And, as before, they rob their opponents unscrupulously and ambush the president as often as they can in order to become president themselves. The players must pocket as much development aid as possible, use this to hire new militias and extend their estates. The player who does this the fastest wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

The famous Dr. van Helsing got wind of Dracula's plans and immediately caught the next carriage to London. It is a race against time! Van Helsing tries to find and destroy all of the vampire's coffins, while the count tries to find five victims. Will the horror end tonight or will the count's reign of terror continue?&#10;&#10;Dracula is part of the Kosmos two-player series.&#10;&#10;Dracula is a two player game hand management/memory game. One player takes the role of Professor Van Helsing, the other player is Dracula. Van Helsing is trying to locate and destroy Dracula's coffins whilst Dracula is attempting to find victims that he can turn in to vampires.&#10;&#10;Each player has a deck of cards which they place face-down on the board. These cards contain the coffins/victims that they other player must find to win. They also contain minions, helpers and traps that can harm or distract the other player. Players can also place coloured barriers to obstruct their opponent's progress.&#10;&#10;Players move their pieces by playing from a second hand of action cards. Each action card contains an ability and a distance to be moved. When a player ends their move they reveal the card that their piece has landed on and (if it is one of their own) replace it with a new card. By a process of elimination and deduction they are trying to find their target cards before their health is worn down to zero by their opponent's traps.&#10;&#10;",

To win, push, flick or judo-chop your pucks so they are closest to the central jack at the end of the round. Sound simple? Well, it is! Find any smooth surface (tables are ideal, and luckily most people have them), whip out your Push It bag, and play with whoever is up to the challenge. The game is quick to learn but hard to master. Come up against a Push It maestro and you&rsquo;ll soon be put in your place (Warning: friendships can suffer as direct result of Push It). Play Push It either mano-a-mano, 3 player, 4 player or our favourite and most strategic version is two teams of two.&#10;&#10;At Push It we want you to unleash your creativity, so there are no long-winded rules or measuring; players have to argue amongst themselves to agree whose puck is closest, or else a &lsquo;Push Off&rsquo; tie-break round decides. Only you can tell if that was really &lsquo;cheek lifting&rsquo; and not &lsquo;bum shuffling&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s all about having your own house rules, playing on different surfaces like car bonnets or pizza trays (tried and tested) and WINNING. So when the pressure is on and you&rsquo;re going for that extra point (without knocking your opponent&rsquo;s puck closer), try to remember &ndash; it&rsquo;s just for fun!!&#10;&#10;",

After being dealt a hand of cards, the players choose from various characters (such as King or Gambler) that change how they will participate in the game.&#10;&#10;The basic game consists of three rounds of trick-taking, and the winner will be the person that wins the most tricks in two of the three rounds.  Alternatively, if no one achieves that condition, if a player has taken no tricks in all three rounds, they will be the winner.&#10;&#10;Not mentioned above, the game also has a higher priority victory condition and a lower one.

The characters also give the players ways to earn points, and this is the lowest tier of victory determination: who has the most points.&#10;&#10;To illustrate some of the character abilities, the Gambler can discard cards from the initial hand to draw replacements, and will bid for how many tricks they take, possibly granting them extra points if successful. The Resistance has the potential to cause a &quot;revolution&quot; which reverses the strength of the ranks, and earns more points if they can win tricks with what would normally be the &quot;high&quot; cards.&#10;&#10;",

Noah himself stands on one ferry. On a turn, a player plays one card from hand onto the ferry where Noah is located, following two rules: (1) the total weight of all animals on board cannot exceed 21 and (2) animals on a ferry must be placed either in alternating gender order or must be all of the same gender. After placing an animal, the player moves Noah to a different ferry; if he played a female animal, Noah goes to either adjacent ferry, while if he played a male, Noah goes to either ferry on the other side of the circle.&#10;&#10;If a player can't legally play an animal, he must first take in hand all the animals on the ferry where Noah is located, then play an animal.&#10;&#10;In addition to moving Noah to a nearly full ferry, players have two other ways to benefit themselves or mess with other players. If a player plays an animal of the same species as the one last played on that ferry (regardless of gender), he moves Noah, then takes another turn. If a player brings the weight of a ferry to exactly 21, that ferry launches from shore to meet the ark located in distant waters, a new ferry becomes available for loading, and the player distributes 1&ndash;4 cards from his hand among his opponents. finally, some cards have special animals, such as the giraffe that lets you peek at an opponent's hand and the woodpecker, which stupidly pokes holes in the ferry and reduces its maximum weight to 13. Bad woodpecker, bad!&#10;&#10;The round ends when a player runs out of cards in hand or a fourth ferry launches. Players receive penalty points for cards still in hand, scored according to the number of tears on each card, those tears representing Noah's sadness at the animal being left behind. Then players shuffle all the animal cards and begin a new round. The player with the fewest points after three rounds wins!&#10;&#10;",

You can get bonuses on your actions by gaining Corruption, but the game will periodically penalize the most corrupt players, and everyone loses VP for Corruption at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;You'll perform all your actions &mdash; like collecting resources, constructing buildings, and repaying favors &mdash; on a one-way track. Like other one-way track games, you can go as far as you'd like, but you'll only get another turn when everyone else passes you. You gain 1 VP per floor for each building you construct. Tenants offer powerful actions that change each game. You can collect a tenant power by landing on its space or constructing a building on its card.&#10;&#10;The round ends after everyone makes a lap around the one-way track. Players score bonus points for tallest buildings in each neighborhood and the game. You'll play 2 rounds in the Standard Game (about 90-120 minutes for 3-4 players) and 3 rounds (about 2.5 hours) in the Full game. After the appropriate number of rounds, players lose points for Corruption, and the player with most VP wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

If the beam strikes a non-mirrored surface on almost any piece, that piece is removed from play. (One exception: The defenders have one surface immune from laser fire, which means you can use them to protect your king; they're vulnerable to laser fire from other directions, though.)&#10;&#10;When a king is hit by a laser, the other player wins the game!

    "description": "Fist of Dragonstones is a closed-fist, bidding game. Players try to outwit their opponents by using gold and magic coins to buy control of an ever-changing cast of enchanted character cards. Those characters' powers collect valuable Dragonstones; lend their magical powers; help foil other players, and convert Dragonstones into victory.&#10;For each character card, players choose the number of coins they want to bid by placing them in a closed fist. All players reveal their bets at the same time with the winner of the auction then gaining control of the card's powers. Depending on the card they may: win additional coins or Dragonstones; place spells on other players; or win scoring points.&#10;&#10;The Legend : &#10;Many, many years ago, an enchanted forest lay hidden between two great mountain ranges. The forest valley was home to several kingdoms whose rival princes battled with each other to unite the entire realm under one flag. To gain advantage, princes vied with each other to collect powerful magic amulets called Dragonstones.&#10;Like many royals, over time the princes began to prefer the comfort and safety of their fortified castles. Rather than risk their own lives by venturing out to search for these amulets, they paid handsome rewards to those who could bring them stones. The allure of the princes' wealth soon filled the enchanted forest with all manner of wizards, witches, dwarves, goblins, and many other enchanted creatures - all in pursuit of the magic Dragonstones.&#10;&#10;This enchanted land is now almost entirely lost to legend. Yet, at a cozy inn, in a small forgotten village, the memory of Dragonstones is kept alive by the inn's ancient proprietor. Even today, a nod from a knowing traveler may persuade him to recount some of the ancient tales. And if he takes a particular liking to you, he may bring out his own collection of magic stones, and challenge you to a simple game of luck and skill and a chance to grab your own Dragonstones!&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "TECH? NO! &#10;Forget about expensive game systems, emulators, disconnected online games, and high-priced yearly roster updates. TECHNO BOWL takes everything you love about arcade and video game football classics like Tecmo Bowl, NFL Blitz, and Madden and puts it all on the tabletop.&#10;&#10;1UP&#10;And as if that isn&rsquo;t cool enough, it also gives you a feature that gamers have long asked for but never gotten&hellip; until now! What is it you ask? As a coach in TECHNO BOWL, you will design your own formations and plays. That&rsquo;s right. Let me say it again. You get to design your own formations and plays.&#10;&#10;And I&rsquo;m not talking about choosing several formation cards, lining up elements on a chart, or utilizing some other abstraction. This is putting the power to effortlessly create real football formations and plays into your hands.&#10;&#10;ZERO DOWN TIME&#10;Thanks to the BOX SPORTS ENGINE, there is almost zero down time in the game [except for half time and timeouts of course!]. Coaches are constantly involved, and the on-field players are always interacting with one another as skill checks and ever evolving plays result in: free actions, reactions, read-and-reacts, and offensive and defensive adjustments. Add to that real world timers for setting up formations and selecting plays, and you have a truly dynamic fast-paced tabletop football experience.&#10;&#10;UNPARALLELED FOOTBALL GAMEPLAY&#10;TECHNO BOWL delivers that authentic football feel like no game before it. Establish the running game by punching it in between the tackles or tossing it to a back for an outside sweep. Launch an air offensive while sitting in the pocket or throwing on the run with laser accurate throws directly to the receiver or exciting route passes where you lead the receiver in hopes of beating the coverage. Defense can run man, zone, and mixed defensive packages and bring the blitz. Oh, can it bring the blitz!&#10;&#10;No matter which strategy you choose, the gameplay will look, feel, and flow like a real football play.&#10;&#10;OPTIONS&#10;TECHNO BOWL is all about options, and there&rsquo;s a game mode, team, and play style for everyone. You even have the option to run an option!&#10;&#10;MODES&#10;There are five different modes of play. Each of these brings a different experience to the table.&#10;&#10;- TECHNO is 7-vs-7 with no skills and no field goals.&#10;- ALL TECHNO is 7-vs-7 with skills but no field goals.&#10;- INFERNO! It&rsquo;s ALL TECHNO with more awesome and fire! [more later]&#10;- PRO is 8-vs-8 with no skills but includes field goal rules.&#10;- ALL PRO is 8-vs-8 with skills and field goal rules.&#10;&#10;Each of these modes offers a completely different game experience, and I know what you&rsquo;re thinking. How does adding an extra couple of players to the field [and the ability to kick field goals] equate with an entirely different mode? Trust me. Having that extra player on both sides of the ball quite literally changes everything.&#10;&#10;MAD SKILLS&#10;When playing in modes that utilize special skills and abilities, coaches will have access to three types of players:&#10;&#10;- IMPACT&#10;- STAR&#10;- SUPERSTAR&#10;&#10;These players will come equipped with one or more of the 26 skills found in the game. That count of 26 skills doesn&rsquo;t even include core fundamentals or INFERNO MODE specific skills.&#10;&#10;SKILL&#10;Speaking of skills, TECHNO BOWL is a game of skill and not a random &lsquo;dice fest&rsquo;. The 2d6 rolls used for skill checks mean that coaches won&rsquo;t fall prey to straight-line probabilities or random chaos. Winning is about getting the right match and modifiers to deliver a high percentage roll, having a plan when you get an unusually poor result, and knowing the right time to make a high risk roll for a shot at a very high payoff. Of course, your formations, play calling, and player positioning create these opportunities.&#10;&#10;PLAYMAKER DIE&#10;The PLAYMAKER die powers some of the special skills in the game like stiff arms and spin moves allowing for sophisticated passive abilities to be triggered without the need for complex rules.&#10;&#10;TEAMS&#10;There are 32 teams in the MORE FUN LEAGUE [MFL], and each of these has its own unique play style. This means that you&rsquo;re not just trying to get into the head of the coach that&rsquo;s sitting across the table from you, but that you have to take into consideration the strengths and weaknesses of the players on the specific rosters that you and your opponent are using.&#10;&#10;PLAYER SKILL RATINGS&#10;The player skill rating system ensures that coaches and spectators will know how well or poorly a player performs fundamental actions by simply looking at the jersey number! No need to look at charts or extended stat lines. The league skill cap manages team composition so that you are never taxed to remember an insane number of special abilities or which players have them. Coaches get beaten by other coaches and NOT the rules.&#10;&#10;Welcome to the More Fun League!&#10;&#10;",

A set of simple mechanisms form the basis of 1824 Austria-Hungary.&#10;&#10;You use the yellow, green, brown and gray tiles to create a rail network on the map. Just as in a real railway business, the track in the game connects railway stations to each other. The trains (train cards) make notional journeys from one station to the next and thereby earn money. The (imaginary) passengers pay for their journeys. The more numerous and the more important the stations on a train's journey are, the more money it earns for the company and its shareholders.&#10;&#10;In the game you and your fellow players can own up to 6 Mountain Railways, 4 Coal Railways, 7 forerunners of the National Railways, as well as shares in 3 National Railways and 5 Regional Railways. The Major Companies (the National and Regional Railways) belong to their shareholders. The player with the most shares in the company is the Director of that company and decides how the company will act.&#10;&#10;This game is a further streamlined version of the self-published 1824 from 2005.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Beset on all sides by hostile aliens and threatened from within by traitors, Humanity&rsquo;s only chance for survival rests with the continuation of the cruel and bloody regime known as the Imperium. Yet few among Mankind&rsquo;s untold population realise the full truth of their situation. If there is any future at all, it is a grim one&hellip;&#10;&#10;The Book&#10;&#10;A 280-page hardback, this is the essential book for any fan of Warhammer 40,000 &ndash; everything you need to know to collect, build, paint and play with Citadel miniatures.&#10;&#10;Rules&#10;&#10;The Core Rules explain everything you need to play to play Warhammer 40,000. Moving, shooting, using psychic powers, charging, fighting and morale tests are covered, giving you the basic framework to play with. You can play a game using only these 8 pages, bolting on more advanced and complex rules when you and your opponent are ready.&#10;&#10;Three Ways to Play&#10;&#10;&#10;     Open Play &ndash; pick some models, put them on the table and begin a game. This is the most flexible approach, designed with near-limitless possibilities; all you need is some models, their datasheets and the core rules. Included are some themes and ideas you can use or build upon to add atmosphere to your games, and 3 example missions.&#10;     Narrative Play &ndash; Warhammer 40,000 has a vast, rich history with countless epic battles. Narrative Play is designed to let you and your friends re-enact those battles at your leisure. There are special rules to help you do this, such as Concealed Deployment and unpredictable, random battle lengths, and the book includes several missions * 6 Crucible of War missions and 1 Echoes of War mission, each showing you how to play in this style.&#10;     Matched Play &ndash; for many players, Warhammer 40,000 is an opportunity to prove their mettle with tactics and strategy, an exercise in out-thinking and out-gunning their opponent with balanced, equal armies: Matched Play is for them. There are several ways to ensure that your forces are balanced against each other &ndash; a points limit is the typical way, but the system is flexible enough to allow armies based on unit numbers, Power Ratings, Wounds; as long as your limits are agreed, the possibilities are manifold. This book provides details on choosing your armies, and provides missions as examples of the tactical challenges available: 6 Eternal War and 6 Maelstrom of War missions, with explanations covering the use of Tactical Objectives.&#10;&#10;&#10;Advanced Rules&#10;&#10;While the Core Rules provide with you with everything needed to play, the Advanced Rules are a selection of rules and expansions that can be used to play with your miniatures the way that you want to. With these rules, there are always new challenges to face, new battles to fight, and new ways to play:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Battle-Forged Armies: organise your models in a way that reflects the armies of Warhammer 40,000 &ndash; this places restrictions on your army, but makes up for it with powerful benefits, which use a system of Command Points;&#10;     Battlefield Terrain: rules for a variety of terrains (Woods, Ruins, Barricades, Obstacles, Imperial Statuary, Fuel Pipes, Battlescape and Hills), each of which introduce scenarios and opportunities that change the nature of battle;&#10;     Battlezones: rules for fighting amidst the effects of otherworldly environments, including low visibility, beneath an apocalyptic orbital battle and in the middle of a devastating psychic maelstrom;&#10;     Planetstrike: slam down from orbit in a terrifying planetary assault. Two players are separated into Attacker and Defender, with scenarios that play out a full incursion and a Planetfall mission;&#10;     Cities of Death: street fighting in the ruins of a shattered city, with buildings bitterly fought over &ndash; the claustrophobia of urban warfare makes for tense battles with snipers and grenades coming to the fore. Includes a Firesweep mission for playing out room-to-room combat;&#10;     Stronghold Assault: dig in for a game of fortified siege warfare. One player seeks to overwhelm the prepared defences of another, with a Bunker Assault mission included;&#10;     Death From the Skies: dogfighting for your Flyer models, allowing the recreation of epic clashes above the battlefield. A Tactical Strike mission involves a defence against a bombing run;&#10;     Multiplayer Battles: rules accommodating three (or more!) players, with an example of a multiplayer battle to work from;&#10;     Campaigns: an overview of linking your games into Tree, Matrix and Map campaigns.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Copenhagen: Roll &amp; Write features gameplay similar to the Copenhagen board game, but with players now finishing the facade of their building thanks to the colors shown on rolled dice, not drafted and played cards.&#10;&#10;In the game, each player has a paper scoresheet that shows a building and five colored lines of boxes. A sheet in the center of the playing area shows various polyomino tiles in those same five colors, with tiles of two and three spaces on one side of a central divider and tiles of four and five spaces on the other side. The game includes five six-sided dice that feature the above mentioned five colors on five of their sides as well as a sixth color that serves as a joker. Each player starts with two red stars on their scoresheet; you can spend one of these stars on your turn to reroll as many dice as you wish.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you roll the five dice. If you have rerolls in reserve, you can use them if you wish. You then choose a group of dice in a single color, then you see the shape of the polyomino that corresponds to this choice, then you draw that polyomino on the facade of the building, with the polyomino needing to &quot;rest&quot; on the bottom of the building area. One space in this polyomino is brick (represented by an &quot;X&quot;) while the other spaces are all windows (represented by an &quot;O&quot;). If you created a polyomino of four or five spaces, you cross it off the central sheet of paper as each tile shown on the right side of the sheet can be used only once.&#10;&#10;Each other player then gets to choose one of the dice that you didn't use to claim that polyomino, then fill in the leftmost empty box of that color on their scoresheet. These boxes might have a symbol underneath them. If the box has a + under it, then this player can cross off the + on a future turn to add one &quot;phantom&quot; die showing this color to whatever they rolled that round, e.g., if you cross off a blue +, you effectively rolled three blue dice that turn instead of two. If a box has a star under it, then you can cross out that star on a future turn to use the power of that color:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Red lets you reroll as many dice as you want.&#10;    Blue lets you change one brick space to a window space when you're drawing something into your facade.&#10;    Purple lets you draw one brick space in an empty space of your choice (as long as this space isn't floating in air).&#10;    Green lets you change all dice of one color to another color of your choice.&#10;    Yellow lets you use a polyomino shape that was crossed out on a previous turn.&#10;&#10;&#10;You can use as many stars as you wish on your turn.&#10;&#10;When you fill in a horizontal row in the facade of your building, you score 2 points if all the spaces are filled with windows and 1 point if at least one space holds brick; when you fill in a vertical column, you score 4 points and 2 points under the same condition. When you fill in predesignated rows and columns, you receive an immediate bonus &mdash; either drawing one window in an empty space or crossing off two boxes in one or two color lines on your scoresheet. If you cross out the final space in a color line, you score 2 points.&#10;&#10;Gameplay continues until someone has scored 12 or more points. Complete the round so that each player has had the same number of turns, then whoever has the most points wins!&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Long ago, a splendid streak of crimson fell from the sky and carved the valley from the earth. The foliage that the light touched grew wild and fierce, and the wildlife grew larger and more fearsome. Life prospered in the vale.&#10;&#10;From distant lands, members of many cultures converged, drawn by the mystery and allure of the red star and the verdant realm it created. They settled there, distancing themselves at first. The soil was hearty, perfect for crops; the rock was rich with mineral deposits begging to be mined, and the very land itself seemed eager to be shaped.&#10;&#10;On warm summer nights, the velvet sky became streaked with the scarlet light of meteor showers. The settlers found that, under these lights, their crafting projects finished more quickly and with greater results! Before long, the people began to co-operate, sharing their wares and knowledge with one another.&#10;&#10;Together under an evening meteor shower, they founded a shared township &mdash; one that valued knowledge and craft. The township was named Splendence after the valley that brought them all together.&#10;&#10;In the centuries that followed, a red substance the people named material could be found after meteor showers. Artisans learned to craft using the substance, which lent magical qualities to their works. These works, called Artifice, were established which would catapult the township into an industrial revolution.&#10;&#10;The Artisans of Splendent Vale is a cooperative adventure game set in a magical and unique land. As a troupe of artisans, you will explore the beauty of the Splendent Vale while honing your individual crafts. Overcome challenges during tactical action scenes played out on specialized grid maps, then experience individual interludes to build your story, separately from the group&rsquo;s tale. Teamwork and careful strategy will be crucial during these encounters.&#10;&#10;",

NVA expertise in lure and ambush tactics resulted in significant US casualties. US mobility and the ability to bring massive amounts of firepower to bear quickly virtually destroyed the attacking NVA division and forced a change in NVA tactics.&#10;&#10;This re-issue of GMT Games' 1990 CSR Award winning title that started it all keeps the original operational system, but streamlines to it to include innovative combat resolution integrating maneuver combat, close assault, artillery bombardment, and support from gunships and air sorties.&#10;&#10;Increased accessibility to primary and secondary source material has made it possible to make changes to more accurately represent both sides' unique capabilities without significantly altering or breaking the base game system. The major changes involve patrols, ambushes, landing zones, and the 1st Cav Brigade HQ, while minor changes tweak movement, combat, and coordination game mechanics to showcase radically different strengths and weaknesses the FWA and NVA force brought to the battles in the Ia Drang Valley.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Between them lay the vast, undeveloped interior. It would be a nation-defining project, opening up the resource-rich Canadian shield, the fertile prairies, and the breathtaking Rocky Mountain Cordillera, shaping not only the economy of the young country but its identity as well.&#10;&#10;The Transcontinental is a medium-weight Eurogame with worker-placement and pick-up and deliver mechanisms about the development of the Canadian transcontinental railway.&#10;&#10;Players are contractors who work to complete the railway. They send out telegrams along a linear worker-placement track &mdash; reserving those action spaces for themselves &mdash; then take turns in telegram order, loading and unloading to a shared train that travels across the country. Players can use these resources to complete developments ranging from lumber mills and farms to cities and national parks, or they can use the resources to bid to extend the railway. Powerful one-time-use ally cards, themed around a rich and inclusive cast of Canadian historical figures, allow players to make powerful combined actions.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

In Junk Orbit, you're captain of your own scavenger ship, picking up space junk and transporting it to any city that will take it. Launch your junk ... uh, *cargo* ... out of your airlock to propel your ship! Race to deliver your cargo as you navigate the orbits of nearby planets and moons! It's astrodynamics for fun and profit! On your turn, carry out these three steps:&#10;&#10;1. Launch junk &mdash; Choose any one junk tile in your cargo hold and move it away from your ship (clockwise or counter-clockwise, your choice) a number of spaces equal to its numeric value. If it reaches its destination city this way, you have made a remote delivery. Otherwise, it simply comes to rest after moving its full distance. It is also possible to hit an enemy ship with launched junk, causing that opponent to discard one junk tile from their cargo.&#10;&#10;2. Move ship &mdash; Your ship must now move the same distance that your launched junk did, but in the opposite direction. When your ship reaches a transfer point between location boards, you may choose to switch orbits. If you do, your ship changes direction (from clockwise to counter-clockwise, or vice versa) as it enters the new orbit. If the space your ship lands on is the destination of any junk in your cargo, you have made a direct delivery.&#10;&#10;3. Pick up junk &mdash; After moving your ship, pick up all junk tiles present in your current city, adding them to your cargo hold. Then, refill your current city with one new junk tile from the corresponding stack (e.g., if at a Mars city, refill from the Mars stack).&#10;&#10;Each player has their own ship with a unique ship power that breaks the rules above in some way. The end of the game is triggered when a city cannot be refilled because its stack is empty. When this happens, every player gets one final turn, then players tally the values from all of their delivered junk tiles, and whoever has the highest total wins.&#10;&#10;",

The seven actions include two introductory scenarios, a cavalry raid, a fighting withdrawal, a series of operational maneuvers through mountainous terrain, and two large battles:&#10;    -McLemore&rsquo;s Cove (4 turns, September 10-13, 1863)&#10;    -Crossing Chickamauga Creek (1 turn, September 18, 1863)&#10;    -The Battle of Chickamauga (3 turns, September 18-20, 1863)&#10;    -Wheeler&rsquo;s Raid (8 turns, September 29-October 6, 1863)&#10;    -Opening the Cracker Line (1 turn, October 28, 1863)&#10;    -Lookout Mountain &amp; Missionary Ridge (2 turns, November 24-25, 1863)&#10;    -Ringgold Gap (2 turns, November 26-27, 1863)&#10;&#10;The two Advanced Game scenarios cover both major periods of campaigning in the region:&#10;    -The Chickamauga Campaign (32 turns, August 29- September 29, 1863)&#10;    -The Siege of Chattanooga (40 turns, October 28-December 6, 1863)&#10;&#10;The Advanced Game rule set has also been standardized so players will be able to quickly move to new campaigns in the series.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Turn: 1 day&#10;Hex: 2000 yards / 1.15 mile&#10;Unit: Regiment to Division&#10;&#10;Battle Above the Clouds contains:&#10;    -GCACW Series Rules Booklet (approx 24 pgs)&#10;    -BATC Specific Rules Booklet (approx 48 pgs including scenarios/designer notes)&#10;    -Two 22&quot;x32&quot; full-color mapsheets&#10;    -A full-color 11&quot;x17&quot; Off-Map Display&#10;    -Two full-color Force Displays&#10;    -Three Countersheets&#10;    -Two 4-page color Charts and Tables&#10;    -Two 6-sided Dice&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "In 1887, a vampire wakes up and seeks to quench his thirst for blood. Brave men and women ally to destroy him &ndash; but to do so, they will have to thwart the plot of Renfield, his faithful servant.&#10;&#10;Nosferatu is a card game mixing tactics, bluffing, and team play, with the vampire and Renfield facing off against the vampire hunters. At the start of the game, everyone knows who Renfeld is, and Renfield knows which of the hunters is actually a vampire (as he chooses how to distribute the character cards), but the vampire's identity is hidden from everyone else. The hunters must identify the vampire and kill him with the ancestral stake before he can play five bite cards; if the hunters accidentally stake one of their own, then demoralized and weakened they lose the game.&#10;&#10;Each player other than Renfield starts with two cards from the library, which is comprised of rumors, incantations, bites and night cards. Five ritual cards &ndash; silver mirror, 2x blood transfusion, holy water and time distortion &ndash; are placed face-up on the table. Renfield creates a &quot;clock&quot; by taking one night card for each player and shuffling it with a dawn card.&#10;&#10;The game lasts a number of rounds, with the rounds continuing until one of the winning conditions is met. At the start of a round, players take turns doing the following: Drawing two cards from the library, discarding one card face-up, placing one card face-down in an action pile, then drawing a card from the clock. As soon as a player draws the dawn card or each player has played once, this part of the round ends.&#10;&#10;Renfield shuffles all the cards in the action pile, then reveals them. If the pile contains only incantations, the player holding the stake chooses one of the rituals, takes its action, then turns the ritual face-down. Once all five rituals have been used, the hunters win the game, but their main goal is to kill the vampire. If the deck contains bite cards, then Renfield applies the bites to the hunters, with a hunter losing one card in his stock for each bite; a hunter can have at most two bites. Night cards in the pile are added to the clock, thereby giving the vampire more time to work in future rounds, while making it tougher for players to achieve rituals.&#10;&#10;If the dawn card was revealed, the holder of the ancient stake can stab someone, thereby ending the game with victory for one side or the other, or pass the stake to another player. (If dawn didn't break, then the stake passes to another player with no opportunity for stabbing.)&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Alcatraz: The Scapegoat is a game about conflicted loyalties. On one hand, the players work together to bust out of the famous prison; on the other hand they all know that one of them will be left behind as the scapegoat.&#10;&#10;Alcatraz is a peculiar game because while it is cooperative in some aspects, with players needing to work together to complete tasks, the game has loads of negative interaction as one player will always be the scapegoat. You don't want to be that guy. You don't &quot;go all in,&quot; you don't always keep your promises, and you don't do &quot;what's best for the group.&quot; Instead, you do everything you can to become indispensable, and &quot;everything&quot; is literal here &ndash; even if it means stealing from, betraying, and blackmailing other players.&#10;&#10;In order to escape from Alcatraz, the players need to complete six parts of a plan. Each part is a &quot;pick-up and deliver&quot; task requiring specific items obtained in different parts of the prison. Once each part of the plan is completed, every player but the scapegoat moves a little closer to escaping, with the scapegoat being voted on each round by all the players &ndash; most likely the player who contributed the least to completing that particular task, but you never know. Thus, you could say that Alcatraz is a cooperative game &ndash; but with a twist.&#10;&#10;The map of the prison constituting the play area is generated randomly each game, providing high replayability. Alcatraz is designed for 3-4 players, and due to its theme and complex gameplay is best suited for mature players.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "'Dungeoneer - Perilous Adventures in an Ever-Changing Labyrinth.&#10;&#10;In Dungeoneer', you take up the mantle of a great Hero set out to prove your valor in the Tomb of the Lich Lord. To triumph over your rivals, you will need to explore the labyrinth of corridors, defeat the heinous monsters, overcome nefarious traps and be the first to complete all your Quests. But beware, the gods are fickle and to test their Heroes even further, they often bestow upon them Banes as well as Boons.&#10;&#10;Game Description:&#10;&#10;This simple card game is very reminiscent of Wiz-War. Players are dealt one of 4 Heroes, each with varying movement, fighting and magic abilities. The Dwarf for example is very tough, but has no magic value at all. Each Hero also has a value for hit points, the amount of Treasure he can have (carry) at any time and also the number of &quot;Boons&quot; (special abilities) he may have. Players are dealt 3 quest cards initially in front of them (public knowledge) and have 5 Adventure cards in hand.&#10;&#10;Each turn a player may:&#10;&#10;     Discard unwanted cards and draw back to 5 cards.&#10;     Play Encounters and/or Bane cards (always on opponents never on yourself).&#10;     Build the Dungeon.&#10;     Move (collect Peril and Glory tokens).&#10;&#10;&#10;Players will collect Peril tokens as they move which then makes them targets for others to play Encounter/Bane cards against them (Encounter/Bane cards have a fee to play - which is paid for by the person who the card is played ON with Peril tokens). This  simple mechanic balances the game by spreading the attacks around as you can't attack someone that can't pay the Peril price.&#10;&#10;Players attempt various quests (some are simple die rolls in a certain room, some are tough combat and some a series of things to do), with each completed quest having your Hero &quot;go up a level&quot; which increases his abilities.&#10;&#10;Treasures &amp; Boons help you, Banes, Traps &amp; Encounters hurt you (which are played on you by other players).&#10;&#10;The dungeon map is different each time as it is made up of cards played one at time onto the table by each player.&#10;&#10;This game was introduced at DunDraCon 2003, in San Ramon, Ca. There are several planned expansions, and two special cards available by mail if you purchased at the convention.&#10;&#10;First game in the Dungeoneer Series.&#10;&#10;",

During their reign, two daughters of the House of Gonzaga married Holy Roman Emperors. In Gonzaga, players must get into the expansionist spirit of the times and build fiefdoms across Europe to stake a claim on harbors and cities, while also trying to complete secret missions. The game lasts 7-12 rounds, and players are competing in some of six regions in Europe. (The number of regions and the specific regions vary based on the number of players and the scenario tile drawn at the start of the game.)&#10;&#10;A round starts with each player drawing a fief card from their individual deck; each fief card depicts one of twelve fiefs: plastic components comprising multiple hexagonal loops with castles on some of these loops. Each player then secretly chooses both a region card and an action card, then reveals them simultaneously. Part of the fief (but not all of it) must lie in the chosen region, and the action card determines whether a player must play the fief on one or more harbors, on one or more cities, on open land, or on both harbors and cities. With this last action &ndash; the alliance card &ndash; a player can alternatively place one or two of six individual rings on the board, even on spaces that another player has already claimed with a fief. You score points for covering cities and harbors, for connecting at least three harbors in a sea, and for setting aside your fief as a donation to the church. The cards you play are set aside for the next turn, thereby forcing you to switch regions and actions as you place fiefs.&#10;&#10;The game ends either after twelve rounds or after a trigger point based on the cities and harbors not covered. The player with the most connected fiefs, including the individual rings, scores a bonus, then players reveal their hidden objectives and score based on the number of target cities they covered.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Hex was invented by the Danish mathematician and poet Piet Hein, who introduced the game in 1942 at the Niels Bohr Institute. The same year Hex appeared in the Danish newspaper Politiken under the name Polygon. Hein introduced the game to the readers on December 26, 1942 and during the following four months gave them a problem each day to begin with - eventually two days a week, on Wednesdays and Saturdays. The solution would always appear in the following column. It was independently invented by mathematician John Nash in 1947 at Princeton University. In 1952, Parker Brothers marketed a version. They called their version Hex, and the name stuck. Hex has the simplest rules of almost any game: connect your color edges with a path of tokens of your color. There is also a &quot;swap rule&quot; (also known as a pie rule) which compensates for the inherent advantage of the first player.&#10;&#10;There are a number of resources for Hex on the internet, including several real-time servers. If you want to play face-to-face, used Hex sets are occasionally available, and you can also make your own set. A Battlemat with 1&quot; hexes can be cut into a 15x15 rhombus grid. Standard Go stones also work well for this board.  It is also playable as a pencil-and-paper game, like the 3M Paper Game version.&#10;&#10;",

Each game consists of ten hands, with the hand size shrinking by one each time, until the final one-card hand.  Along the way, trump is randomly determined and can be changed during the hand through the use of special cards.  There are also special cards that make the trump not count for a trick, others that can be declared any suit and value when played, and others that will give bonuses or penalties for taking the trick on which they're played.

The rest of you will satisfy the dragon's hunger.&#10;&#10;In every game of Drakon, you and your opponents must fight to stay alive in the midst of the labyrinth. On your turn, you can either move your hero to another room, or add another piece to the labyrinth, placing beneficial chambers in your own path and throwing your opponents into harm's way. But you must be cautious. The chambers of Drakon's labyrinth are filled with danger and ancient magics, not to mention the dragon herself. To navigate these deadly corridors and survive, you&rsquo;ll need to be quick and careful.&#10;&#10;On every turn, you have a crucial choice to make. You can either move forward into a new chamber, or you can expand the labyrinth by playing a new chamber tile from your hand. The new chambers that you play feature unique circumstances and magical objects that you may encounter on your adventures through Drakon's lair.&#10;&#10;The majority of these chambers offer powerful effects to any hero that enters the chamber. You may gain the power to destroy any chamber in the labyrinth, or call a windstorm to carry you along, increasing your movement. You may even take command of a floating chamber and fly it to the other side of the labyrinth. Other chambers force more harmful effects on those heroes unlucky enough to enter. A room may cause you to lose a coin as you avoid the dangers within, and any hero who hears the siren song of the magical harp is forced to move into its chamber. As you and your fellow heroes play these chambers from your hand, they form a cunning maze, and only the wise can find their way out.&#10;&#10;Despite the power of these chambers, the central goal of your quest is to find gold: only by being the first player to claim ten gold can you escape the dungeon. Plenty of chambers allow you to find a coin or steal a coin from an opponent, but the gold value of coins can vary dramatically. Your most recently stolen coin may have a value of three gold or just one. Because coins are kept face-down, hiding their value, you'll never know exactly how close your opponents are to victory.&#10;&#10;Six heroes are trapped within Drakon's sadistic labyrinth, and each hero has his own unique abilities to help him survive. Each ability can only be used once per game though, making the timing of the ability incredibly important. You may play as the sorceress and escape from a most dire situation by passing through a wall. You may play as the thief and collect the gold you need at the most opportune moment by preying on another hero. You may even play as the ranger and use a burst of speed to race across the maze when necessary. No matter which hero you play in a game of Drakon, you'll need to take full advantage of your unique ability at the opportune moment if you want to grab the gold and escape from Drakon's clutches.&#10;&#10;Of course, the heroes are not alone in the labyrinth. The legendary dragon also stalks the halls and chambers of the maze, taunting any hero unlucky enough to encounter her. Certain chambers throughout the labyrinth allow you to move Drakon through the dungeon. If you can move Drakon into the same chamber as a hapless hero, that hero is immediately sent back to the entrance chamber and loses three coins, as Drakon toys with him before releasing him once more into the maze.&#10;&#10;You and your rival heroes are trapped. Your greatest threat may be Drakon or the other heroes. In this dark labyrinth, only one thing can save you: your own greed. Will you ruthlessly grab gold and undermine your opponent&rsquo;s schemes before escaping to victory? Or will you fail and become just another meal for the dragon? You decide your fate, but only one hero can escape from Drakon!&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "&quot;Hearts and Minds: Vietnam 1965-1975 (Third Edition)&quot; is an uncomplicated approach to a very complicated conflict. Eight scenarios introduce players to U.S. involvement in Southeast Asia including a scenario after the US withdrew from Vietnam, a full campaign scenario as well as high solitaire capability. Players appreciate the ability to start in any year of the war they wish and fight to the end of any other year of the war. The game provides a comprehensive historical approach using mechanics that include guerrilla warfare, faction differentiation, political turmoil, and veteran advantages. This design has already been used as a successful teaching tool.&#10;&#10;This is a card-driven, area-based design with low counter density and a much simplified combat system. Each scenario represents a year and players have the flexibility of starting in any year of the war and ending in any later year of the war. Players choose either the Allies (US, ARVN, Cambodian and Laotian) or Communist (NVA, VC, Cambodian and Laotian) Players engage in guerrilla warfare &ndash; VC units remain hidden until engaged. VC units may be simple units or reinforced units or simply false information. When determined to be false information, players roll on the Bush Events Table which involve events from discovering Chinese troops to the arrival of USO shows featuring John Wayne and Bob Hope.&#10;&#10;This edition involves the use of three card decks, A red deck (communist), a blue deck (Allied) and a black deck (interchangeable). Prior to every game, half of the black deck is shuffled into each of the red and blue decks ensuring a different game every time. Cards indicate the amount of RPs (Resource Points) that may be spent or banked, a historic situation, and its game effects. Certain cards are year specific. Within each Red and Blue Deck are a number of Campaign cards that may be chosen by each player allowing increased abilities but only in a predetermined area.&#10;&#10;The game does not ignore political ramifications. Card events cover mass protests in the U.S. and more significantly the instability of the South Vietnamese government. The Allied player controls more firepower but must walk a tightrope between U.S. and ARVN (South Vietnamese) casualties. Too many U.S. casualties leads to a rapid rise in Communist morale.  Too many ARVN casualties will result in a coup which has major strategic advantages for the Communist Player. While in Cambodia and Laos, the destruction of all government forces means the fall of those governments. Throughout the game both sides jockey for the &ldquo;Hearts and Minds&rdquo; in each province. Political Control determines the availability and expansion of VC influence.&#10;&#10;Hearts and Minds, Third Edition offers players an easier to follow rulebook with simpler victory conditions. Also included: tested solitaire rules and a separate solitaire player aide; a premium mounted map that includes all of the charts necessary to play the game; full-sized poker quality card deck; standard playing dice and a new artistic approach to factional units.&#10;&#10;Product Information&#10;&#10;Complexity: Low to Medium (4 out of 10)&#10;Solitaire suitability: Medium to high  (7 out of 10)&#10;Time Scale: Each scenario represents one year. The campaign game covers 8-10 years.&#10;Map Scale: The Map is divided into provincial areas, indicating major cities and US major bases&#10;Unit Scale:  Units are abstract and represent US, ARVN, NVA, VC, Cambodian and Laotian&#10;Players: Two Player game (Solitaire friendly)&#10;Playing Time:  45 minutes or less per scenario&#10;Designer: John Poniske  &#10;Original Developer: Stan Hilinski&#10;Solitaire Developer: David Wessman&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;24 page rule/scenario book&#10;Solitaire Player Aid&#10;Three Counter sheets (3/4&rdquo; Counters)&#10;22&rdquo; x 33&rdquo; Mounted Map&#10;80 Standard Playing Cards (27 Red/27 Blue/ 28 black)&#10;Two 6-sided dice (1 Red/1Blue)&#10;One box and lid set&#10;&#10;-from the publisher's website&#10;&#10;",

Will you take what you really want, or a different card so as to deprive another player of something cool?&#10;&#10;At the end of each round, players mark different things off on their score sheets, corresponding to what they earned from the cards they selected. Players earn points for seeing sights, collecting Australiana, seeing animals, and so on. After five rounds, the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "KeyForge: Dark Tidings is the fifth series in the KeyForge line. As always, each deck in the line contains cards from three of the seven houses included in the line, but for Dark Tidings the Dis house will be replaced with the Unfathomable, which  specializes in controlling their foes by exhausting enemy creatures. Some cards keep your opponent's creatures down, making it difficult for them to muster a fighting force or reap enough &aelig;mber. Once your enemies are exhausted, you can keep them out of commission with other cards or even wipe away their board.&#10;&#10;Each Dark Tidings deck also includes a high/low tide card. The card starts the game out of play, but eventually one player will bring it into play, especially since some cards in Dark Tidings can carry out their effects &mdash; or have a massively larger effect &mdash; when the high tide is on that player's side. Many effects can raise the tide, but if they're not available, the player with low tide can always suffer three chains to turn the tide in their favor.&#10;&#10;Dark Tidings also features the debut of &quot;evil twin decks&quot;, a new type of deck. For example, you may open a deck that's entitled &quot;Speaker Domitia's Evil Twin&quot;. This deck is an exact copy of &quot;Speaker Domitia&quot;, a real deck that has been printed and can be found by another player out in the world. The crucial difference is that in an evil twin deck, many of your creatures look a little different. Specifically, in Dark Tidings, many creatures have evil twin variants, and if you find an evil twin deck, every creature with an evil twin variant appears in that form. These evil twin creatures feature new artwork, graphic design, and abilities, making them a significant departure from the original creature.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Reichbusters: Projekt Vril is a fast and furious game with lots of weird science, witty one-liners, and heroic moments set during World War II. It is late December 1944 and, on the face of it, history has unfolded as we know it, but that could be about to change.&#10;&#10;The Nazis have discovered a source of &quot;vril&quot; that has been brought back to the Reich for study. Vril is a source of energy that can control all types of matter. It can destroy like lightning or replenish life, heal, or cure. It is used to rend through solid matter. Its light is said to be steadier, softer and healthier than that from any flammable material. It can also be used as a power source for animating mechanisms.&#10;&#10;If the Nazis work out how to harness this power it will be more potent than the atomic bomb. The secret Nazi experiments are not just a threat to the outcome of the war, but to the entire world. Many different secret bunkers hold all manner of research into the properties of the enigmatic vril and we're sending you, the Reichbusters, on a mission to stop this research in its tracks!&#10;&#10;Players will choose from a selection of Allied Heroes and visit R&amp;D to prepare equipment before venturing out on missions against the evil &quot;Vrilmeisters&quot;. Mission objectives will vary from mission to mission while secondary objectives could appear as the heroes explore the bunkers. Each mission will see the players facing off against more and more heinous enemies, from re-animated corpses to dark experiments, and from ferocious mutations gone wrong to the evil Vrilmeisters themselves.&#10;&#10;Each mission begins with the heroes infiltrating, making the use of stealth, hidden actions and minimising noise to make their way towards their objective undetected. Players will have to choose how long to remain quiet because time will be of the essence.&#10;&#10;Inevitably, however, the Nazis will discover the presence of the heroes and once the alarm is raised, players need to be prepared for all hell to break loose. Once the objective has been completed the heroes must escape to report back their success, however, anyone left behind will be captured and unavailable in future missions if playing a campaign.&#10;&#10;Players will be able to take part in an ongoing Campaign of missions or they can set up a Raid with random maps, heroes, and Nazi faction to fight against.&#10;&#10;Game Play&#10;Reichbusters: Projekt Vril is a fully co-operative game so the heroes will either succeed or fail together.&#10;&#10;While remaining hidden players can choose the player order and on their turn players can take a number of actions including Moving, Fighting, Drawing, Picking up Items &amp; Interacting with board elements.&#10;&#10;In addition to base actions, players will also have their hero specific card decks. These cards modify actions as they happen such as adding dice to attacks or making more tactical movement. The hero cards can also be used to take additional actions beyond your base actions.&#10;&#10;Each hero also comes with exciting Feats which can be used to turn the tide or secure that crucial objective right when you need to. On top of that, each hero receives a number of &ldquo;Heroics&rdquo; at the beginning of the game. &ldquo;Heroics&rdquo; can be spent to automatically succeed at tests such as attacks. In desperate moments you can also use &ldquo;Heroics&rdquo; to prevent failed tests, but this will find you running out of them fast!&#10;&#10;Throughout the game, the players will find items that they can carry and use. Some of these will be things they are looking for as part of their missions. Other things will be useful stuff like medical supplies, vril healing potions, guns, grenades, etc.&#10;&#10;Custom dice will be used to decide the outcome of attacks, defence and the impacts of noise created by players. Each card tells you how much noise it creates, and how much Nazi activity it triggers. The more cards you play, the more noise you generate, and the more the Nazis act in response.&#10;&#10;The Nazi reinforcements will be relentless so the heroes need to complete their objective and escape before time runs out and they get overwhelmed by the Nazi forces and their vril tech.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Unbeknownst to the powers in Harrows some of those leaders, namely the players, are secretly evil to the core and in the thrall of the Necromancer. Once away from the bustling city and the oversight of the courts, these overlords create domains that outwardly appear to be beacons of light and hope. Eventually however, their true colors will come through and those upstanding pillars of the community will retreat to their lairs as the masquerade ends and their lands begin to decay into wastelands overrun by foul monsters and nefarious henchmen.&#10;&#10;But all is not peaches and cream in the lands of darkness. Harrows is home to the famous Torin Company and its never-ending supply of heroes and adventurers. Once the word reaches Harrows that darkness is afoot in the Domains, it is only a matter of time before these nosy adventurers begin to seek out the dens of horror to stop the evil.&#10;&#10;Dark Domains is a worker placement game where 2-5 players attempt to create a Domain that provides them the most evil, depicted in the game by skulls. Players must use Minions, Henchmen, Monsters &amp; Magic to stamp out the good, repel the Torin Company and cover their land in darkness.&#10;&#10;Tarot cards are used in the game as events to live up each turn and to regulate the phases of the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "In Tycoon, players are businessmen traveling around the world, doing what businessmen do: making money.  In this case, business is defined as opening hotels and factories in major cities, like Sydney, Cairo, and New York.&#10;&#10;Players are seeking to build hotels in as many cities as possible while also building the first or second most hotels in given cites to earn money, which is also your score. Additional money can be earned by building factories in each city, but these are limited in number.&#10;&#10;During the course of the game players will take turns buying and/or using plane tickets to move about the board's nine cities. A number of tickets are displayed in rows, divided into two types: The more expensive scheduled flights which allow you to move directly to the printed city, or move your token a number of city spaces orthogonally on the board. Cheaper charter flights allow movement directly between the two city spaces printed on the ticket. You may buy tickets at any time during your turn, and you are not required to move but must do so before taking any regular actions; you may also use any many tickets in a turn as you wish.&#10;&#10;The regular actions include building hotels and factories. Hotels are built on a u-shaped track. When a hotel is built on a red space the building that is oldest/furthest back on the track is removed. Players with the first and second most hotels on the track will be the only ones to score, with ties broken by the player with the earliest bulding on the track. There are only two factory spaces per city, and they will score points equal to the second place of the hotel scoring. In lieu of any actions or flying, or if you simply have no money, you may also take out loans; this removes your token from the board and forces you to use the more costly scheduled flights to return to the board.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game players are given all of their factories. Each round players are given a set number of hotels in addition to any they have left over from the previous round. When any player has built all of the hotels in front of them a scoring occurs. After three scorings the game ends and the player with the most money is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

When they're ready, players 'roll the presses' to claim those stories where their reporters have a majority and assemble them on their 'front page' player mat. The score of each press run is determined by the current values in each of the five news beats. Stories also have 'star' values, and the player with the most stars in each news beat gets that beat's endgame bonus.&#10;&#10;The end of the game is triggered when one player publishes his fourth (in a two- or three-player game) or third (in a four- or five-player game) newspaper.

Their main purpose is to increase the standard of living, and thus the happiness of its citizens. They have within reach a whole range of projects that the city council wants to achieve, but which lack the funds. By skillfully selecting plans, using available space and deciding which projects their money should be spent on they will be expanding the city and competing for the title of the most people-friendly company.&#10;&#10;During play, the game board is expanded by players laying down tiles, with each tile representing a piece of the city, a district that might need to be provided with electricity or water in exchange for receiving some benefit. Some of the tiles require a supply of luxury goods; others generate them; others give only points of happiness, such as the hospital.&#10;&#10;Resources are common, and each of them can be bought by players from power stations and waterworks. These resources, however, are not unlimited and their use must be well planned. Keep in mind, too, that you must pay opponents when transporting raw materials through districts they own.&#10;&#10;Game play in City Tycoon passes through four stages, and in each of them the buildings get larger and more impressive while at the same time requiring more resources and giving better benefits. Players quickly notice the relations between them and may choose several possible strategies to develop their investments, for example, focusing on making money, constructing scoring buildings to the exclusion of all else. Each of these strategies has its pluses and minuses, and the actions of other players might force you to expand in new directions and change your tactic.&#10;&#10;",

Players work to create the most promising design to be chosen for production. Each turn players draft cards into their hands as cards are laid out on the board. Players strategically place negotiator chips between the cards they want, using their alignment and position to determine who has the most influence over a desired card. Once all negotiators and tokens are placed, influence is calculated and the winners of each card is determined.&#10;&#10;Once obtained, cards can be played for points, adding value to your ark, or discarded for resources. Each card represents a different component of the ark &mdash; locations, items, personnel &mdash; and players will find unique synergies between cards as well as their player color's unique power.

    "description": "From the back of the game box:&#10;&#10;Totaler Krieg!&#10;This game stretches from the fjords of Narvik to the sands at El Alamein, from the gates of Moscow to the sandy beaches of Normandy, from the Spanish Civil War to the last days in Berlin and everything in between. No game tells the story of World War II in Europe like Totaler Krieg!&#10;&#10;This new edition of our popular Krieg! game is still the same highly playable, unpredictable and enjoyable experience it always has been. What&rsquo;s new is a design and graphic update and expansion to give you more options -- especially if you want to explore the critical pre-war period from 1937 to 1939. What if the Republicans had won the Spanish Civil War? What if Germany and Russia hadn&rsquo;t signed their Non-Aggression Pact? What if France had modernized its army instead of building the Maginot Line? All of these options are literally in the cards that form the strategies of the three factions -- Axis, Soviet Allies, and Western Allies.&#10;&#10;Best of all, Totaler Krieg! can be linked with its new Pacific companion game, Axis Empires: Dai Senso! &#226;&#128;&#147; World War II in Asia & the Pacific, 1937-45, to play the joint Axis Empires scenario, an eye-opening global look at all of World War II. The fate of the world is in your hands!&#10;&#10;Totaler Krieg means Total War in German. In the game, play moves from Pre-War (where players mobilize their forces and engage in diplomacy) to Limited War (when open conflict begins) to Total War -- at that point, it&rsquo;s all-out warfare to achieve victory!&#10;&#10;Includes:&#10;&#10;    Two 22 x 34 inch maps&#10;    840 counters on three countersheets&#10;    200 cards&#10;    A 64-page rulebook&#10;    A 24-page scenario book&#10;    Play aids and force pool displays&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Then cards are dealt to each player. They look at their cards and randomly place the cards face-down in front of them. SWATs win together if they deactivate the time bomb by revealing all of the SUCCESS cards.&#10;&#10;Each turn, a player chooses a card in front of another player and reveal it. If it is a SUCCESS card, SWATs get closer to winning. Otherwise it is a threat card, and its threat effect is activated according to its color.

Each player has a hand of maneuver cards which he uses to improve his position relative to an enemy plane or fire on the enemy. The opponent is allowed to counter the maneuver by playing cards of his own, to which original player can counter back, etc. The last player to play a card determines whether the original action occurs or not.&#10;&#10;Each plane is rated with horsepower (which indicates how many card you can draw), performance (how many cards to be held), burst (the values of fire cards that can be played), etc. The number of cards in your hand abstractly represents the momentum of each aircraft.&#10;&#10;A dogfight lasts a mere 6 turns and take about 15 minutes to play. There are also campaign games which represent a number of interconnected missions and various operations the players can take. A campaign can take about 2-3 hours.&#10;&#10;",

You are one of these superstars on a quest for wealth, and you must overcome the gravitational challenges set before you!&#10;&#10;What is really original about Gravity Superstar is the manner in which the players' pawns move: Each turn, they move one or two spaces, then they are affected by gravity, which makes them fall until they are stopped by a platform. This effect is made possible by the fact that the pawns are used lying down on the board. Thus, they move up (above their head), down (below their feet), left, or right.&#10;&#10;During its movement, a pawn can collect stars (to score points at the end of the game) or replay tokens (to take a second consecutive turn), and eject opponents' pawns from the board.&#10;&#10;",

Over the course of the game, you will perform actions &mdash; and follow the actions of other players &mdash; to produce units, build fortifications, maneuver around the map, and spend your followers to climb the ritual track. Throughout the game, a haunting Cathedral will grow in the center of the board, and once it is completed, you will face &mdash; and gain the ability to control! &mdash; the physical manifestations of nightmares that are released upon the world. Nightmare Cathedral is a game of both strategy and tactics, where finding clever ways to follow your objectives and combining different strategies is the ultimate route to victory.&#10;&#10;Each player has a set of Action cards. These Action cards display various effects that may be activated either on that player's own turn, or as a reaction when other players perform that action. When you are the Active Player, you will move your Dreamer to a Day space that is not adjacent to its current Night space and perform the Action associated with that Day space, as outlined on your own Action card.&#10;Inactive Players may react to your chosen Day Action.&#10;&#10;The game is divided into two stages. During the first stage, the titular Nightmare Cathedral is built, piece by piece, as the game progresses. Once the final Cathedral piece is placed on the main board, the Nightmare Cathedral is finished, at which point the game transitions to the second stage. From this moment on, Nightmares, powerful beings channeling the presence of the completed Cathedral, enter the game board, Devouring Units in their path. However, as a player, you may also take actions to control a Nightmare, Commanding it to do your bidding.&#10;&#10;The game end is triggered in one of the following ways:&#10;&#10;&#10;     The Time marker reaches a certain space on the Time track.&#10;     A single player reaches the final step of the Ritual track.&#10;     A certain number of Units have been devoured.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

However, hope is not lost, a mystical portal of 10 components can be built and save the island and all its inhabitants, but fail to build it in time and the island will sink forever under the waves, lost to legend.&#10;&#10;Atlantis Rising is a fully co-operative game in which the players must race to create a cosmic gate before all of the island tiles have been destroyed. The gate's components are variable and determine the difficulty level of the game - Easy, Normal, Hard, or Cosmic. The players must also contend with the continually escalating threat of their Athenian enemies, who may destroy one or more island tiles each turn if insufficient Atlanteans are allocated to the island's protection.&#10;&#10;Each turn players can choose to place their Atlanteans in any of eight different areas - with placements closer to the sea being more rewarding, but subject to a higher risk of flooding (and the subsequent loss of the associated action).&#10;&#10;After placement of meeple but before gaining resources 'misfortune' cards are drawn per player indicating which areas of the island sink, any meeple stood there have a long swim back to shore and do nothing for their turn.&#10;&#10;Players have limited 'mystical energy' which they can use to predict or prevent certain misfortunes and cards are available from the libraries that offer powerful one time use effects.&#10;&#10;&#10;From the back of the box:&#10;&#10;Will you send your Atlanteans to mine the untapped veins of precious resources at the very tip of the island, hoping to reap great rewards before the oncoming waves smash into the shores? Or will you remain in the relative safety of the island&rsquo;s center, where resources have grown scarce? Perhaps you will tap into the power of the mystic energy source - the lifeforce of Atlantis and key to its advanced technology. You may even seek refuge in the vast libraries of the Lost City, hoping to find some tome which will lead to salvation for the doomed isle. Beware though - even as the island sinks into the sea, the Athenians continue to assault Atlantis, hoping to plunder its riches before it disappears beneath the waves.&#10;&#10;",

Sometimes the best racing line is the one that will knock your opponents off-course.&#10;&#10;Gather powerful items as you race, letting you fire rockets, drop oil slicks and even call in air strikes to damage enemy vehicles. Damage permanently blocks part of your dashboard, so think carefully about where you decide to place it. Do you really need two spaces to store items?

    "description": "Created by Paul Randles, designer of Pirate's Cove, and developed by Mike Selinker and Bruno Faidutti, Key Largo transports players into the Florida Keys in 1899. As the new century dawns, players ply the thriving trade of finding treasures in shipwrecks around the island. Before a hurricane hits, players need to search the many shipwrecks and sell the lost treasures to the island denizens for as much cash as possible.&#10;&#10;This was designer Paul Randles' final game before passing away in 2003. Tilsit Editions published it in French, German, and Italian in 2005, and Titanic Games made it available in English for the first time, with an all-new graphic design and pieces.&#10;&#10;The Titanic edition of Key Largo contains:&#10;Full-color board of the island in the Florida Keys&#10;5 wooden boats&#10;1 diving helmet&#10;130 cards&#10;15 divers&#10;40 hoses, tridents, and weights&#10;Money&#10;Full-color rulebook&#10;&#10;The setting :&#10;The action takes place on a Caribbean island, in the very last days on the 19th century. The island has long been a pirate's harbour, and it has recently be found out that there were many sunken galleons around. Hurricane Katty is due in ten days, so you have little time to hire a diver team and bring back as much sunken treasure as possible.&#10;&#10;The systems :&#10;Key Largo is a double-guessing game, like Paul Randles' other game, Pirate's Cove. Every morning, each player secretly decides what he will do the coming day - take tourists dolphin watching, search a wreck for treasures, sell treasures at the market, buy equipment at the local shop, or go to the tavern to hire more divers and listen to the rumours. It's also a light management game, where you start with little cash and must make your money grow through fruitful investment. The winner is the richest player when the hurricane breaks through and stops all diving around the island.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "From the Publisher:&#10;&#10;'Light Speed is a lightning-fast card game of space combat about identical teams of spaceships dropping out of hyperspace to do battle over an extremely important asteroid. Each spaceship is equipped with 1 to 4 lasers, and the lasers have 3 different &quot;strengths&quot;&#10;&#10;The game is played in two stages. In the &quot;fast round&quot; players play their cards onto a table, trying to position them so that their laser beams will hit either the asteroid (and thereby &quot;mining&quot; it) or other players (causing them damage). Once one player has gotten rid of all of their cards, the &quot;scoring round&quot; begins.&#10;&#10;In the Scoring round, all ships of the same rank will fire at the same time. (All &quot;1&quot; ships will fire, then all &quot;2&quot; ships, etc.) If, after all the ships of the same rank have fired, a ship has more damage than it does Health, the ship is destroyed. Play continues through the ranks 1-10. Once all ships have fired, players receive 1 point for each point of health they took from their opponent, plus one point for each successful &quot;mining&quot; of the asteroid.&#10;&#10;Light Speed is part of the Hip Pocket Games series.&#10;&#10;Awards&#10;&#10;    2004 Listed in GAMES Magazine's GAMES 100&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "After millions of years of wasteland on Earth, animal life is finally emerging. But the world is still forming and undergoing a constant change. Only those species able to adapt to the ever-changing conditions will survive to leave their mark in history. Here is your chance! Do your best to become Darwin&rsquo;s Choice.&#10;&#10;Darwin's Choice is a competitive card game in which players create their own animal species from more than 230 animal cards. These animal species will be placed in biomes that differ strongly in their requirements and the food supply. The highest possible adaptation of animal species to their biomes not only ensures their survival but is also rewarded with the coveted Darwin points. In addition to a high adaptation the species with the highest competitive strength are also awarded across all zones.&#10;&#10;Between the 3-4 eras played, conditions can change completely due to biome changes and event card effects. The task now is to adapt the successful animal species of the past eras to the conditions of the present, either through sophisticated mutations or smart migration to other biomes. However, you must always keep an eye on the animal species of the other players in order to anticipate their actions, because anyone who acts too quickly or imprudently might be unable to react at the decisive moment.&#10;&#10;In Darwin's Choice the victory points (Darwin Points) are assigned to the animal species and may only be collected by players after the last era has ended. With this mechanism, the game remains exciting to the very end, because the extinction of a species also means the loss of its associated Darwin points.&#10;&#10;Darwin's Choice is a strategic allocation game in which you must think carefully about how to use your cards. The large number of own possibilities and the ones of your opponents lead to a high variability, which makes thinking through each action and thinking ahead indispensable. The randomness caused by drawing cards (animal cards, biomes, event cards) requires flexibility and fast rescheduling. This results in each played game being completely different and guarantees a high replayability.&#10;&#10;All pictures, icons and symbols of Darwin&rsquo;s Choice are hand-illustrated by the French illustrator Rozenn Grosjean, giving the game its very own style.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

In fact, it is fairly common among Deep Space Miners (5th class), and some say that it is almost unavoidable. And, well, it is. Especially since the crystals that you seek happen to be inside giant space beasts. To mine them, you need to, well, be eaten.&#10;&#10;But, no reason to panic.

This handy simulation/survival guide is standard issue for all recruits and will eventually lead to a productive, if not potentially brief, career in space mining.&#10;&#10;Should you achieve your objective and mine enough crystals to meet your quota, it is then cost-effective for the company to activate your jet pack and extricate you from the proverbial belly of the beast. While the beast&rsquo;s immune response was not enough to prevent its demise, its contribution to human progress and corporate profitability are most definitely appreciated.&#10;&#10;In the eventuality that the bacteria present in the beast overwhelm you and you are digested, do not worry. Your non-organic parts will ultimately provide much utility to future space miners. In fact, you may encounter some such pieces of equipment in your expedition, remains of attempts by evidently less-than-qualified recruits.&#10;&#10;Finally, it could transpire that you do not collect the necessary crystals by the time you reach the end of the beast's digestive tract. In this case, the so-called &quot;ending #2&quot;, you will then exit the beast from the other end than the one you entered. Alive, and yet forever changed. In this case, and after a thorough decontamination and quarantine period, we will have to evaluate your performance versus that of the beast&rsquo;s efforts to consume you.&#10;&#10;In So, You've Been Eaten. the Miner and the Beast face off against one another. The Miner earns points by collecting crystals, and the Beast earns points by developing immune responses and by its bacteria attacking the Miner.&#10;&#10;The Miner wins instantly by collecting all eight different crystals, and the Beast wins instantly by digesting the Miner after the attack of four bacteria of the same type.

The other player controls the forces of the United Kingdom and the United States and they must stem the tide of German armor and hold their positions until reinforcements arrive.&#10;&#10;Axis &amp; Allies Battle of the Bulge is designed for two players and can be played in three to four hours. Axis &amp; Allies Battle of the Bulge is the fourth Axis &amp; Allies variant, following the successful Axis &amp; Allies D-Day, Axis &amp; Allies Europe and Axis &amp; Allies Pacific versions. Axis &amp; Allies Battle of the Bulge is available on November 17th, 2006.&#10;&#10;Box Dimension: 15.8 x 10.5 x 3&#10;&#10;",

While you begin armed only with basic combat maneuvers, you'll add new, more powerful cards to your deck as you go, with the goal of defeating the deadly forces that serve Sauron as you make your way towards Mount Doom.&#10;&#10;While The Two Towers can be combined with Cryptozoic's The Fellowship of the Ring Deck-Building Game, it's also playable on its own, and unlike that previous game, it includes a &quot;Wall of Helm's Deep&quot; deck that adds a new element to gameplay. If The Wall can't defend the wall from Saruman's forces and it becomes breached, the battle will get tougher for the heroes!&#10;&#10;Cryptozoic's The Lord of the Rings/The Hobbit deck-builder series:&#10;&#10;&#10;     The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring Deck-Building Game&#10;     The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers Deck-Building Game&#10;     The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King Deck-Building Game&#10;     The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey Deck-Building Game&#10;     The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug Deck-Building Game Expansion Pack&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "2GM Tactics is a full-fledged strategy card war-game where units are represented by cards and you&rsquo;ll be in command of your army. You&rsquo;ll have to build your deck to achieve the goals you&rsquo;ve been tasked for. Gear up your troops for the battle; deploy all type of units: armor, artillery and transport units; request air support and deceive your enemy. Lead Patton or Rommel to the final victory; seize buildings; destroy your enemy and conquer the battlefield! Play historical scenarios: go ashore in Normandy, defend Monte Cassino or dig in the Ardennes!&#10;&#10;You can play 2GM TWG in two ways. You can play a &ldquo;Battle Royal&rdquo; - players will establish a number of points, they will set up the battlefield prior commencing the battle and the goal is to destroy your opponent&rsquo;s Head Quarter; or you can play a &ldquo;Scenario&rdquo; &ndash; historical or not &ndash; with a predefined set of rules to deploy units and the terrain, and pre-established conditions of victory.&#10;&#10;In a player&rsquo;s turn you&rsquo;ll gain a number of &ldquo;Action Points&rdquo; that will be used to deploy new units on the battlefield and to employ other supporting cards. These Action Points will increase by several ways as the game evolves.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;Objectives&rdquo; to achieve the victory during a game are very diverse: from destroying your opponent&rsquo;s HQ to capture the battlefield or inflict a specific number of kills to your enemy. Seizing or bombing a building, capturing enemy&rsquo;s supplies, rescue a flag objective or hold a position for a number of turns are other ways to achieve the victory.&#10;&#10;The game includes three different decks: one for the American Army, one for the German Army and a third double-sided deck to represent different types of Terrain.&#10;&#10;Each side&rsquo;s deck is composed by cards representing unique types of units and supporting cards. Different types of units - infantry, vehicle, armor, aircraft and transport -, all with their own specific capabilities and with additional equipment to be deployed.&#10;&#10;Supporting cards are assorted: you may find &ldquo;Equipment&rdquo;, &ldquo;Promotion&rdquo;, &ldquo;Mines&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Diversion&rdquo;, among others.&#10;&#10;Terrain deck includes anything that is needed to make every single battle a unique experience.&#10;&#10;Additionally, you&acute;ll find Help and Summary cards along with Flag Generals that will improve your army with their command abilities; 2d10 and more than 100 counters (damage counters, victory points, etc.) and additional equipment to gear up our units depending on the situation.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "The Mighty Endeavor is the 17th game in the Standard Combat Series (SCS), and covers the Western Allied Invasion of France in 1944, the crossing of the Rhine River in early 1945 and the final push into Germany.&#10;&#10;Players can land at the places of their choosing and manner along the coast of France in an effort to liberate France and the Low Countries from German occupation and to cross the Rhine and take the German industrial cities along that river.&#10;&#10;The Mighty Endeavor - revised &amp; expanded edition is both an updated version (with errata corrected, a couple of counters added, and other counters made to conform to the Expansion) covering the Western Front from the D-Day landings until the end of April 1945 and an expansion to the original game that adds the Eastern Front from just east of Warsaw during the same time period and a small map attachment that adds the Brittany Peninsula.&#10;&#10;Following the same allocation of responsibilities as the game Battle for Germany (SPI, 1975), one player controls the Western Allies and the East Front Germans while the other controls the Russians and the West Front Germans. The two players compete by seeing which grouping of Allies can conquer as much German territory as possible&mdash;while they also play against their opponent to stop the opposite front. Never a dull moment as both players are always playing one side or the other at the same time.&#10;&#10;The scenarios start the campaign at various points and as an added feature, the game includes a 16 Dec 44 (Bulge) campaign start for the Western Front.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;&#10;    Game Turn: 10 to 15 days&#10;    Hex: 15 miles / 24.1 Km&#10;    Units: Company to Corps&#10;&#10;&#10;Contents (Original edition):&#10;&#10;    One 22 x 34&quot; map (France except Brittany, Belgium, Netherlands, West Germany)&#10;    One countersheet (280 1/2&quot; dual-side printed counters)&#10;    One 8-page SCS-specific series rulebook &#10;    One 16-page TME specific rulebook&#10;&#10;&#10;Contents (Revised &amp; Expanded edition):&#10;&#10;    One 22 x 34&quot; full-color map (France except Brittany, Belgium, Netherlands, West Germany)&#10;    One 22 x 28&quot; full-color map (Germany except west, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Hungary)&#10;    One 8.5 x 11&quot; full-color map  (Brittany)&#10;    Two countersheets (560 1/2&quot; dual-side printed counters)&#10;    One 8-page SCS-specific v1.7 rulebook&#10;    One 16-page TME-revised specific rulebook&#10;    One 16-page TME-Expansion rulebook&#10;&#10;&#10;(source: MMP website and user's description)&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "People refer to this vast place only as the desert since no one remembers what was here before. The golden age of human beings has long passed. Now there is only sand, and the only hope is in the humidity.&#10;&#10;Travelers cross the desert that stretches from the slopes of the Akaishi Mountains to the cliffs of Seaclaw. Half-ruined ancient cities are home to the last human communities struggling to survive by foraging for what little green remains standing. These desert travelers transport goods on the backs of their caterpillars. Although their only goal is to make as much money as they can, at the same time and in a more or less deliberate way, they are helping to bring life back to the desert by carrying small plants from the artificial greenhouses of the cities to the most remote corners of this ocean of sand.&#10;&#10;Designed by Ariel Di Costanzo and Javier Pelizzari and illustrated by Ernest Sala, Sand is a game with a main mechanism of pick-up-and-deliver that can be enjoyed alone or in groups of up to four players in games of about 120 minutes long. Players have to earn as much gold as possible after six rounds (five in a four-player game) to win.&#10;&#10;In Sand, players put themselves in the shoes of these intrepid desert travelers who travel the paths of the board and visit the different towns. They collect goods to take them to other places and thus earn gold for the transport service. They cross the dunes on the backs of their faithful caterpillars, which, cared for, will grow and help players complete their tasks more effectively. Along the way they will be joined by helpful companions and be entrusted with missions that, if completed, will bring good benefits at the end of the journey. Help the plants take root again, and perhaps there is still some hope for this desolate place...&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Play a card, draw a card &mdash; that couldn't be easier, right?&#10;&#10;Don't be fooled, though, because even though the title claims this game is quick and easy, The Game: Quick &amp; Easy will not be easy to defeat. You can do so only as a real team! In more detail, to win you must play all fifty cards in the deck on the two discard piles. The deck consists of fifty cards, with cards coming in five colors numbered 1-10 in each color. Each player has a hand of two cards.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you play one or two cards onto one or both of the two discard piles. On one pile, you must play a higher card that whatever the top card is, and on the other, you must play a lower card. The exception is that you can play any card on a discard pile if it's the same color as the current top card. Thus, on the ascending discard pile the cards played might be blue 1, red 2, gray 4, yellow 6, yellow 2 &mdash; and that drop down gives you breathing room in which to play more cards.&#10;&#10;You can't reveal the specific numbers you have in hand, but you can say things like, &quot;I have a high yellow card.&quot; In the &quot;professional&quot; version of the game, you must play exactly one card each turn (even if you want to play two), and you can reveal only the color of cards in your hand and on which stack you want to play.&#10;&#10;",
