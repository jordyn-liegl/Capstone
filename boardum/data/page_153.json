    "description": "The party game Werewolf has been popular for many years, but now it's time to put the cat amongst the pigeons &ndash; or the fox amongst the chickens, anyway. In this new take on the classic format, Fox &amp; Chicken sees players fighting for survival, striving for either a Vulpine Victory or Cheering Chickens. As the nights pass, more and more chickens will disappear from the henhouse. Thankfully, during the day the chickens can follow their suspicions and attempt to chase the foxes away. Will they be successful and get rid of their enemies, or are you just going to end up with a lot of fowl language?&#10;&#10;Fox &amp; Chicken is easy to learn, fun to play, and beautiful to look at. With rules included for play with up to twenty people (and potentially even more!) it's a mix of action and accusations, chaotic and clever in equal parts.&#10;&#10;",

The battle was decided in 20 minutes by the devastating charge of Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth cavalry, the Winged Hussars. In effect half of Swedish soldiers had been wounded, killed or captured (Charles IX hardly escaped) and Polish loses were about 300.&#10;The battle ended in the decisive victory of Polish-Lithuanian forces, and is remembered as one of the greatest triumphs of cavalry ever.&#10;&#10;The game comprises a full colour map, and counters (need to be cut).

    "description": "Gun and Gun is an anime-themed card game from Japanese design studio Keepdry that features competitive one-versus-one battles, a distinct two-deck draft system, and gorgeous Japanese sci-fi art!&#10;&#10;In Gun and Gun, players assume the role of one of the game's many Gunners and equip their character with two guns available to them. Once selections have been made, it&rsquo;s a frenetic race to kill each other by reducing either their opponent&rsquo;s life points or their deck size to zero.&#10;&#10;A single copy of Gun and Gun is enough for two players to get right into the gun-wielding action; however, some may wish to use more than one set. Playing with one copy provides a more traditional board game experience with a surprising amount of strategy involved in choosing characters and guns.&#10;&#10;Playing with two sets, however, ups the intensity and overall competitive nature of the game, allowing for an experience that is closer to that of a constructed card game, where players construct their own decks. Either playstyle is a blast, but we would recommend playing with one set first in order to get used to the gameplay and to learn about the strengths and limitations of each character and gun, before moving into the more competitive side of the game.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "For some time, there had been reports that a large area of dense jungle northwest of Saigon was a staging base for the Viet Cong. Ideally situated near Cambodia, a nexus point of the Ho Chi Minh Trail, and proximal to the capital city of Saigon itself, the area that became known as the &ldquo;Iron Triangle&rdquo; allowed the Viet Cong to conduct well-organized and well-supplied operations into the very heart of South Vietnam. In the meantime, a hundred miles to the south, a US riverine force, comprised primarily of the newly-arrived 9th Infantry Division, began to penetrate into the hinterland of the Mekong Delta, and even into the overgrown rivulets where only &lsquo;Charlie&rsquo; had ever operated before.&#10;&#10;In the first in the Vietnam Battles series, two games are included, Iron Triangle and Snoopy&rsquo;s Nose (named after a distinctive curve in one of the distributaries leading to the Mekong River). Both games utilize the very popular Fire &amp; Movement combat system, and is easy to play.&#10;Units in the game are typically companies and some battalions and occasional brigade equivalents. The full spectrum of the war in Vietnam in 1967 is featured with everything from riverine craft to helicopters. Each hex represents about a half mile, and each game turn represents from about a half a day to several days of operations.&#10; The game includes one map (22x34&rdquo;) and 200 counters.&#10;&#10;(from the editor's website)&#10;&#10;Published with Modern War #7, Sep-Oct 2013&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "The Korean War: June 1950 - May 1951, Designer Signature Edition, marks the return of a true wargaming classic by Joseph Balkoski first published in 1986, faithfully remastered and updated with this all-new, supersized edition. Hailed by many as of the premier games covering The Korean War, this two-player operational level simulation covers the first year of the Korean conflict, from June 1950 to May 1951.&#10;&#10;During this period, the United States found itself involved in a bitter struggle in a remote Asian land that many Americans had not even heard of. Amid the debacles and stunning victories of the first year of war, the very foundation of the American military system &mdash; so recently triumphant in the Second World War &mdash; was severely shaken. In a war that few Americans understood and which historians have tended to ignore, the foundation of future American diplomacy in the face of communism was laid.&#10;&#10;The players control ground and air forces of the United Nations, North Korea, and Communist China. Each player's force consists of a wide variety of units, including infantry, marines, paratroopers, armor, and aircraft. The map is a 1:750,000 representation of the Korean peninsula from Pusan in the south to the Yalu River in the north. In addition to controlling military forces, the players must make a number of political decisions that have an important effect on the game. Above all, the UN player must strive to keep international tensions at a minimum for the purpose of preventing World War Three. Intense escalation and mobilization could have disastrous consequences for the militarily-unprepared United States. On the other hand, insufficient force applied to Korea could lead to the conquest of South Korea by North Korean communists.&#10;&#10;This edition of The Korean War features a super-sized map and larger counters and is another Classic Reborn! by Compass.&#10;&#10;This Designer Signature edition of the classic Joseph Balkoski game goes beyond merely incorporating errata found from the original edition; it includes enhancements that include:&#10;&#10;     Larger and easier-to-read 9/16&rdquo; counters and three game maps&#10;     Game map information is updated and includes all-new map artwork&#10;     Enhanced ergonomics are built into the set up and reinforcement charts&#10;     Restrictions on UN build-up and breakdown so UN player cannot perpetually continue Action Phase by reorganizing units&#10;     Modified amphibious assault system that allows UN player to more effectively recreate September 1950 Inchon invasion&#10;     Modified victory conditions that lessen impact of Global Tension&#10;     New random events to make the operation a bit more unpredictable&#10;     Updated rules treatment backed by many illustrations, an index, and clarifications and examples of play to reduce potential questions.&#10;     Updated historical notes&#10;&#10;&#10;Complexity: 7 out of 10&#10;Solitaire Suitability: 6 out of 10 (landing options; no hidden units)&#10;&#10;Time Scale: one month per turn&#10;Map Scale: 7.5 miles per hex&#10;Unit Scale: battalions, regiments, brigades and divisions&#10;&#10;Players: one to two, best with two or more&#10;Playing Time: 4-8 hours depending upon scenario, 20+ hours for campaign&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;    Four map sheets (42.5&quot; x 71&quot;overall map dimension)&#10;    Three countersheets (9/16&quot; size)&#10;    Rules booklet with updated Historical Notes&#10;    Two charts and tables booklets&#10;    One ten-sided die&#10;    Box and Lid&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The Soviets. flush with victory, thundered west towards Kharkov in an attempt to finish off the battered remnants of the German Army Group South.  Falling victim to the law of overstretch, the Soviets were badly surprised and beaten back through the strong leadership and superior strategy on the part of the Germans.&#10;&#10;If Stalingrad had determined that the Germans could not win the war, then the Battle of Kharkov led them to think they had not yet lost. From the Battle's results, each side drew vastly different conclusions. The Germans were determined to renew the offensive, to finish the uncompleted victory cut short by the thaw. The Soviets were determined to await the offensive, trap and immobilized the attacker, and then launch a massive counteroffensive of their own.&#10;&#10;With over 1000 playing pieces, four maps, two rule books and in depth briefing material including historical review, from the Winter Storm Campaign Series this operational level game is the sequel to Winter Storm: Decision at Stalingrad by Vanguard Games and covers the campaign for Rostov and Kharkov in February-March 1943.&#10;&#10;The system features detailed supply rules similar to OCS, weak ZOCs that show the potential of infiltration and the effect of terrain, and a flexible sequence of play to show the principles of mobile warfare.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 2 days&#10;Hex: 5 miles / 8 kilometers&#10;Units: Battalion to Corps&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: High&#10;Complexity Level: Medium&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 4-15&#10;&#10;",

But San Andreas is rather prone to earthquakes, which have a tendency to destroy the beautiful stretches of pavement you've been laying.

Scores aren't tallied until the end of the game, because at any time, earthquakes can occur, destroying tiles along the most-built direction leading out from the central &quot;San Andreas&quot; tile. Players constantly need to be claiming as many long roadways as possible while ensuring that their highways aren't the ones that are going to be destroyed if and when an earthquake occurs.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "BHARATA 600 BC is a multiplayer strategy board game set in the Indian subcontinent (Bharata) in 600 BC. This is the end of the Vedic period and the rise of the 16 Mahajanapadas (Great Kingdoms). Each player takes on the role of a Mahajanapada ruler, trying to make their kingdom the most predominant power in the ancient Bharata. Players get to decide how to lead their armies, gain and manage resources, and conquer territories to expand their kingdoms. At the same time, they have to protect their territories from rivals, natural disasters, and social events, such as riots. Players&rsquo; actions and achievements are rewarded with Victory Points that contribute to determining the game winner.&#10;&#10;Each player (or team) begins the game with a set of resources, two armies, and a different start location. In addition, players get to create their game avatars by choosing a combination of personality traits and abilities (variable powers), which can differ or be identical to other players&rsquo;. With each turn, players draw resources that are often linked to their previous decisions on resource pool management. Players may choose to convert their resources into Coins and use the Coins to increase their Army Strength or to conquer specific terrain types later in the game. Players use their two armies to move on the map, conquer territories through settlements or direct combat with other players, plan for attack or defence, gain regional resources and trade objects, and accomplish objectives. Events trigger natural disasters, diseases, or riots, which create an additional level of defence and resource planning. This is the time your ability traits become handy. They allow you to manoeuvre certain Events in your favour while at the same time, based on your play style, to make it harder on other players or the contrary, to help them out with their own Event scenarios.&#10;&#10;In BHARATA 600 BC, players have a great level of control over their play style and outcome. They can opt-in or out of a combat strategy, an objective-based strategy, a competitive or collaborative approach. As players find themselves in a dynamic game context, they have to adapt their strategy and choices to the evolving scenarios on the board.&#10;&#10;",

Use strategy and tactics to jump over as many play pieces as you can, and prevent other players from getting to the top first by bumping them down.&#10;&#10;Spin, Climb, Jump, Bump; Be First to the Top&#10;&#10;GAME MATERIALS&#10;- Game Board &ndash; Six multi-colored rotatable rings, with 12 colored squares each and a black, stationary top level;&#10;- 18 Pawns &ndash; Three of each in six different colors &ndash; red, orange, yellow, green, blue and white;&#10;- Deck of Cards &ndash; 42 playing cards, as follows:&#10;   - 36 cards in six different colors and numbered 1, 2 or 3,&#10;   - Three &lsquo;any-color&rsquo; wild-cards, and&#10;   - Three &lsquo;unlimited-spin and any-color&rsquo; wild-cards.&#10;&#10;OBJECT OF THE GAME &#10;Move all three pawns up the six rings and enter them all onto the top stationary 7th level.  First to do this wins the game. Second, third and fourth place winners follow continuing the game until the last pawn reaches the top level.&#10;&#10;PAWN MOVEMENT &#10;- Pawns always move by one, up down or sideways, but never diagonally;&#10;- Two pawns cannot occupy the same color square&#10;&#10;Jumping &#10;- A pawn can jump over or &lsquo;leapfrog&rsquo; any pawn;&#10;- The number of pawns in a row that you can leapfrog is unlimited, provided that the color card played is the same color as the square that the pawn lands on; and&#10;- Jumping can start from the first move onto the board and even onto the top 7th level.&#10;&#10;Bumping &#10;- If the square above, adjacent or below is occupied, then you can bump that pawn directly down two levels, by playing the color card of that square and moving your pawn to the occupied square;&#10;- If another pawn occupies the square that your opponent&rsquo;s pawn dropped down to, then that pawn also drops down two levels and so on (even if they happen to be your own pawns);&#10;- You cannot leapfrog up to bump an opponent&rsquo;s pawn down two levels; and&#10;- Bumping is only possible by moving up one level, sideways or even down, if you choose to do so.&#10;&#10;CARD PLAY&#10;There are three types of cards in the deck:  &#10;1. Numbered color cards are the main cards used in playing the game.&#10;&#10;RING ROTATION&#10;- The number on a card is the number of squares that you can rotate a ring, 1, 2 or 3 either clockwise or counter-clockwise, as shown on the cards;&#10;- You can only rotate the ring level that your pawn is on; and&#10;- Rotating is optional, you can play the card as a color only card, but if rotating, then move the ring the same number of squares as the number shown on the card and always rotate the ring before playing the color.&#10;&#10;COLOR PLAY&#10;- The color on the card is the only square color that you can move a pawn to, when played;&#10;- If after rotating a ring, the square color above where the pawn arrives is the same as the color of the card, then you can climb up to that square, bump another pawn or leapfrog to a higher square of that same color, in a combination move. If not, then play a second color card if you have the color match.&#10;&#10;2. Any-color wild-cards, allow you to move one pawn up, down or to an adjacent square from where your pawn is positioned, regardless of the color of that square:&#10; - The card also allows your pawn to climb, jump and bump, as explained in Pawn Movement above and to move up to the final 7th level;&#10; - This card cannot rotate any rings.&#10;&#10;3. Unlimited-spin, any-color wild-cards, allow you to rotate one ring (optionally) any number of squares clockwise or counter-clockwise, provided that you have a pawn on that ring:&#10;- The card is subsequently also played as an any-color card, as described above.&#10;&#10;COURSE OF THE GAME&#10;- Youngest player goes first;&#10;- Play one card per pawn move, starting off the board;&#10;- The square color on which you place your pawn must match the card color (wild-cards are any color);&#10;- Play all three of your cards in your hand, if possible;&#10;- You cannot bump another player off the bottom first level; and&#10;- After you have played as many of the three cards as you can play, your turn ends, you draw new cards for a total of three cards in your hand and the next player takes a turn.&#10;&#10;END OF THE GAME&#10;&#10;- From the 6th ring level, play any numbered card that matches the color of your pawns or any of the wild-cards to move up to the 7th safe level at the centre of the game board;&#10;- You can leapfrog over other pawns to make this move;&#10;- Your pawns cannot be removed, once they reach the top level; and&#10;- When all three pawns are at the top, you&rsquo;re done and if first to get there, you win the game.&#10;&#10;",

The actual underlying cause of the war was trading rights in the lucrative West Indies. After centuries of intermittent and reoccurring war between the English and Spanish, these two maritime powers had managed to work out a trade agreement that ended their conflicts but not their longstanding enmity. In April 1731, the captain of the Spanish caravel La Isabela intercepted and boarded an English brigantine (the Rebecca) near Jamaica that he suspected of being a smuggler. The brig&rsquo;s goods were looted and the English captain (Robert Jenkins) was consequently tortured throughout that day. When the Spanish captain (Juan Le&ograve;n Fandi&ntilde;o) hacked off Jenkins&rsquo; ear with a cutlass, he bridled, &ldquo;Go tell your king that the same will happen to him if he is caught doing the same.&rdquo; Beyond the bravado or even hubris that convoked such an utterance from el capit&aacute;n, it would reaffirm the old proverb, &ldquo;Death and life are in the power of the tongue&rdquo; because this flippant threat would indeed eventually reach the truculent King George II.&#10;&#10;Components: One 22&quot; x 34&quot; map &amp; 228 counters&#10;&#10;S&amp;T #308, Nov-Dec 2017&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "At the end of June 1862, the Confederate general Robert E. Lee, leading the Army of Northern Virginia defeated the Army of the Potomac, commanded by the Union general George McClellan during the Seven Days Battles, thereby saving Richmond. Having put an end to the Union&rsquo;s Peninsula campaign, Lee decided to put pressure on Washington and regain the initiative. Though outnumbered, he would do his utmost to avoid the junction of the Union armies in the Eastern Theater. His first target was the new and inexperienced Army of Virginia led by the Union general John Pope. Lee dispatched General Thomas J. &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson (victorious in the Shenandoah Valley Campaign of the previous winter)   to intercept the Union. The vanguard of both armies met in Culpeper County in Virginia. The Union general Banks positioned his artillery on the ridge near Cedar Mountain and a cannon battle ensued. The Confederate general Winder, leading the southerners, was mortally wounded in action, resulting in confusion and withdrawal for the south. Upon seeing this, Stonewall advanced the reserves and led the counter-attack himself. Faced with this unexpected wave, the Union line was broken and the soldiers retreated in disorder.&#10;&#10;As Jackson, will you be able to win the first battle of the Northern Virginia Campaign or will you change the course of history wearing Banks&rsquo; blue uniform?&#10;&#10;This game published in VaeVictis #153 uses the Civil War Brigade Battle system (Worthington Games).&#10;&#10;Scale:&#10;Complexity : 4/10&#10;Solo playability : 7/10&#10;Duration : 1 hour 30&#10;One turn = 40 minutes&#10;One counter = 1 brigade&#10;Scale : 200 meters&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Instead of delivering a fatal death blow that would give the Empire of Japan dominance of the Pacific region, the attack's ultimate consequence was to, in words attributed to Admiral Yamamoto, &quot;awaken a sleeping giant and fill him with a terrible resolve.&quot;&#10;&#10;In The Pacific War - From Pearl Harbor to the Philippines, two players face off in an epic struggle for control of the Pacific area of operations. In action from December 1941 to June 1944, the Japanese player uses his forces against the Allied forces from the United States, Great Britain, Australia and the Netherlands. Aircraft carriers, battleships, cruisers, and land-based aircraft are all involved. With them, each player plans and conducts strategies out of a limited hand of resourcey cards to gain the initiative and defeat his enemy's forces and control crucial ports and bases across the Pacific. The Japanese are at their strongest at the beginning, and the Allies gain power and resources each turn. Few would debate Japan's chances of victory, but the goal of The Pacific War is to see whether the Japanese forces can achieve better military gains and delay its defeat. Or can the Allies win a quicker victory? It's up to the players to utilize their assets to turn the tide of the war!&#10;&#10;Man, your battle station . . . It's time to fight The Pacific War!&#10;&#10;",

You may play as one of the warring vampire clans such as Ventrue, Tremere, Gangrel, or Toreador, or perhaps you'll choose to become one of the human factions fighting for their own desires, such as City Hall, the Mafia, or the Arcanum, with many more from which to choose.&#10;&#10;Additionally, the game integrates the story world of Vampire: The Masquerade by adding storyteller scenarios that add an optional narrative approach to the game. Players also gain disciplines, which give them powerful supernatural abilities unique to their character. Lastly, teams will choose their ambitions, which allow for multiple paths to victory, such as being bloodthirsty, manipulative, greedy, or somewhere in between.&#10;&#10;Blood Feud is dubbed a &quot;Mega Board Game&quot; because unlike a traditional board game, it isn't played at a single table. Blood Feud requires a large room or two separate rooms with 2-4 tables. One game table features the Cityscape and Orders, the map where players move their forces around the city and order them to fight and take control of important territories. The other game table features the Council and Market, where players use their best diplomatic and resource management skills to make sly trades, buy upgrades and player level-ups, and make large political decisions that will shape the destinies of teams to determine whether they win or lose! In order to win the game, teams earn victory points through the completion of legacies, which are secret objectives that can consist of all sorts of tasks and achievements  earned through gameplay.&#10;&#10;",

You have a Cue (upgradable) with a Power tracker as well as Chalk (needed for trickier shots). You can opt to apply extra power to reduce the shot difficulty, but both Cue Power and Chalk are limited resources that you'll need to manage.

    "description": "Blood on the Ohio presents the late 18th century struggle between a coalition of Indian tribes led by Little Turtle and the nascent American Army to determine control of the then Ohio territory. Known as the Northwest Indian War, Little Turtle's War and Washington's Indian War, this was the first major challenge to President Washington and his army following the conclusion of the Revolutionary War. Spanning from 1785 to 1795, the conflict grew out of a dispute over territorial boundaries following the war, aggravated by settlers flooding across the Ohio to claim Ohio lands then in possession of Native American nations.  The Miami and Shawnee were the principal tribes involved but in time they created a loose alliance with numerous other tribes and together they dealt the U.S. the worst defeat by Indians in the history of our Indian Wars. Washington sent three separate expeditions against them. The first two were handily defeated. The third and final expedition led by General &quot;Mad&quot; Anthony Wayne ended the conflict with his victory at The Battle of Fallen Timbers in 1794.&#10;&#10;This design is similar to King Philip's War. It is point to point movement, using a three dice simultaneous battle system with variable reinforcements on both sides, special action points, alliances and treaties, and frustratingly undependable American militia. The American army operates out of forts, the Indians out of villages. Every two turns both players enter into quartering which in effect resets the board. Destroyed Indian villages are relocated while additional forts and settlements may be built as the game progresses. Indians raiding is a quick and simple mechanism that adds color to the game.&#10;&#10;Four scenarios are included - one per expedition with a campaign game that encompasses all three. Low counter density with quick and tense game play.&#10;&#10;",

Each turn the top card will be flipped (starting with the Entrance) and players will face the specific encounter on the card. Thematically it could be anything from a Skeleton or Pit Trap to a Travelling Merchant.&#10;&#10;Players each have a hand of letter cards from which they will spell words with different points values (letters are worth varying points and some cards provide multiplication bonuses). If the encounter is a &quot;combat&quot; encounter, typically the player that can play the highest point word will win the encounter and claim the highest gold reward on the dungeon card, with other players claiming the second and third reward - however that is not always true as each dungeon challenge provides twists and turns; to the sorts of words that can be played. Other &quot;Special&quot; encounters might allow such actions as players to sell their letter cards for gold.&#10;&#10;The player with the most gold at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;",

Volume 1 will be Banish All Their Fears, covering the battles of Neerwinden, 1693 and Blenheim, 1704.&#10;&#10;- Neerwinden, July 29, 1693, War of the League of Augsburg.  Outnumbered and thoroughly out-maneuvered by the French army under the Duke of Luxembourg, British King William III refuses to retreat his Allied army over the river to his rear and instead elects to defend a stout breastwork line strongly anchored on fortified villages. Luxembourg has the cream of the French army at his command, and sees an opportunity to break the enemy defenses and possibly destroy the Allied army.&#10;&#10;-  Blenheim, August 13, 1704, War of the Spanish Succession.  Facing defeat in Spain, northern Italy, and along the Rhine, the Duke of Marlborough leads his Allied army deep into Bavaria and threatens to remove that key French ally from the war.  The French respond by sending an army under Marshal Tallard that links up with the Bavarians under Elector Max Emmanuel and stands to face Marlborough near the village of Blenheim on the banks of the Danube.&#10;&#10;Larger armies and the primacy of firepower mean significant changes for the familiar Musket &amp; Pike game system:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Larger armies.  Brigades became the primary battlefield maneuver element, and while retaining foot battalions and horse regiments as our unit scale, we've made brigades paramount. Shifting brigades between wings and committing them into action to take advantage of enemy mistakes was the essence of victory for the great commanders of the age, and we've built that into the game.&#10;     Supremacy of firepower.  Combat has been streamlined and simplified so that most unit combats are now resolved in 1 - 2 die rolls with decisive results.  Players will soon learn the importance of creating and using fresh reserves to bolster their shot-up frontline battalions.&#10;     Solid map and OOB research.  Nothing new here, the consistently high level of historical research that went into maps and OOB's in the Musket &amp; Pike series continues.  &#10;&#10;&#10;",

Players win an encounter when both sides of an Enemy Card are defeated by reducing the enemy&rsquo;s Strength and inflicting Wounds. Players and their characters will need to work together to weaken the enemy using their own attacks, which shifts the enemy&rsquo;s Strength from Stamina to Fatigue. This will Stagger the enemy, giving players the opportunity to inflict Wounds upon it. Enemies will harm characters by using both Strength and Rage cards.&#10;&#10;Players lose an encounter if all characters have been removed from the Encounter by having their Health Points (HP) reduced to 0 or have fully succumbed to corruption.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The Russian plan was to subdue the city with a massive show of force to intimidate its populace into submission. This approach had worked in 1991, and Moscow saw no reason why a repeat performance would not again suffice. Massive artillery and air support were not thought essential, as the long columns of tanks and their two battalions of mechanized infantry support were deemed sufficient to cower any who chose to witness.&#10;&#10;Alerted to the Russians' plan of entry, two battalions of Chechen resistance fighters flitted among the sewers and rooftops to greet the Russian force. Well-armed with RPG's and mortars and backed by snipers, the defenders deployed small groups of hunter-killer teams to tackle any armor encountered. A battle for the city was set.&#10;&#10;Players are cast in the roles of the commanders of each side's forces. Both players can brutally harm their opponent, while each has liabilities to protect. Opponents will be challenged to do as well, or better than, their historical counterparts.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 2 hours&#10;Hex: 100 - 150 yards / 62 - 137 meters&#10;Units: Infantry platoons, 2 tanks, 6 APCs&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 22 x 34&quot; full color map&#10;One dual-side printed countersheet (280 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 16-page rulebook&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: Medium&#10;Complexity Level: Low&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 2-4 hours&#10;&#10;",

Your base of operations is the USS Franklin D. Roosevelt on duty at Yankee Station. You play as a Navy pilot flying strike missions against targets in North Vietnam. Your goal will be to survive a mission or a campaign.&#10;&#10;The Skyhawk was a nimble aircraft and was capable of carrying slightly over four tons of&#10;ordnance. Depending on your target, the player has the opportunity to load out his aircraft to meet the mission requirements. The missions will not be easy. President Johnson and his civilian advisors may even change your target or ordnance loading depending upon the political situation in the USA.&#10;&#10;Facing you will be a determined North Vietnamese force. It is possible you will face small arms fire, AAA, SAM launches, and a rare encounter with a MiG.  You will have help. Support Forces allow the player to attack NV defense forces before you attack your target. Their success could make your job easier.&#10;&#10;The player may fly a single mission or play one of the three campaigns included in the game. These campaigns are:&#10;First Tour of Duty: Yankee Station: 10 August 1966 &ndash; 10 September 1966&#10;Second Tour of Duty: Yankee Station 20 October 1966 &ndash; 27 December 1966&#10;The third campaign combines the two campaigns above with additional rules.&#10;&#10;The game is not meant to be a detailed simulation of the Rolling Thunder campaign.

Can you Escape from Colditz Castle?&#10;&#10;1-6 players age 7+&#10;&#10;SINGLE PLAYER:&#10;The object of the Single Player game is to piece together one or more escape chains to allow a total of three Escapers (together or one at a time) a &lsquo;HOME RUN&rsquo; to freedom before the Guard draw pile runs out. The escape chains are achieved by forming a column of sequential cards in front of you numbered 1-4. Upon your third Escaper escaping, you win the game against the Guards! With an optional Expansion Pack 8 Escapers should be the target.&#10;&#10;MULTIPLAYER:&#10;The object of the Multiplayer game is to be the first to piece together one or more escape chains to allow a single Escaper a &lsquo;HOME RUN&rsquo; to freedom. You also play Action Cards against your opponents, stopping their own escape attempts. The escape chains are achieved by forming a column of 4 sequential cards in front of you numbered 1-4. Upon laying your HOME RUN card, you win the game against your opponents! Hints to help you on multi-player are shown on each card.&#10;&#10;CREATOR&rsquo;S NOTE:&#10;&#10;I prototyped this game after dreaming it up at Christmas. I scribbled it frantically on bits of card and played with my wife and kids (17 and 21). Brutal fun as someone commented is spot on.&#10;&#10;In the addictive multiplayer mode there was short-lived gloating at apparently strong hands, poker faces pretending a good hand, frustration, Intense rivalry between the kids, fist pumping joy and laughter at someone else&rsquo;s plight. Confiscating each other&rsquo;s cherished cards was contentious. The diversion cards being played out of turn were priceless double-crossing targeted at who has annoyed you the most and part of the joy and pain of playing with friends or family. I think in football they say there is no such thing as a friendly.&#10;&#10;The single player is a different game altogether. The black guard pack sits there silent and seems to know what you are planning, coming up with cards like it&rsquo;s been tipped of by a snitch. You dread the Inevitable Traitor card making his appearance. But then there is the joy of getting a good run going, tempered with wondering on the turn of each card whether your luck is about to come to an abrupt end. There are 14 escapers waiting in your pack and extension pack for a home run, and the first person to ever get all 14,  I would tell them to go buy a lottery ticket. They will command the luck of the gods.&#10;&#10;",

It may seem simple, but you really have to pay attention to which player is playing which card. It is an excellent opportunity for children to learn the basics of algorithm construction.&#10;&#10;During the game, we first place the participants of the running race in the specified places - princess, cook, knight, prince. Each player will receive a certain amount of program cards, which can be played to move characters in a certain direction. Caution! If we move with any character by running off the field from one of the sides, the game ends immediately and unfortunately we lost! This makes the game very exciting.&#10;&#10;The game can also be played with difficulty - the played program cards must be turned face down so that only the last played card is visible. With this, the memory can also be woven into the game. The game also comes with additional cards that can be used to add extra characters to the running race.&#10;&#10;The game can be won if the prince is first after the cards have been played, otherwise unfortunately the players have lost the game.&#10;&#10;",

Players roll their two dices and choose one of them to move around the track. When a player stops on a color they get a multiple choice question (or sometimes a mini game) of the appropriate category, delivered via app. If the player answers a question correctly two times in a row, they get a knowledge cup of that color (assuming they don't already have it). If they already have this colors cup, a correct answer allows the player to roll again and move on around the board.&#10;&#10;If a player stops at a space with an opponents pawn that owns this spaces color, he will challenge him in head to head questions to get the knowledge cup from him.&#10;&#10;Once a player has assembled all 9 knowledge cups or moved around the board three times, he is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

Your mortal enemy is just out of range, seething with lethal intent. Only one of you will walk away; only one will be victorious. Choose your weapons, test your mettle, and cross steel with your foe in a duel to the death.&#10;&#10;Clash of Steel is a tactical two-player card game of medieval duels. Every element of play is designed to explore the nuanced and complex decision-making of crossing blades, from choosing your stance to selecting your target.&#10;&#10;Gameplay focuses on managing your limited stamina, predicting your opponent's actions, and whittling their defenses down until you can land a final, crushing blow.&#10;&#10;The game takes about five minutes to learn and 10-15 minutes to play. There are no random elements -- the only unknown is which cards your opponent's playing and how much they're willing to spend to gain the upper hand.&#10;&#10;",

Flip fish, spend dice, add them to your collection - but beware of reveal and catch abilities that can have various effects on the game!&#10;&#10;Each fish, item and character has been meticulously hand-inked by illustrator Judson Cowan, then colored by hand in Procreate. It's an absolutely gorgeous world with many, many dark surprises to uncover.&#10;&#10;As your eyes spy more and more horrifying things, you'll collect Regrets cards - which drive up your madness but also give you access to more dice and increase the value of weirder fish. It's a risk/reward scenario as you balance your madness, knowing that at the end of the game the player with the highest value of Regrets will have to discard their most valuable mounted fish.&#10;&#10;Manage you resources, make strategic decisions, leverage madness to your benefit and suppress your Regrets as you try to catch the most valuable haul of weirder and weirder fish on this thrilling week at sea.&#10;&#10;SOLO MODE:&#10;In the solo mode (which you can also co-op), you'll act as an ichthyologist on a mission to catch and catalog every fish in the sea. Over a campaign of dozens of games, you'll try to reel in every last fish and document their attributes on provided catalog sheet. At the end of each game, you'll have to discard an equal value of fish to the regrets you've collected and may have to let some fish go to return to another day. At the end of the campaign, you'll have a catalog of all fish names, depths, values and difficulties that can be used by players in the multiplayer game to help identify what they might fish up!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

This task is easier for the French when only one army faces them. However, if Wellington&rsquo;s forces survive long enough for the Prussians to finally arrive, the tip of the scale will swing in favour of the Allies, and the French are probably going to find themselves fighting for their life.
