The game has an engaging strategy using dice based action selection and an extensive variety of cards. Immerse yourself in it's mythological theme as players deplete their enemy&rsquo;s health to win the battle.&#10;&#10;Summoners begin the battle with basic creature and spell cards. Creatures will gift the summoner with worshipers in the form of blue and red dice. The more creatures you summon, the more dice you will gain. Summoners build their army using the occult symbols on the dice. These symbols gain and activate spells, creatures, auras and curses from a common pool of cards.&#10;&#10;Spells are powerful actions like summoning mythical creatures and casting fireballs. Creatures can be used against an enemy to attack and defend. Auras can strengthen a summoner&rsquo;s army while curses hinder an enemy. Deplete your enemy&rsquo;s health to eliminate them and win the battle.&#10;&#10;Each turn is split into 2 stages: gain and combat. In the gain stage, the player gathers the dice earned by their creatures. They then roll these dice. In the combat stage, players can use the actions available to them on their cards in any order. These actions are cast, ability, and defend. When using these actions they must match the dice symbols or types of creatures on the card. They may end their turn at any moment during the combat stage. Play then continues to the next player. The game ends when one player's hp goes to 0 or below. That player is eliminated. The remaining player wins and is declared the greatest summoner.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Historically, it was the option Hitler elected against, putting political calculations ahead of military realities in his attempt to dominate Europe. This recasting of history assumes that Hitler made the defeat of Britain his top priority in 1940-41. Instead of angling for negotiations with His Majesty's government after Dunkirk, The Fuhrer issues orders to German High Command to take the war to the Commonwealth wherever it could. The one obvious target that is close at hand, and has considerable military and political value, is the Rock of Gibraltar, the gateway to the western Mediterranean Sea.&#10;&#10;Scenarios cover a July 1940 attack, the more probable December 1940 invasion, and a Spanish assault (with a little help from German allies).

    "description": "Not to be confused with Campaign, the identically named game produced by Wills and Hepworth in the 1940's.&#10;&#10;&quot;An exciting strategy game in which each player can become a Napoleon or a Wellington leading his army across Europe.  Famous battles can be re-fought and alliances can be made and broken with this compelling game of military and political strategy&quot;&#10;&#10;Large playing board in three sections, four sets of army pieces in red, white, blue and light green, comprising 1 General, 9 infantry and 9 cavalry units.  Six sets of 4 town cards of different colors, 4 alliance cards, 2 dice, 6 page rule book, and a 4 page &quot;The Years of Napoleon&quot; historical booklet.&#10;&#10;The game reproduces the Napoleonic wars at the strategic level in a very abstract fashion (all players are equal).  It can be won either by the outright defeat of your opponent, or (more likely) by acquiring towns controlling large areas of territory.  The board is an abstract representation of Europe and western Russia and is divided into six areas of roughly equal size representing France, Prussia, Russia, Austria, Italy and Spain.&#10;&#10;Each country has four provincial towns, and five of the countries used as starting countries also have a capital city.  Parts of the board, particularly the central area, have areas of impenetrable mountains, forests, and sea which restrict the movement of the troops.&#10;&#10;There are introductory and standard rules.  Normally, each player selects a country, but in the two player game each gets two countries except that the France + Prussia combo is not allowed.&#10;&#10;The pieces move using the dice, and combat is deterministic.  The throw can be used all on one piece or many pieces.  The full throw does not have to be used.  The pieces are placed in a set format on the country selected, with the General on the capital square and four infanty and four cavalry. The town cards are used to keep track of who controls what.&#10;&#10;The pieces move in set ways. The General moves one square in any direction. When it attacks it has a value of one and when defending a value of two. The General must be present to take a town.  Cavalry moves two squares at a time and must move horizontally or vertically but never diagonally.  Infantry moves one square and only diagonally.  Pieces cannot pass through opposing lines unless there is a clear gap of at least one square.&#10;&#10;Combat is like movement: one considers which pieces could be moved to the target piece's square and totals up the combat value --if large enough, the opposing piece is removed.  Only one piece can be attacked in a turn.  In the standard game, adjacent pieces also support each other (in a manner reminiscent of Diplomacy), which introduces a fair amount of tactics in on-going battles.&#10;&#10;Lost pieces are regenerated in your country's mustering area, forcing you to keep a constant flow of recruits towards the front.  In the standard game, the towns also represent logistical support --lose the town and you lose the corresponding piece.&#10;&#10;The odd movement system means you actually have two sets of cavalry and infantry pieces on the board, each set (which we could call &quot;odd&quot; and &quot;even&quot;) being unable to assist the other.&#10;&#10;A capital can only be captured after the provincial towns have been captured.  Where more than two players are playing you can agree to ally with another player and exchange alliance cards as reminders.  An ally cannot cross into his ally's territory without his consent.  Alliances can be broken simply by announcing the fact; you can attack your former ally on your next turn only, giving him a turn to re-deploy.&#10;&#10;The game is won if the player captures all his opponents capitals or captures 8 towns of any colour but not including the 4 in his own country.  You also win if your opponent's General is left with no troops.&#10;&#10;Campaign is basically a pure strategy game.  It you are in a position to attack a piece, you will take it.  However, there is some luck depending on how high a movement throw you have.&#10;&#10;from the Waddington ad for the game from 1976:   &quot;This absorbing strategy game captures the tension and the pressures of the famous Napoleonc battles. Alliances are made and broken and complex manoevers bring victory or defeat&quot;&#10;&#10;",

Beer flows freely, but not even the cellars of Byggvir, the God of Beer, could quench the thirst of Nordland's greatest warriors. Servants run for cover, knowing full well where all this is going. Suddenly an eerie silence fills the common room. On the table, only one full cup remains. Who will get the last drink? Not a single step back is allowed to the warrior who wishes to enter Valhalla. One single thought in everyone's mind: may Fenrir eat the sun, that beer will be mine! All vikings laugh at the thought of death, draw their war axes, joining the fight at the call of &quot;OOOODIIIIIIIIIIN!&quot;&#10;&#10;In Beer &amp; Vikings you are a fierce and thirsty viking warrior, willing to do anything to get the last cup of beer. The winner is the most drunk viking &ndash; in game terms, the player who has collected the most beer drink counters &ndash; at the end of the sudden death round.&#10;&#10;Be wary, though, for drinking too much will dull your wits and mastery with the war axe. Each drink of beer prevents you from using one of your resources, be it a weapon, an item, or even your personal skill! You must always be wary not to drink too much or you risk becoming a defenseless sot in the hands of your enemies. On the other hand, you will be able to burn up some of the beer you have drunk to obtain significant bonuses which may well save your life. Show yourself as the wise warrior you are and balance your strategy with care, not burning up too much beer, thus finding yourself in the rear at the end of the game, when the cup is empty and the sudden death round begins. Those who will succumb to their enemies' blows won't be eliminated from the game, but will become Spirits of Loki, the thirsty god of evil, and team up with the other Spirits to attack the living, aiming to steal their beer. Raise your glasses (and your axes)!&#10;&#10;Beer &amp; Vikings introduces 112 brand new cards! including a new type of cards called &quot;Valhalla&quot; which provide you a strong ability during the match &ndash; but to obtain them you need to kill an opponent. Thus, to gain this power you must generate a vengeful spirit first. Be careful when you follow the Valhalla way...&#10;&#10;Beer &amp; Vikings, a board game for 3-8 players about war axes, blood and beer, is both a standalone game and an expansion for Sake &amp; Samurai.&#10;&#10;Integrates with&#10;&#10;&#10;    Sake & Samurai&#10;&#10;&#10;Microbadge:&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Each player is a Summoner, bringing great characters from out of History in order to fight for the Holy Grail. But something has gone wrong with your Summoner powers, and you end up with a mix of parts from different heroes. You must combine them as best as possible and send them into battle.&#10;&#10;Each player puts together their fighter from body parts of legendary people. Each historical figure has been separated into three parts. Starting with a hand of 7 cards, each tries to form a historical figure by combining the right arm (red card), torso (green), and left arm (purple) cards. Each body part card also contains a third of the person's name and their achievement, like &quot;SOC / RA / TES&quot; and &quot;One of the founders of / Western philosophy and the first / Moral philosopher&quot;. Each card also has icons indicating its 'military power' and intellectual power'. There are also weapon cards (blue). The weapon might go on the right arm of the character.&#10;&#10;Before each round, a Holy Grail Piece card is drawn to indicate the victory condition of the current battle, such as 'higher intellectual power' and 'lower military power. In this way, the strongest one is not necessarily the winner.&#10;&#10;Players then take turns to draw and exchange cards between themselves until one player Summons up and announces their chimeric historical figure to enter the tournament, displaying their chosen limbs and torso. That player also announces their opponent. The battle begins when the chosen opponent has also summoned their hero. When the battle is over, the winner announces another player as their opponent and the loser discards their chimera.&#10;&#10;After each player has fought that round, the final winner claims the Grail card as their prize. Turning it over reveals the lower torso which is placed on their champion, to enter the Hall of Fame. The game edns when a player makes the required number of Hall of Fame heroes according to the number of players.&#10;&#10;The game is intended as a party game as much as a serious combat game. It is as much about making a chimera with a name and achievement that fits your sense of humour as about winning the actual tournaments. The game was an instant sell-out hit at the Tokyo Game Market in Autumn 2018.&#10;&#10;Publisher's summary&#10;In this game, the players are up-and-coming summoners skilled in summoning great historical figures. Once every ten years, the summoners gather at the battle tournament to win the holy grail.&#10;You have carefully prepared yourselves for the battle, but the Holy Grail has suddenly run out of control. Your summoning circles have all fallen to pieces, and you can only summon parts of unidentified historical figures. Still, the battle has already begun.&#10;&#10;Can you combine the parts of historical figures in your hand to create the most powerful one and win through the battle?&#10;&#10;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#229;&#176;&#134;&#230;&#157;&#165;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#156;&#159;&#229;&#190;&#133;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#132;&#170;&#231;&#167;&#128;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#229;&#143;&#172;&#229;&#150;&#154;&#229;&#163;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#229;&#129;&#137;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#143;&#172;&#229;&#150;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#190;&#151;&#230;&#132;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;10&#229;&#185;&#180;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#229;&#186;&#166;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#156;&#128;&#229;&#188;&#183;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#143;&#172;&#229;&#150;&#154;&#229;&#163;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#228;&#184;&#142;&#227;&#129;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#232;&#129;&#150;&#230;&#157;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#177;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#143;&#172;&#229;&#150;&#154;&#229;&#163;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#136;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#143;&#130;&#229;&#138;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;&#229;&#133;&#165;&#229;&#191;&#181;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#230;&#186;&#150;&#229;&#130;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#230;&#136;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#160;&#180;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#232;&#135;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#191;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#231;&#170;&#129;&#229;&#166;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#232;&#129;&#150;&#230;&#157;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#230;&#154;&#180;&#232;&#181;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;&#230;&#176;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#228;&#187;&#152;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#229;&#133;&#131;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#233;&#173;&#148;&#230;&#179;&#149;&#233;&#153;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#229;&#133;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#131;&#144;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#131;&#144;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#229;&#188;&#183;&#229;&#188;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#143;&#172;&#229;&#150;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#173;&#163;&#228;&#189;&#147;&#228;&#184;&#141;&#230;&#152;&#142;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#129;&#137;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#145;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;&#230;&#136;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#230;&#151;&#162;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#167;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#229;&#133;&#131;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#131;&#144;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#131;&#144;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#129;&#137;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#142;&#229;&#144;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#230;&#156;&#128;&#229;&#188;&#183;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#129;&#137;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#228;&#189;&#156;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#231;&#132;&#161;&#228;&#186;&#139;&#230;&#136;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#230;&#138;&#156;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#135;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#239;&#188;&#159;&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "In this anti-smoking game, the players try to accumulate money while avoiding addiction to cigarettes.  At the start of the game, each player picks a profession likely to benefit from the smoking of others (Doctor, Undertaker, etc.) and then starts moving around the board.  If a player lands on an advertising space, there's a chance that he or she will begin smoking.  When a smoker ends up sharing a space with another player, there's a chance he'll pawn one of his brand habits to him.  The more a player smokes, the faster they advance on the Life-O-Metre, which ends with death.  The game ends once the first player dies (in the short game) or when only one player remains alive (in the longer game).&#10;&#10;The game is extremely simple to play and is filled with all kinds of horrible (but sometimes amusing) puns.  The game's claim that it has the power to cause smokers to quit and to discourage people from ever picking up the habit is rather questionable, but since it's easy enough to be played by young children, its anti-smoking message might actually be able to reach an audience that hasn't heard it all before.  Unfortunately, the game's simplicity may well work against it; for some players, once all the jokes have been heard (and there aren't all that many), there's really not much reason left to play the game.  On the plus side, there's a lot of player interaction as your profession gets called upon or when you pass your cigarettes to another.&#10;&#10;Smokers Wild seems related to Drinkers Wild so it may have been originally published by Gamma Two.&#10;&#10;Similar to:&#10;&#10;    Drinkers Wild&#10;    Lovers Wild&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The slides are numbered one through thirty in the Milton Bradley editions and one through twenty-five in all other editions. each player or team chooses two numbered slides and reveal whatever items are beneath the slides. If the items match, then the items are removed to reveal parts of the rebus puzzle of which the team may hazard a guess. Solve the rebus puzzle and receive the value of all matching pairs possessed in play money. The side that has more money after three rebuses wins.&#10;&#10;Puzzles in the Milton Bradley and Endless Games editions were designed by the people who created them for the series: Norman Blumenthal for the former and Steve Ryan for the latter.&#10;&#10;Educational Concentration is made for classroom drills. It does not feature a rebus puzzle but it does have a plastic molded gameboard with twenty slots. The game comes with color matching, American history, American geography and homophone drills. More drills can be homemade easily.&#10;&#10;Based on the long-running television series which was inspired by the children's card game.&#10;&#10;",

During the game, all players must pay attention to what is going on around the table. Indeed, a player can, at any time, play a Mirror card and thus steal his opponents' turn. The Mirror card of a card is the one whose numbers are reversed compared to this card. For example, 73 is the Mirror card of the card 37. Playing a Mirror card allows you either to make all players draw or to get rid of a card! There is also a strategic aspect to the game, because when it is your turn to play, you play a card according to what was played by the previous player. For example, if I place my 02 (on which is indicated the sign -), the next player will have to play less than 02, which is very unlikely since the cards go from 01 to 98, forcing him again to draw a card.&#10;&#10;",

When 'Arch Rival' is rolled on the color die, one of the player's opponents is allowed to select the color of the required compartment. Players continue placing pieces in turn, until the point where arch can no longer support itself and collapses. The player who causes this to happen loses the game.&#10;&#10;",

It is played on the cells of a small hexagonal grid with an odd number of cells, and the goal is to have the most stones on the board when it is full. The board is initially empty. Rive was invented by Mark Steere in 2010.&#10;&#10;Definitions:&#10;A cluster is a connected set of stones in any combination of colors (only white, only black or both).&#10;&#10;There are three kinds of placement, all of which consist in placing exactly one stone of your color on an empty cell:&#10;You plant when you place adjacent to no clusters.&#10;You grow when you place adjacent to only one cluster.&#10;You merge when you place adjacent to multiple clusters.&#10;&#10;The only other kind of action is to shrink a cluster, which is to remove stones from it without splitting it into multiple clusters. This action will sometimes involve removing multiple stones, which may be of any combination of colors.&#10;&#10;The basic structure of a turn is this:&#10;You must plant if you can, otherwise you may grow or merge. If you merge, you must also shrink, then move again. This means that you may not end your turn before you have made a non-merging placement.&#10;&#10;Restriction on growing and merging:&#10;If you cannot plant (and therefore must grow or merge), you must choose a move such that the largest cluster you place adjacent to is as small as possible. This means that you cannot always choose freely between growing and merging, even though you aren't obligated to plant.&#10;&#10;Restriction on shrinking:&#10;The cluster resulting from the merging placement must be shrinked down to a cluster of size one more than the biggest cluster that was merged.&#10;&#10;",

After all of a player's board strips have been placed, they are limited to placing their game pieces on the boards already in play.

In the original game players draw one card from their deck and throw one card &ndash; but if they have the right icons in play, they'll draw more cards, throw more cards, steal cards from opponents and dump them in the gutter, break free of the shared playing space in order to keep from being covered, and &ndash; perhaps most important of all &ndash; score points each turn when they have enough visible icons in play.&#10;&#10;In this standalone expansion, players have the choice of 6 new factions that use a combination of the 6 existing and 6 all new abilities. Each of the factions plays very different from another. Some focus on skill (Wendy from Doomtown), and others focus on protection, reviving cards, and even bombs.&#10;&#10;There are also brand new land cards that offer special abilities.&#10;&#10;Integrates with:&#10;&#10;    Maximum Throwdown&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Life in a city flourishes for the inhabitants only when the magical ring is there.  Unfortunately, the ring never stays long in one place.  A band of brave knights is gathered together in Galad where they hear rumours that the ring has been seen in Tirad.  The Quest begins...&#10;&#10;Each player tries to find the ring and transport it to the cities.  As a reward, they receive the seals of these cities.  Collect three different seals to win.  Many obstacles are to be overcome and dragons slain before a knight's quest is complete.&#10;&#10;This is a fairly abstract game.  Each player has three extra &quot;lives&quot; and loses one when defeated by a dragon or when attacking another player.  These lives are replenished by visiting cities.  The ring allows its bearer some significant advantages such as passing through obstacles.  Special spots on the map allow new obstacles to be placed or existing ones to be moved, so a player can be affected even by other players far from him.  The end game can drag a bit as all the other players coordinate their efforts against the leader.&#10;&#10;",

Cowtown cards are always played on the table immediately in order to give the little dogies a place to settle.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you play a card from your hand onto a stack on the table. The card you play must be one higher than the top card on a stack. (Cowtown cards are effectively numbered 0.) If you can play multiple cards in numerical order &ndash; a Horn-to-Tail Sequence &ndash; you can do so; in addition (or alternatively) you can play multiple cards with the same number &ndash; a Stampede &ndash; onto different stacks when those stacks have the same lower number. Playing a three-card Horn-to-Tail Sequence or a Stampede is worth 1 &quot;scorecow&quot;.&#10;&#10;Whenever you play a card of matching color onto a stack, you're safe, but if you play at least one card of a different color &ndash; a bullish play &ndash; then you must draw and discard the top card of the deck. If that card shows a red bull's eye, then you've been kicked and must draw a card. Lay a 10 on a stack and you close that barn, getting to take another turn or pass one of your cards to another player.&#10;&#10;The round ends as soon as one player is out of cards or the deck runs out. The player with the fewest cards earns 4 scorecows, the player with the next fewest 2 scorecows, and everyone other than the player with the most cards earns 1 scorecow.

Items are obtained from various shops and are also bought and sold in the marketplace, in exchange for shillings or in trade for other items.  Along the way, various events in history shake things up.  Players visit the many different buildings in a colonial American town (tavern, inn, jail, church, etc.) and find ways to strip other players of their belongings and negotiate trade.  When one player collects all the items on his or her list and ends the game, the player with the most assets becomes the winner.&#10;&#10;Rules contain 3 different levels of difficulty so that the game can be tailored to different age groups (Ages 8 and up, Ages 10 and up, and Ages 12 and up).

By means of committing burglary you can get trophies and gadgets that are essential to win the game. They also help you in overcoming challenges of the game as well as give you an opportunity to harm your  opponents. By shooting at rivals or dueling with them you can steal their chosen trophies but you may also lose yours.&#10; Mechanics of the game is based on modified roulette rules. Players bet the result on a special even/odd table and a number table (1-36). The probability of failure is small &ndash; only 25% - and can be further  reduced  by means of some gadgets. The esthetic wooden roulette is attached to the game.&#10; In order to smooth down certain randomness that accompanies burglaries, shoots and duels, so called task cards were introduced to the game. There is a different task for each round and after accomplishing it a player receives prize in the form of trophies and gadgets. Fulfilling the task depends solely on player&rsquo;s behavior.&#10; The game board is based on a tile system. Players arrange it themselves and each time they compose a different district in which the game takes place.&#10; Abetto game provides large interaction between players and a great deal of emotions.
