Number disks from 1-50 are shuffled, and one is drawn.  Players race to find three tiles whose equation (first times second, plus or minus third, or any other combination of two tiles multiplied and the other added or subtracted) adds to that total.  The first to do so wins the disk.  Whomever has the most disks when they are all claimed wins the game.&#10;&#10;Nominally the game is for 1-6 players, although the upper bound is arbitrary and the rules say nothing about how the game might be played solo. Possible solo challenges involve seeing how many tokens you can claim in a set time (e.g. 10 minutes total) or how many tokens you can claim racing against a countdown timer (e.g. 5-10 seconds per token).&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "NOW AVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE: https://bluegeargames.square.site/product/pre-order-knights-of-glory/6&#10;&#10;THE STORY&#10;~~~~~~~&#10;A long time ago, kings, knights, and peasants all lived for a common purpose: kings ruled the land, peasants served their king, and knights defended their kingdom. Beyond the seas, beyond the woods, and beyond high mountains was a fortress ruled by a stern and powerful king. This stronghold was unbreakable and the king's army was undefeatable.&#10;&#10;Every year the king held an event called &quot;The Royal Games&quot; for his noble subjects to train to become highly skilled knights. Beneath this fortress lay a dungeon used to test their wits and strength. These knights faced rigorous obstacles including traps, weaponry, and psychological tactics. Only the most resilient knights prevailed. Whoever was worthy during the treacherous journey earned the rank among the king's elite.&#10;&#10;&#10;OBJECTIVE&#10;~~~~~~~&#10;In Knights of Glory, you play as one of the king&rsquo;s knights seeking the ultimate goal of becoming a Royal Games victor. Advance through a treacherous dungeon through the art of bluffing. Each player will try to make their way to the exit through deception and deduction. More than one knight may prevail. Exit the dungeon to win the Royal Games and become Elite Knights.&#10;&#10;&#10;TURN OVERVIEW&#10;~~~~~~~~~~~&#10;The most experienced knight will play first. Play then proceeds clockwise around the table, with each player taking a series of actions until the game ends.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, the first player will take the Rook piece. A game of Knights of Glory is played over several rounds, each consisting of three phases:&#10;&#10;Action Phase&#10;Voting Phase&#10;Refreshing Phase&#10;&#10;&#10;TURN IN DETAILS&#10;~~~~~~~~~~~&#10;&#10;ACTION PHASE&#10;&#10;1) Pass - Pass your turn to next player in the rotation. This will end your turn.&#10;&#10;2) Discard - Discard your Weapon cards face-down up to or equal to the Tier Level  you are currently on. This will end your turn. Example: If you are on Tier 2, you may discard up to 2 cards. All discarded cards will be placed in a pile known as the &ldquo;Discard Pile.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;3) Advance - Advance by looking at the Destination card ahead of you. If the card is face-down, reveal it by flipping the card over to see what trap you must overcome. Roll as many Weapon dice as shown on the Dice Indicator  and play a Weapon card or KOG token for each dice. If you were successful after the Voting Phase, you may decide whether to push your luck and perform one of your turn actions again.&#10;&#10;VOTING PHASE&#10;&#10;Players will vote to determine if your play was the truth or a lie. If you were telling the truth and Players disagree, you will reveal your Weapon Cards and advance as normal but Players that disagree will retreat back to the previous Destination card. If you were bluffing, you will reveal your Weapon Cards and retreat back to the previous Destination card and Players that disagreed will advance to the next Destination card. Players who agree will do nothing. If all Players agree you will not reveal your cards.&#10;&#10;REFRESHING&#10;&#10;When the last player&rsquo;s turn ends, it is time to start the new round. The player in last place on the Destination Cards is now the first player in the new round and will claim the Rook.Players will keep any remaining cards that they still have. It is time to replenish every player&rsquo;s hand back to 5 cards again.&#10;&#10;&#10;GAME END&#10;~~~~~~~&#10;&#10;There may be more than one winner. When a player successfully arrives to the Exit Path, they are considered the winner, but other players have a chance to win as well and play one final turn. The game continues, starting with the next player in the rotation.&#10;&#10;Each time a player successfully advances to the Exit card, the Journey Paths will gradually collapse starting with the Cell, Start, and all of Tier-1 together; and then, when another player wins, Tier-2; and finally, Tier-3. If players are standing on a collapsed Destination card, they are eliminated from the game.&#10;&#10;When all the Tiers collapse or the last player fails to exit, the game then ends, and players that successfully advanced to the Exit card are considered the winners as well.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "This year, 2017, marks the 20th birthday of Splotter as a company. We started in 1997 by going to the Essen games fair, not knowing what to expect. We had 20 handmade copies each of 3 simple games, in videoboxes. We sold about half of them. Since then, we have come a long way! We wanted to celebrate this history somehow with our fans. We considered printing T-shirts or making a book about our history, but we felt a game to be more appropriate!&#10;&#10;KIEK, 20 years of Splotter is a special anniversary edition of the game KIEK. Kiek was originally developed in 1997 and published in 1998. As a game, it is much, much simpler than what we design these days. We are republishing it as a fan edition to celebrate Splotter's 20th anniversary.&#10;&#10;KIEK, 20 years of Splotter features pictures of our games, prototypes and prizes made by our long-time friend, game photographer Henk Rolleman; in addition, we have added a number of historical photo's from Splotter's past. Although it is playable as a game, it's mostly fun if you've been following Splotter for a while. As we feel this is more a fan item than a Splotter game, we have printed a very limited quantity only.&#10;&#10;The game was announced as a special surprise at Essen 2017. And yes, the box has a flavour text:&#10;&#10;The key turns slowly in the heavy door. The lady leading the way lowers her voice: &quot;We are now about to enter the Splotter vault. It contains all the games they published in the past 20 years; those they didn't; prototypes, game pieces, demo games. Please be very careful, because everything is exactly where it needs to be.&quot;. The door opens, and it reveals.... &quot;Joris!!!&quot; (she is shouting now), &quot;you promised to clean up all this old Splotter junk!&quot;. Everything is everywhere... can you help to sort out 20 years of Splotter history?&#10;&#10;KIEK, 20 years of Splotter is a re-edition of a game we published in 1998 (the second year of Splotter). It is also a set of 60 pictures that celebrate our Splotter years, the people who make and made Splotter to what it is now, and of course, all of our games. Be aware thatKiek is a completely different type of game from the ones that we publish today: it is short and simple. We invite you to see it more as a Splotter memorabilium than as a Splotter game. Or, if you like our set of rules, use them with your own set of pictures!&#10;&#10;Changes from the first edition: made-up categories like &quot;non-blue&quot; etc. are no longer allowed (unlike in the earlier edition). It also has double the amount of photos, all new and with a common theme.&#10;&#10;",

Use your familiars to gather ingredients and cast spells on the villagers to achieve goals and score victory points as you vie to be named the village crone.&#10;&#10;All the players are witches who have come upon a medieval village without a crone. They send out familiars to gather ingredients they can use in spells to complete Witch's Scheme cards. Each of the cards is worth 1, 2, or 3 points, which also indicates how difficult the scheme is to complete. The witch who scores 13 points wins.&#10;&#10;The village consists of 6 location game boards: village green, lord's manor, farm, mill, forge, and tithe barn. The locations are modular and can be placed in any order or configuration as long as the gridlines line up. (The easiest way to play is with a 3x2 retangular configuration.)&#10;&#10;The villagers, who are the most frequent targets of the Witch's Schemes, have starting locations. The peasant begins in the village green, the lord in the lord's manor, the farmer in the farm, the miller in the mill, the blacksmith in the forge, and the priest in the tithe barn.&#10;&#10;The ingredients can be found at 4 of the 6 locations. Silver is in the lord's manor, soil in the farm, flour in the mill, and fire in the forge. There are also 3 eye of newt cards in each stack of ingredients and can be used as wild cards in spells.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, each player is dealt 1 of each of the 3 levels of Witch's Scheme cards. Consulting their Books of Spells (which are the same for each witch) to determine which ingredients will be needed to cast the spells on their Witch's Scheme cards, they put 1 familiar in the village green, take turns placing 2 additional familiars in other locations, and draw 2 ingredients from those locations.&#10;&#10;The first step in the order of play is to tithe. As soon as each player knows which ingredient they will sacrifice, they place it facedown in the tithe barn. This seeds the tithe barn with ingredients that can be gleaned with the Fortune spell (which allows a player to draw any 3 ingredients from the tithe barn). However, any player who placed a familiar in the tithe barn does not have to tithe.&#10;&#10;Then, in turn order, players may move their own familiars and/or villagers and cast spells. (Spells may be cast for strategic or tactical purposes as well as to complete Witch's Schemes.) The movement is limited to a total of 6 spaces, and the number of spells is limited only by the ingredients the player has. The movement and spellcasting can be in any order on a player's turn. A player can even intersperse movement and spellcasting. If a player completes a Witch's Scheme, the card is turned over so that the other players can clearly see how many points that player has. After he/she is finished moving and casting spells, he/she draws 1 of each of the 3 levels of cards, reads them, and decides which one(s) to add to his/her hand as replacements.&#10;&#10;When all players have finished moving and casting spells, the players harvest 2 ingredients for each familiar in a location, and the broom (which indicates the first player) is moved clockwise.&#10;&#10;The spells are Conjuring (to add up to 2 more familiars into play), Love (to join the fates of 2 villagers, meaning spells cast on one affect the other and movement of one moves the other), Transformation (to turn a villager into a frog or vice versa), Binding (to lock a location down and prevent anyone or anything from entering or leaving a location), Switching (to change the place of 2 familiars and/or villagers), Summoning (to cause a villager to move to a location containing one of the player's familiars), Fortune (to allow a player to draw any 3 ingredients from the tithe barn), and Protection (to block a spell cast by another player). 1 silver can also be used to complete a Scheme out of turn or to discard and draw a new Witch's Scheme card. Each spell requires not only ingredients but also an incantation, which is provided in the Book of Spells. Alternatively, players can make up their own incantations. If a player is caught trying to complete a spell without speaking the incantation, the spell does not work.&#10;&#10;Each witch has access to the same number of starting familiars, the same ingredients, the same spells, and 3 Schemes of the same level. But the witch who most cleverly uses these resources to reach 13 points is named the village crone.&#10;&#10;The Village Crone also includes rules for solitaire play.&#10;&#10;",

Each turn represents the passage of one week.&#10;&#10;During the game, players draw cards representing purchase orders (POs) for different types of attractions. These cards have two uses: first, as POs approved by the finance office to expedite construction of specific types of attractions each turn, and second, as the actual financing to construct the attraction represented on the card. At the end of each month, the review board meets, evaluates the progress of each neighborhood, and awards bonuses for meeting a set of predetermined preferences. These preferences relate to how attractions in a park are arranged. Points are awarded to the players who meet the review board's preferences.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, the owners of the facility come in and award points to the finished themed neighborhoods. These points are awarded based on four criteria:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Excitement Level &mdash; size of the rides&#10;    Parking Lot View &mdash; curb appeal to visitors upon arrival&#10;    Main Entrance View &mdash; attractiveness to patrons waiting in line for their tickets&#10;    Themed Attractions &mdash; number of matched types of attractions in a neighborhood&#10;&#10;&#10;The player who earns the most points wins the design contract for the owners' next project.&#10;&#10;",

The game has been copied by many companies since and is the most widely available of all 3D Chess boards.&#10;&#10;The most famous variant of 3D Chess appeared in the Star Trek television show in 1966, in which it was referred to as 'Three Dimensional Chess'.&#10;The original stage property was designed by Irving A Feinberg and consisted of three 4x4 boards and four movable 2x2 boards.&#10;It was developed into a real game by the technical designer Franz Joseph Schnaubelt in his 1975 book, the Star Fleet Technical Manual and improved by a fan and chess player Andrew Bartmess, whose rules are some of the most popular.&#10;Fans of Star Trek still call it 'Three Dimensional Chess' but players of the game call it by the title Schnaubelt popularised 'Tri Dimensional Chess'.&#10;&#10;In 1985, the game design Gary Gygax published rules for Dragon Chess in Dragon magazine.&#10;A Dragon Chess board is three 8x12 boards stacked up and includes the extra pieces: Sylph, Griffon, Dragon, Warrior, Oliphant, Unicorn, Hero, Thief, Cleric, Mage, Paladin, Dwarf, Basilisk and Elemental.&#10;&#10;Max Chappell started designing Hyperchess in the early '70s but didn't produce and sell the first commercial set until 1996.&#10;Although it was influenced by the tri dimensional chess board, it has been described as more helical in design.&#10;&#10;In 2001 William d&#039;Agostino recreated the Strato Chess board and called it Millenium Chess, with the idea of extending Classic Chess, whithout distorting the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "With fifty-five sturdy picture/question cards, My First BrainBox is a game that can be used for many years, in many ways. For a very young child each charming illustration can be a springboard to developing fundamental observation skills. If you don&rsquo;t know what to ask, use the questions on the back as your basic starting point. Designed especially for pre-readers, there are no words on the fronts of the cards, just child-friendly images.&#10;&#10;The next step would be to have your children study the picture and tell you a story about it. This develops their imagination and logic skills as they strive to make sense of the unknown. Then, as your child matures, he will be ready to develop both his short and long-term memory, so challenge him to recall the details after he has studied a card for ten seconds. A die is rolled, and if your child can answer the corresponding question on the back of the card, the card is his. This will encourage his visual memory and even his auditory processing skills. You know how deficient young children can be in both arenas, and you will hard-pressed to find another program that addresses these needed proficiencies in such an effortless manner.&#10;&#10;BrainBox games develop both short and long term memory by challenging children to recall what they saw. Players study a game card for 10 seconds trying to memorize a variety of features. A die is rolled and if the player can answer the corresponding question, the card is his. Play until one child has won a set amount of cards or play until all cards are acquired.&#10;&#10;",

It is said that whoever finds these Tomes, can control magic itself.&#10;&#10;Classic trick taking action, with a magical twist! Tome is a fresh take on the age old genre. In the normal mode, 4 players are split into 2 teams where teammates sit across from one another. Teams compete for points each chapter (trick) by playing 1 spell (card) to see who can win victory for their team. 3-4 Players can also square off against one another in survival mode, to see who is tough enough to be the last one standing.&#10;&#10;Trump is not stagnate each round, but constantly changing each chapter. After each player is dealt 6 spells, the remaining spells are set in the center to form the Element Deck. Each chapter, a Title Spell is revealed from the top of the Element deck. The Element of the Title Spell determines what Element is trump for that chapter.&#10;&#10;Each spell has a unique effect that can be used to shift the game in your favor. Weakening your opponents spells, powering up your own, or even changing trump! In order to gain the true power of a spell rules must be followed. Following suit is not required in Tome, a player can play any spell from their hand on their turn. When the lead player plays a spell, they begin a Chain in that Element. The next player can play a spell of the same Element to continue the chain and gain the effect of their spell. If a player plays a spell with a different Element, the Chain is broken and their spell is silenced and has no effect.&#10;&#10;Within the Tome deck there are also spells of a Special Element. These spells all share a similar property. They do not start nor break a Chain, and their magic cannot be silenced. However there is a trade off: A special spell cannot be trump.&#10;&#10;In survival mode, each player is on their own. Players begin a round with 2 health, then the player who plays the weakest spell each chapter loses a health. When a players health reaches 0, they are out of the round and each surviving player score a point.&#10;&#10;Tome is built to be a modular game. Switching in different Elements changes up the strategy and will ensure that each game is fresh and exciting!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Landing in one of six eras, the crew needs to democratically decide which members are best equipped to repair spacetime by returning beings to their appropriate eras, or create a chain reaction of paradoxes to sow more chaos through time!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Zombie House Blitz is a speed card game in which players try to save members of their family from zombies by getting people (cards) out of the house (stack) and into the cars (points piles) to safety. Players don't take turns, but rather race madly to get their cards into the shared scoring piles in the center of the table.&#10;&#10;Each round of the game, players start with a stack of cards (their house) and three face-up cards (escape routes) next to them. When everyone is ready, play begins with each player flipping cards from his draw deck. Any face-up cards can be moved into the scoring area as long as they can be placed on top of a card of the same suit in ascending order (1-6). Once all the cards in a player's house stack are gone, the round ends. Players score points for family members who escaped (made it to the scoring area), but lose points for people eaten by zombies.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "(from S&amp;T press website:)&#10;&#10;On 3 July 1866 the armies of Austria-Hungary and Prussia met west of the Bohemian fortress of K&ouml;niggr&auml;tz (now Hradec Kr&aacute;lov&eacute;). The battle was the culmination of a quarter-century of political and military maneuvering by Otto von Bismarck, aimed at enabling Prussia to supplant Austria-Hungary as the dominant state of the coalescing German nation.&#10;&#10;The battle is presented using the folio line&rsquo;s Musket &amp; Saber system: brigade-sized units, one-fifth-mile hexes, 90-minute turns, 280 counters. The Austro-Hungarian army, chastened by a week of minor defeats, was entrenched a long line covering the fortress of K&ouml;niggr&auml;tz. It occupied a central position facing three converging Prussian armies. To win, the Prussians must sweep the Austrians off the field (as they did historically), while the Austrians must maintain a presence on the field to justify their continued claim to political primacy. The game emphasizes the differences between the armies in doctrine, weapons and morale. The Prussian triumph was born of more than just the famous needle-gun: their infantry used flexible organization and tactics to mass men quickly at the decisive point, while the Austrians used a throwback to Napoleonic column formations due to a misreading of the lesson from an earlier engagement. The Prussian artillery is outclassed by the superb Austrian guns, but can be dangerous if used properly. The Austrian cavalry is superior as well, but horsed charges were already an anachronism. In the end the battle came down to crucial command decisions, giving both players an opportunity to win.&#10;&#10;Components: One 22&quot; x 34&quot; map &amp; 280 counters&#10;&#10;Magazine: Strategy &amp; Tactics #275&#10;&#10;",

President Bush is not an hampered, and immediately sends in the 29th Light Division to take the Strait, hold it, and wait for reinforcements. &#10;&bull; Can the Light Division stop the Iranian Revolutionary Guard? &#10;&bull; Will Gorbachev's Red Army invoke the mutual support treaty and come to the aid of their 'friends&quot;? &#10;&bull; And, finally, will the 82nd Airborne get to the Strait in time?&#10; Light Division is an advanced game, for two players, depicting a hypothetical conflict in the near future.&#10;&#10;CONTENTS: &#10;1 32 page rule book &#10;1 full color map &#10;400 die cut counters &#10;1 ten sided die &#10;1 plastic tray&#10;&#10;Players: 2&#10;Playing Time: 3-6 hours&#10;&#10;(from the back of the box)&#10;&#10;&#10;Operational game of modern combat in Middle-East Gulf area, with the U.S. Rapid Deployment Force attempting to secure the Strait of Hormuz following its closure by Iran.

The board is a simple 11 by 11 square grid.&#10;&#10;The players are attempting to form the largest formation in each of the four different types:&#10;&#10;    O = A rectangle occupying all exterior spaces of the rectangle (meaning there can be a hole or even filled with a friendly or opposing piece).&#10;    L = An L shaped formation (horizontal and vertical - not diagonal) with each leg having at least 3 spaces.&#10;    I = Any horizontal or vertical line of spaces of at least four spaces long.&#10;    X = Any diagonal line of at least four spaces long.&#10;&#10;&#10;Adjacent to the board is a scoreboard showing the lowest possible values for each formation:&#10;&#10;    O = 4, 6, 8, 9&#10;    L = 5, 6, 7, 8&#10;    I = 4, 5, 6, 7 &#10;    X = 4, 5, 6, 7 &#10;&#10;&#10;The player with the largest O, L, I, or X, marks its value on the scoreboard. If both players are tied for the largest formation of a type, both mark their scores on the scoreboard.&#10;&#10;The game ends when either player has an automatic win or when they concede that no further higher scoring formations can be made. The board should be about 66% full at this point and there simply won't be room for any higher scoring formations to be placed. The winner is the first player to form a formation larger than the scoreboard can handle (an automatic win), or at the end of game, the player who won more scoring columns than their opponent, wins. Ties are broken by the player with the furthest advanced scoring marker.&#10;&#10;Originally published in spielbox magazine.&#10;&#10;",
