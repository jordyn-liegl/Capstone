    "description": "The year is 1886 in a small forgettable hovel of a town on the border of nowhere. Several unscrupulous individuals come together for a hand of poker over a pile of cash. A whispered accusation of chicanery crosses the table and irons are yanked from holsters. The sparse crowd dives for cover and lead arcs towards flesh, the saloon aching for a fresh coat of crimson.&#10;&#10;A Fistful of Dinero, the first game published by Magic House Games, is a card game for 3-6 players set in the wild west. After a poker game goes terribly wrong, players draw their weapons, make a quick grab for the cash, throw chairs, dive for cover, and do everything they can to be the richest gunslinger &mdash; or just the last man standing...&#10;&#10;At the start of a round, players draft cards and place (program) them in one of three slots. Then in player order, players reveal the first slot and take one of the two available actions. Players can fire their weapons, hide beyond cover, switch weapons, grab money, etc. Players also have the opportunity to &quot;throw&quot; chairs or other items (cards) onto an opponent's player board to do additional damage.&#10;&#10;The game ends in two ways: If a player takes five points of damage, he's dead and out of the game, with the last man (or woman!) standing winning it all. Alternatively, if the pot of dinero ever runs out, the richest outlaw wins.&#10;&#10;Highlights Include:&#10;-Card Drafting with Conflict&#10;-Action Programming&#10;-Completely unique cover system based on seating location&#10;-Literally throw chairs, tables, knives, tomahawks, and dynamite at your opponents by physically tossing cards&#10;-Descriptive wounds with story flair and lasting repercussions&#10;-Intense narrative that unfolds organically from actions performed (heavily inspired by the classic Avalon Hill game Gunslinger)&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Dissatisfied with the Mexican President&rsquo;s decision to halt all payments on foreign debts until the Mexican economy improved, a coalition of European Powers that included the French Empire, Spain and Great Britain agreed to send an expeditionary corps to capture the main port of Vera Cruz and hold it until debt payments were restored. The British and Spanish monarchs did not reckon with the ambitions of Napoleon III, nephew of Napoleon Bonaparte and Emperor of the French. The wily Napoleon III schemed to conquer Mexico and set up a puppet regime that would bleed Mexico of its treasures to finance a resurgent French Empire.&#10;&#10;Napoleon III picked an obscure Austrian archduke named Maximilian to be his cat&rsquo;s-paw and supported the effort with thousands of French troops. Even though there was some local support in Mexico for the return to a monarchy, most of the country remained loyal to the elected president, Benito Juarez and the French spent huge amounts of treasure and blood to try to put down the Republican Forces. From 1862 through 1866, Napoleon III and his puppet Maximilian attempted to forge a Mexican Empire, but after the United States won its Civil War, the threat of an invasion from the North and growing concerns about the ascendancy of the Prussian military in Europe forced Napoleon to withdraw his army from Mexico. The remaining troops loyal to Maximilian were not enough to stop the growing Republican army, and Maximilian was captured and executed in 1867.&#10;&#10;Can you, as the French/Imperial Mexican player succeed where Napoleon III failed and pacify a hostile land? You have some of the finest units in the French army, including the famed Foreign Legion, volunteers from Austria, Belgium and Egypt, and a growing army of loyal Mexicans at your disposal. Or, as the Republican Player, can you outwit the powerful French army and restore Mexico to its rightful ruler, Benito Juarez?&#10;&#10;Design - Andy Nunez&#10;Development - Paul Rohrbaugh&#10;Graphic Design - Craig Grando&#10;&#10;",

The Italian units, particularly the Savoia Grenadiers, fought so well the Commonwealth forces had to conduct three assaults to break their position. Indeed, the Savoia Grenadiers were never dislodged from their hilltop position, and were only compelled to surrender after being surrounded an after the other Italian positions had fallen. In spite of their ultimate defeat, it&rsquo;s regarded as one of the Italian Army&rsquo;s most impressive showings during the entire war.&#10;&#10;Keren includes one counter sheet (228 counters) and one map of the Keren area of Eritrea (each hex represents about 220 yards), portraying the Dongolaas Gorge and the heights on both sides, dominating the area south of Keren. The system&rsquo;s unique feature is the ability of infantry units to self-reduce to dispatch men as supply-runners, as was necessary for both sides historically. Fighting atop the difficult hills will give players a sense of why the Italians were so difficult to dislodge, as well as the importance of artillery and air support, and the limitation on the usefulness of tanks.&#10;&#10;Components: One 22&quot; x 34&quot; map &amp; 228 counters&#10;&#10;Magazine: World at War #25&#10;&#10;",

For fear of raids, the Spaniards hadn't dared to send a single one of their silver ships over to the motherland. The War of the Spanish Succession with Great Britain and the Netherlands had made shipping routes too unsafe.&#10;What was now being transported on the ships of this armada was the most precious cargo that has ever been entrusted to the seas: the ships had loaded gold and silver bars worth the equivalent of 86 million dollars. The ships also had three iron-studded chests on board, filled to the brim with priceless jewels.&#10;&#10;The chests were intended for the future wife of the Spanish king, Duchess Isabella of Parma.&#10;&#10;On July 29th, the fleet passed the Bahamas and headed for what is now Cape Kennedy. During the night the waves suddenly increased and a hurricane drove the ships towards the reef-strewn coast. On the morning of July 31, 1715 the storm was over. Hundreds of corpses lay among gold bars, silver coins and cannons on the Florida coast.&#10;&#10;Using cards and a log puzzle deduction grid, players try to match , the captain, ship, cargo and depth of wreck for ships from the fleet.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Fleet 1715: Expansion&#10;&#10;&#10;",

If a player wants to penetrate a city, he or she can ask another player to join the heist. The main player and the collaborator roll the dice, and the heist succeeds if any one of them rolls all &quot;success&quot;. The main player takes the valuable object from the city while the collaborator receives points for compensation. If the heist fails, both the main player and the collaborator receive an investigation token (potential penalty points).&#10;&#10;Players continue to gather valuable objects, which can be sold for immediate points or displayed to claim &quot;fame titles&quot;.  Whoever earns the most points wins the game and is declared the greatest thief of the world.&#10;&#10;",

Guide the bouncy balls into your goal by adding and pivoting bumpers on the Bumparena board. But watch out! When the balls start to fall, you never know which way they'll roll. The first player to score six goals wins.&#10;&#10;Bumparena combines the high-energy excitement of pinball with the strategic challenge of a 3-D maze. No two games are the same, but each one is full of laughter and suspense. Quick and easy to play, Bumparena is perfect for any occasion, and although it's designed for kids 7 and up, everyone will enjoy its unpredictable fun.&#10;&#10;The object of Bumparena is to be the first player or team to score six goals. Take turns drawing and playing cards that allow you to add or pivot bumpers and add or move balls on the Bumparena board. If you draw a Release Now card, release all the balls immediately!

    "description": "An electronic music version of the trivia board game.  Two teams sit in such a way that they are in between two of their opponents and facing everyone.  The game is much like Hot Potato; a song and artist appears on the screen of the handheld device.  The player currently holding it must get one of their teammates to correctly guess the name of the song.  They must do this without saying any part of a word on the screen, rhyming any parts of those words, or saying the first letter of any of those words.  When a teammate guesses correctly, the device is passed to the left for the other team to do the same.  The round ends when an internal timer runs out and a buzzer sounds.  The team not holding the device at that time scores a point.&#10;&#10;There are two ways to play, and scoring is different in each.  The first is similar to classic Catch Phrase.  However, if you wish to incorporate singing into the game, the other version adds an extra point for any clue that is sung, if the team guesses correctly.&#10;&#10;The game has 9 categories to choose from each round: Pop Mix, 70s, 80s 90s, 2000s, Classic Rock, Hip Hop/R&amp;B, Country, Oldies.&#10;&#10;The game requires 3 AAA batteries, not included.&#10;&#10;",

Yes, no surprise there!&#10;&#10;Each player starts with a hand of cards, with each showing a two-digit number, although sometimes one digit is a ?, a &quot;wild&quot; stands for a digit of your choice. Place three cards face up in the pool and one card face up on the floor. A condition tile starts on the pivot side; more on that later.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you can play any number of cards from your hand as long as the first number on these cards matches the last number on the floor card. (That last number is the &quot;pivot&quot;.) Arrange your played cards on the floor in the order of your choice with the top card becoming the new floor.&#10;&#10;If you can chain three consecutive numbers, you can play them no matter what the floor card is, then you take another turn.&#10;&#10;Instead of playing or chaining, you can take a pool card or the top card of the deck into your hand, refilling the pool, if necessary.&#10;&#10;Finally, you can reset by taking all three pool cards into your hand, then flipping the condition tile. The side opposite &quot;pivot&quot; is relay, and when relay is the condition, you can play cards one by one, with the first digit of each played card matching the last digit of the new floor card. Maybe you can empty your hand all in one go this way?&#10;&#10;When one player empties their hand, everyone else can only play or chain from that point, exiting the game when they can't put down cards on their turn. Each wild card still in hand is worth 3 points, and each non-wild card is 1 point.&#10;&#10;Play three rounds in this manner, then whoever has the fewest points wins.&#10;&#10;",

(Animal tiles, included those printed on the game board, feature 1-3 camera symbols, and you take as many picture tokens as cameras.) End your turn by drawing a new tile, with evening tiles becoming available after the morning tiles run out.&#10;&#10;To publish an article, choose an available magazine, then turn in as many animal tokens as required, e.g. five capybara tokens for the first article in the purple magazine. You can replace a missing token with a pair of another animal tokens, and you can do this multiple times. (Editors sometimes prefer quantity over quality, after all.) The next article in the purple magazine will require seven tokens, then nine, then eleven. The first article in the grey magazine requires any seven animal tokens. Later magazines include bonuses for those who are late to publication.&#10;&#10;The first player to place an article in each of the six magazines wins. If the tile supply runs out before this happens, whoever has the most articles wins, with remaining animal tokens being a tiebreaker.&#10;&#10;",

The first player places one of their dogs down on the table. The player to their left must then match either the size, or the behaviour of that dog, and place theirs on top. If they can&rsquo;t, they have to pick up cards from the stock pile until they can place one down. And so it goes.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Particularly devious gamblers might even pay the fixer to change their bets during the battle.&#10;&#10;Occasionally your opponents will be helping a shared bet; occasionally they'll be knocking out mechs you need to survive. Since all bets are hidden, you won't know until the end and might even be able to bluff an opponent into accidentally doing exactly what you want.&#10;&#10;Five mech teams face off, each with three robots, and in each of three rounds, you bet on which team will have the most surviving mechs, which will KO the most mechs, which team will be eliminated first, and which five robots will be standing at round's end. The fewer the players who bet correctly, the bigger the payout for those who do. After three rounds, whoever has bet best wins.&#10;&#10;",

For the survival of mankind, you embark on a daring journey to a mysterious wormhole in the heart of the Andromeda. Through this portal to another place in the universe, you hope to escape from the impending doom.&#10;&#10;But you are not alone. From all corners of the galaxy, spaceships gather in front of the wormhole. But only 1 can pass through at a time. Your heart rate increases synchronously to the charging of the warp drive and ask yourselves &hellip;  &quot;Will we get away in time?&quot;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Tactical and ThrillingAndromeda Escape combines a minimum of rules with a maximum of tactics, excitement and fun. Be the first to bring your fleet to safety. Position yourselves and block your opponents. Influence the positions of space ships by playing cards and earn points by navigating your ships through the wormhole at the right moment or by achieving missions. The winner is the player with the most VP at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;GameplayThe game board consists of three interstellar spaceway routes connected to the center of the Andromeda veil. Here lies a mysterious wormhole, providing a portal to another dimension. Each player has a fleet of 6 to 10 Spaceships, depending on the number of players. Clockwise, every player takes a turn. During your turn, you either place a new ship on the outer rim of the game board, or you move a ship on the game board one node closer to the center.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Navigate your Spaceships trough the wormholeGrab an open Action Card when you move one of your spaceships into the wormhole. Action Cards let you influence the game greatly by repositioning spaceships and will grant or cost you VP. As the 2 Action Cards on the game board are only replenished when both of them are taken, it is crucial to enter the wormhole at the right moment to pick that one card that you need (or to push a spaceships of another player into the wormhole to give him that one card that no one wants).&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Need to skip a turn?At some point the interstellar gateway becomes somewhat crowded.

Charleston?&#10;&#10;No, it's the Adriatic, in a short and violent naval war between Italy and Austria-Hungary. Yes, you heard right. Finally, you'll have a chance to see the Austro-Hungarian navy in action. Historically, they did very well. How will you do?&#10;&#10;The &quot;Seven Weeks War&quot; of 1866 is also known as the Third Italian Independence War. The Italians want Venice. The Austrians have it. But the Italians are allied with up-and-coming Prussia, and the Austrians have a hard time on land. On the Adriatic, the Austrio-Hungarian fleet is outnumbered and out gunned, more to 2-1 in both categories. But they have aggressive commanders and a willingness to &quot;Ram anything painted grey!&quot; That was the signal from the Austrio-Hungarian flagship (the Italians would be the folks with gray ships). The same signal included the sentence, &quot;There must be a victory at Lissa.&quot;&#10;&#10;And now it's up to you to find out if there will be, or if the Italians succeed in making the Adriatic &quot;an Italian lake.&quot;&#10;&#10;It is a classic confrontation, by designer Paul Rohrbaugh, of numbers versus quality, with over 200 multi-sized counters featuring individual ships and the admirals who commanded the fleets. Players maneuver on an operational map and then shift to smaller battle maps when it's time to put their iron to the test.&#10;&#10;Two scenarios - just the conclusive Battle of Lissa or the entire campaign, along with important random events, intrusions by the French and Turks, optional rules for ships and events that could have happened, and more. Will you, as Italian Admiral Persano, see that the Austrian flag is &quot;swept&quot; from the Adriatic? Or will you, as Austrian Admiral Tegetthoff prove that your rams and unusual &quot;flying wedge&quot; formation can overcome superior firepower?&#10;&#10;The choices are yours!&#10;&#10;",

During play, they will reveal or replace Stroke cards in their tableau and possibly alter cards in their own or other players' tableau through the use of Action cards.&#10;&#10;Players each start with a 3x3 tableau of face down stroke cards and a hand of three action cards. Player turns are played in two phases: a Stroke phase and an Action phase. During the Stroke phase, players will reveal a face down card, or replace one of the cards in their tableau with one from the Stroke deck or Stroke discard pile. During the Action phase, players may play an action, such as Zombie Gophers, Sacrificial Caddy, or Night Vision Goggles, to affect play.&#10;&#10;After one of the players reveals his or her last face down Stroke card, the other players have one more turn. Then all cards are revealed and the strokes in each players tableau are totaled. The winner is the player with the lowest total score after two rounds.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Once all Producers have revealed their Vote cards the votes are tallied.

Tokens count as 1 Yes vote): If there are Yes votes greater than or equal to the number of No votes the movie is being produced! The Screenwriter gathers up all of the title cards in their movie and places them in order in a pile in front of them, making sure to keep it separate from their other movies. All Producers that revealed a Yes &#10;Vote card, now draw 1 Popcorn token and place it facedown in front of them. All Producers that revealed a Yes! Vote card, now draw 1 Popcorn token for each Title card in the Screenwriter&rsquo;s movie pitch.&#10;&#10;Regardless of the outcome of the vote, all players that voted Yes! remove their Vote card from the game.

Players can either accept a raise or fold and take the lower number of points.

That struggle historically pitted Rome against Carthage in a titanic clash that shaped the fate of the Western world for the next several centuries. The historical scenario therefore also pits two players against each other, one commanding Rome and the other Carthage.&#10;&#10;Third and fourth players can be added, however, to explore the possibilities had the 2nd Punic War grown even larger through greater Gallic and Macedonian participation. Each player has a variety of military and political instruments with which he can attempt to carve out an empire and annihilate his foes. The game uses an evolution of the system first presented in the earlier, and much liked, S&amp;T game &quot;1066.&quot;&#10;&#10;The square-grid map shows all the western and central Mediterranean from Iberia on the west to Greece in the east. Each square equals 100 Roman miles from side to side.&#10;&#10;Each of the iconic units within the large-size counter-mix (176 total), by famed artist Nicolas Eskubi, represents about 5,000 to 20,000 combatants. The unit-types represented include: legions, phalanxes, Gaesati (fanatic barbarian warriors), light infantry, cavalry, garrisons, war elephants, and fleets.&#10;&#10;Each of the 17 game turns equals one year, and experienced players can count on being able to finish a match in about four to six hours.&#10;&#10;",

Each scoring card is read as follows: &quot;If the largest contiguous mass of color A is larger than the largest contiguous mass of color B, then score points equal to the number of hexes in the largest contiguous mass of color C.&quot; Lots of contiguity in there!&#10;&#10;A player draws one or two new tiles at the end of her turn, and the game continues until either someone runs out of scoring cards or a player can't refill her visible display of tiles. In either case, each player again receives 3-5 scoring cards adding those to any remaining in hand then players start taking turns removing one or two tiles each turn, playing a scoring card if the player removes only one tile. The game ends once all the tiles have been removed from play, and the player with the highest score wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

If your pack gets too tired, you may have to go home empty-handed. Can you outwit the other coyotes and survive the heat?&#10;&#10;In this fast-paced bluffing game, each player is leading a pack of coyotes and attempting to deceive their opponents in order to enter their territory and acquire precious food for their pack. The players hold their coyotes in their hand, and either invade, defend, and/or rest coyotes each turn. As the coyotes fight, they become tired, and are eventually too exhausted to continue. One of the challenges of the game is trying to score as many points as possible, while at the same time managing the overall strength of your pack. You must skilfully deplete your deck to capture or defend coveted food and leverage your opponents&rsquo; current situation to your advantage. Only one desert pack can claim victory!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;&#10;Released in the March 2020 Board Game of the Month Club $20+ package.&#10;&#10;",

Opportunities are ripe in this community of traders, bankers, moneylenders, and dealers of grains and spices. Fortune awaits the one who plans well and uses his resources wisely. Oil, silk, incense and spices are the currency used to build tents, establish settlements, and amass riches &mdash; but commerce brings competition, and the space to build is limited. When there is no more room, the player who has maximized his resources to become the most successful merchant is the victor!&#10;&#10;In Bania, players use resource cards to buy and build tents, then strategically place these tents on the board to earn points. When no legal moves remain on the board, the game ends and the player with the most points wins. On a turn, a player performs these actions in order, if possible:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Collect your bonus: If your elephant marker sits on a tent tile on the board, collect one resource card of each type in the settlement where the marker is located.&#10;    Buy and place tent tiles OR roll for resources: As explained below.&#10;    Place your elephant marker: If your elephant marker isn't on the board and you placed tent tiles that turn, place the marker on one tile you placed this turn.&#10;&#10;&#10;Each player starts the game with four tent tiles and eight resource cards: two of each type (oil, spice, silk and incense); one side of the tent tiles shows one of these four resources, while the other side shows three resource symbols (e.g., two spice and one silk). If you want more resources, you can roll the four dice up to three times, locking any dice that you wish while doing so. When you stop rolling, you receive one resource card for each resource symbol showing; in addition, if you have both a front and back half of an elephant showing on the dice, then you receive an elephant marker bonus as at the start of your turn.&#10;&#10;If you have the right cards in hand, you might instead choose to buy and place tents; if you have twelve or more cards, then you must do so. A tent costs three resource cards matching the three resource symbols on the back and you pay this cost after placing a tent on the game board, but if you place a tent adjacent to other tents, then the cost is discounted based on the colors of adjacent tents, possibly allowing you to place a tent for no cost at all! When you place a tent on its own to start a settlement, you receive 3 points; for all other tents placed, you receive 1 point each. You refill your hand to four tent tiles at the end of your turn &mdash; but if you've placed all four, you can immediately draw four new tiles and keep building!&#10;&#10;A settlement can have at most seven tents in it; when someone places the seventh tent, any elephant markers in the settlement are removed and returned to their owners. The game ends when no more tents can be placed. Whoever placed the final tile scores 3 points, and whoever has the most of each type of resource card scores 2 points. The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

You'll call upon your favorite Ghostbusters to help you set your ghost trap and capture the highest point ghosts on the board.&#10;&#10;The game is played over three rounds. In each round, players take turns, beginning with the start player and continuing in clockwise order, until all twelve cards from the circle have been captured. On your turn, carry out these three steps:&#10;&#10;1. Take up to two actions, either playing or discarding an action card for each action as you choose. When you play an action card, you carry out its effect, then discard it; when you discard an action card, place it on the discard pile, then draw a new action card.&#10;&#10;If any ghosts you've already captured have action abilities, you may use those during this step, in addition to your two actions. Each ghost's ability can be used only once per round.&#10;&#10;2. Capture the ghost card that the ghost trap is in front of, but only if you played at least one action card this turn. Take that ghost card and place it in your player area with any other ghosts you've already captured, then move the ghost trap to the next ghost card in the circle &mdash; either clockwise or counterclockwise depending on the current direction of play.&#10;&#10;3. Refill your hand to three action cards.&#10;&#10;The round ends when the last ghost card remaining in the circle has been captured. To prepare for the next round, deal twelve more cards from the top of the ghost deck to form a new circle, and reset the ghost trap to the top of the circle.

Each monster has a lane indicator that tells the player which lane the monster will enter. The field itself is 5 rows by 4 lanes. If ever 2 monsters enter the same lane, the second one pushes the first one farther toward the player.&#10;&#10;In the player phase, the active player uses defenses and tricks to protect themselves or damage other player's fields. The active player always starts their player phase with 5 cards in their hand.&#10;&#10;In the movement phase, each monster moves down the field one tile. If they run into a defense, combat happens and either the monster or defense with the higher power wins combat.&#10;&#10;In the cleanup phase, players finish any effects that need to resolve, remove any defenses or monsters that have been destroyed in combat, and refill their hand up to 5 cards total.&#10;&#10;The player who is the last person standing is the winner!&#10;&#10;",

To do this, at the start of your turn you roll two dice, then move forward a distance equal to either of the dice or the sum of them. If you want the tile on which you land, you can place it in your wheelbarrow. The trick, however, is that you need to remember all of the tiles that you've already acquired because once you reach the end of the road you try to fill in your blueprint from bottom to top with those tiles; for each wrongly collected tile, you must discard one that's perfect for your plan. Whoever first manages to use the colored tiles to build their predetermined anthill wins.&#10;&#10;The Ants Go Marching includes anthills of different levels to allow players of different skill levels to compete more evenly.&#10;&#10;",

And will you be willing to put your points where your memory is? Shuffle the cards, then place them face down in a grid formation. The first player reveals two cards. Do the containers match in type, color, size, or pattern? If yes, that's a pair! Now comes a test of your mettle: Will you take your points and run, or will you gamble them by flipping another card and hoping it shares a feature with the first two?

The Sultan's absolute reign has lasted 33 years and he has no intent to surrender his power. He controls his entire Empire using the spy network he created. He suspect the Young Turks would dethrone him. thus, the Sultan rules the Empire and paranoia rules the Sultan.&#10;&#10;In &#196;&#176;ttihat, there are 3 factions: The Unionists, the Sultan Abdulhamid II and his Spies, and (with at least seven players) and the Separatists. In the game, the roles of unionists and spies are hidden, while the player who plays the Sultan has his card face up. Other players build their strategies without seeing each others' roles. Players bid for control of key provinces, some of which grant military strength. The Unionist players win if their side controls four of the of the provinces in play at the end of the game or when they stage a successful coup. The Separatist player wins if no other faction controls four provinces at the end of the game. Otherwise, the faction of the Sultan and of the Spies wins.&#10;&#10;",

Each player is a lord who tries to populate their estate with citizens, fight diseases and succeed in the crusades.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is simple as it is: gain more winning points and there are only two ways to do it - collect as many worthy citizens and win as many crusades as possible.&#10;&#10;The mechanics of the game is quite similar to Ticket to Ride: three cards lay open in the &quot;market&quot; and other are stacked in the deck. Each player at their turn draws one card from the deck and one card from the market. After that the player has to play those cards instantly in any order in any city.&#10;&#10;Some cards may have negative winning points worth or carry negative immediate effects - this is the reason to put those cards in opponents' towns.&#10;&#10;Apart from three types of citizen cards: knights, priests and commoners players may draw a disease card and play it to start an epidemic. Epidemic goes from one city to another killing inhabitants with weakest immune system. At the same time, some diseases like leprosy prefer to start with priests, others with commoners or knights.&#10;&#10;In addition to easy and pleasant mechanics and fun &quot;Take that!&quot; effect the games offer hilarious and well-designed cards based on &quot;Medieval suffering&quot; memes - excerpts from medieval paintings with comic quotes&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;&#208;&#150;&#208;&#184;&#208;&#183;&#208;&#189;&#209;&#140; &#209;&#129;&#209;&#128;&#208;&#181;&#208;&#180;&#208;&#189;&#208;&#181;&#208;&#178;&#208;&#181;&#208;&#186;&#208;&#190;&#208;&#178;&#209;&#139;&#209;&#133; &#208;&#187;&#209;&#142;&#208;&#180;&#208;&#181;&#208;&#185; &#209;&#130;&#209;&#143;&#208;&#182;&#208;&#181;&#208;&#187;&#208;&#176; &#208;&#184; &#208;&#191;&#208;&#190;&#208;&#187;&#208;&#189;&#208;&#176; &#209;&#129;&#209;&#130;&#209;&#128;&#208;&#176;&#208;&#180;&#208;&#176;&#208;&#189;&#208;&#184;&#208;&#185;. &#208;&#146;&#208;&#190;&#208;&#184;&#208;&#189;&#209;&#139; &#209;&#131;&#209;&#133;&#208;&#190;&#208;&#180;&#209;&#143;&#209;&#130; &#208;&#178; &#208;&#154;&#209;&#128;&#208;&#181;&#209;&#129;&#209;&#130;&#208;&#190;&#208;&#178;&#209;&#139;&#208;&#181; &#208;&#159;&#208;&#190;&#209;&#133;&#208;&#190;&#208;&#180;&#209;&#139;, &#209;&#128;&#208;&#176;&#208;&#183;&#208;&#187;&#208;&#184;&#209;&#135;&#208;&#189;&#209;&#139;&#208;&#181; &#208;&#173;&#208;&#191;&#208;&#184;&#208;&#180;&#208;&#181;&#208;&#188;&#208;&#184;&#208;&#184; &#208;&#177;&#209;&#131;&#208;&#186;&#208;&#178;&#208;&#176;&#208;&#187;&#209;&#140;&#208;&#189;&#208;&#190; &#208;&#178;&#209;&#139;&#208;&#186;&#208;&#176;&#209;&#136;&#208;&#184;&#208;&#178;&#208;&#176;&#209;&#142;&#209;&#130; &#208;&#189;&#208;&#176; &#208;&#186;&#208;&#190;&#209;&#128;&#208;&#189;&#209;&#142; &#209;&#134;&#208;&#181;&#208;&#187;&#209;&#139;&#208;&#181; &#208;&#191;&#208;&#190;&#209;&#129;&#208;&#181;&#208;&#187;&#208;&#181;&#208;&#189;&#208;&#184;&#209;&#143;, &#208;&#176; &#209;&#130;&#208;&#181;&#209;&#133; &#208;&#189;&#208;&#181;&#208;&#188;&#208;&#189;&#208;&#190;&#208;&#179;&#208;&#184;&#209;&#133;, &#208;&#186;&#208;&#190;&#208;&#188;&#209;&#131; &#208;&#191;&#208;&#190;&#209;&#129;&#209;&#135;&#208;&#176;&#209;&#129;&#209;&#130;&#208;&#187;&#208;&#184;&#208;&#178;&#208;&#184;&#208;&#187;&#208;&#190;&#209;&#129;&#209;&#140; &#208;&#190;&#209;&#129;&#209;&#130;&#208;&#176;&#209;&#130;&#209;&#140;&#209;&#129;&#209;&#143; &#208;&#178; &#208;&#182;&#208;&#184;&#208;&#178;&#209;&#139;&#209;&#133;, &#209;&#129; &#209;&#128;&#208;&#176;&#208;&#180;&#208;&#190;&#209;&#129;&#209;&#130;&#209;&#140;&#209;&#142; &#209;&#129;&#208;&#182;&#208;&#184;&#208;&#179;&#208;&#176;&#208;&#181;&#209;&#130; &#208;&#184;&#208;&#189;&#208;&#186;&#208;&#178;&#208;&#184;&#208;&#183;&#208;&#184;&#209;&#134;&#208;&#184;&#209;&#143;. &#208;&#146; &#209;&#141;&#209;&#130;&#208;&#190; &#208;&#189;&#208;&#181;&#208;&#191;&#209;&#128;&#208;&#190;&#209;&#129;&#209;&#130;&#208;&#190;&#208;&#181; &#208;&#178;&#209;&#128;&#208;&#181;&#208;&#188;&#209;&#143; &#208;&#178;&#208;&#176;&#208;&#188; &#208;&#191;&#209;&#128;&#208;&#184;&#208;&#180;&#209;&#145;&#209;&#130;&#209;&#129;&#209;&#143; &#208;&#178;&#208;&#190;&#208;&#183;&#208;&#179;&#208;&#187;&#208;&#176;&#208;&#178;&#208;&#184;&#209;&#130;&#209;&#140; &#208;&#190;&#208;&#180;&#208;&#184;&#208;&#189; &#208;&#184;&#208;&#183; &#208;&#179;&#208;&#190;&#209;&#128;&#208;&#190;&#208;&#180;&#208;&#190;&#208;&#178; &#208;&#184; &#208;&#191;&#209;&#128;&#208;&#184;&#208;&#187;&#208;&#190;&#208;&#182;&#208;&#184;&#209;&#130;&#209;&#140; &#208;&#178;&#209;&#129;&#208;&#181; &#208;&#178;&#208;&#190;&#208;&#183;&#208;&#188;&#208;&#190;&#208;&#182;&#208;&#189;&#209;&#139;&#208;&#181; &#209;&#131;&#209;&#129;&#208;&#184;&#208;&#187;&#208;&#184;&#209;&#143;, &#209;&#135;&#209;&#130;&#208;&#190;&#208;&#177;&#209;&#139; &#208;&#178; &#209;&#141;&#209;&#130;&#208;&#190;&#208;&#188; &#208;&#183;&#208;&#176;&#208;&#177;&#209;&#139;&#209;&#130;&#208;&#190;&#208;&#188; &#208;&#177;&#208;&#190;&#208;&#179;&#208;&#190;&#208;&#188; &#208;&#188;&#208;&#181;&#209;&#129;&#209;&#130;&#208;&#181; &#209;&#133;&#208;&#190;&#209;&#130;&#209;&#140; &#208;&#186;&#209;&#130;&#208;&#190;-&#208;&#189;&#208;&#184;&#208;&#177;&#209;&#131;&#208;&#180;&#209;&#140; &#208;&#178;&#209;&#139;&#208;&#182;&#208;&#184;&#208;&#187;.&#10;&#10;&#208;&#160;&#208;&#181;&#209;&#136;&#208;&#176;&#208;&#185;&#209;&#130;&#208;&#181;, &#208;&#186;&#208;&#190;&#208;&#179;&#208;&#190; &#208;&#191;&#208;&#190;&#209;&#129;&#208;&#181;&#208;&#187;&#208;&#184;&#209;&#130;&#209;&#140; &#208;&#178; &#208;&#178;&#208;&#176;&#209;&#136;&#208;&#181;&#208;&#188; &#208;&#179;&#208;&#190;&#209;&#128;&#208;&#190;&#208;&#180;&#208;&#181;: &#208;&#149;&#208;&#191;&#208;&#184;&#209;&#129;&#208;&#186;&#208;&#190;&#208;&#191;&#208;&#176; &#208;&#184;&#208;&#187;&#208;&#184; &#208;&#154;&#208;&#190;&#208;&#189;&#209;&#143;?

For this first set, the creatures, or Beasties as we call them, are USA based cryptids (i.e. Bigfoot, Mothman, Jersey Devil, etc...).&#10;&#10;What sets MetaZoo: Cryptid Nation apart is its core mechanic of breaking the 4th wall, or &quot;meta&quot;. From a gameplay perspective, this means that the strength of your Beasties and Spells are impacted by the environment you play in. Playing on a rainy day? Your water Beasties and Spells get a power boost. Playing near an open fire while trying to keep warm as it snows outside? Your Flame spells are now twice as powerful, but watch out... the Snow outside not only boosts the strength of your opponent's Snow Beasties, but also makes some of them invisible (unable to be directly attacked).&#10;&#10;This added level of meta means choosing your battleground to best suit your deck build, or rapidly building decks to suit your environment, is a key feature of the game. Imagine playing a friend, but deftly convincing them to play next to a patch of trees to gain additional power boosts for your Forest Beasties!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

It covers aspects from Equality to Organic Food, from War in Iraq to Torture Scandal, to Youth Culture, Women's Priesthood and beyond. Those are but few aspects the players wrestle with as they try to convince the deep rows of the people behind their own agenda.&#10;&#10;The players all live in the same society and seek influential power to leave their mark on the surrounding world. The people's opinions, what they feel and think, is determined by four societal values &ndash; militarism, economy, human values &amp; green values.&#10;&#10;The players have game cards which become &rdquo;hot topics&rdquo; in the society once they are played. They will become the issues the imaginary townsfolk talk in coffee tables, what they read from the news and what shapes their view on the world. These issues then shape the four values, but also bring points through them. This means that the more militaristic the society is the more militaristic influence points you get from cards like 'Raise in Defence Budget' or 'War on Terrorism'. With these points you then push through laws that focus on that value. Only these law cards that the players have pushed through with their political influence they get victory points. And as each value has limited amount of laws there is a race who stands as the best advocate for each value.&#10;&#10;Most cards have special abilities that makes them stronger with certain other cards (i.e. Feminism with Equality) or for example prevent certain points to be scored (i.e. Torture Scandal on militarism points or UN in Crisis on Human value points).&#10;&#10;As the game proceeds the players try to sell their world view to the masses. But whether the well-being of the people is trampled as the players thirst for power and whether that society is still worth defending for? That is what the players decide all over again during each game they play the Modern Society.&#10;&#10;",

The first egg in a nest scores fewer points than the third. Also, there are females who are better suited for mating (they have matching color) and their eggs thus earn a bonus.&#10;The King of the Nest will, without a doubt, be the one who manages to mate with all the females, i.e. to collect eggs in all the colors.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

If you make the right bet early, you'll get many victory points in the end. Bet later, and you can better estimate the finish and get points more safely. But the die plays a role as well: Should I advance my favorite with the &quot;3&quot; I've rolled, or should I try to roll a higher number? If my luck with the die doesn't meet my calculations, the malicious joy of the other players is guaranteed.&#10;&#10;When the first three donkeys have crossed the finish line, the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

If you guess correctly, both you and the player acting out the clue score.  Guess as many cards as you can within the time limit.
