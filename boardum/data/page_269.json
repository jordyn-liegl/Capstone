First you build the game itself from the provided Lego components, then 2-4 people can play the code game.  Once the game is assembled, players set up their own secret code by placing 4 of the colored jewels inside their treasure chest. Players then take turns rolling the die, selecting colored jewels to 'guess' the codes of the other players. Similar to Mastermind, jewel placement is confirmed as correct/right place, correct/wrong place, or not correct at all. Play continues until all the codes have been cracked; last person standing is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

The new neon-green-and-purple JX has blocks with slanted sides, allowing the players to construct towers that lean precariously to one side without toppling due to the weight distribution that the new blocks allow.&#10;&#10;The game can be played as a competitive exercise where each player tries placing his block in a position so that the next player's block will make the tower fall over.

Each color set contains two cards of each number: 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Blue and yellow also have one card numbered 6.&#10;&#10;Each player is dealt 5 cards and the rest of the cards are not used in the game. The cards represent balls being thrown from player to player, with the card's number showing its speed. The dealer places one face-up card in front of another player. That player then places one of their cards in front of another player. They may choose a higher-numbered card or a card of the same color from their hand. Alternatively, they may pick up all the cards in front of them, add them to their hand, then choose to play any of the cards in their hand. The winner is the first player to play the last card from their hand to a player who is unable to play.&#10;&#10;",

Each dial has one of six symbols showing. To access the treasure cards beneath the lid the players alternate turns to twist the dials to show the combination of symbols which match the genie card that is in play. When the genie card has been matched, the player may take as many treasure cards as desired. If a player finds a snake card among the treasure cards taken then the player forfeits all treasure cards taken that turn. Whenever a player is done taking treasure cards a new genie card is put in play and the game continues.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the final genie card is out of play or the final snake has been found. The player with the highest total in treasure cards is the winner. The game is in German, French, and Spanish.&#10;&#10;This game is also published in an English version from Ravensburger as &quot;Open Sesame&quot;.&#10;&#10;",

In addition, 80 victory point chips are included.&#10;&#10;Each round is played as follows: the dealer will deal each player three cards. Four cards are played on the table, open. The players now take turns playing cards. On each turn, a player can play exactly one card. A player can use this card to capture a number of cards on the table. Cards can be captured if the sum of those cards is equal to the card played (i.e. you can capture a six and a two by playing an eight). If a player cannot capture any cards, he has to add a card to those open on the table. A player gets one point for capturing all cards on the table.&#10;&#10;The round lasts until all players have played their three hand cards. Now, each player receives points: One point for the player who has captured the yellow seven, one point for the player who has captured the most yellow cards and one point for the player who has captured the most cards.&#10;&#10;The play continues for a couple of rounds (either six rounds for two or three players, or a number of rounds equal to the number of players if there are four or more players. In the end, the player who has collected the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "First edition:&#10;&#10;Rather silly party game, distributed by a certain coffee retail powerhouse that will remain nameless.&#10;&#10;As one moves around the board, one can land on _Brainstorm_ (vaguely reminiscent of free-association Scattergories), _Survey Says!_ (a touch like the Family Feud TV game show), or present a short _Sound Bite_ to the other players, who will vote on presentation and persuasiveness.&#10;&#10;To make sure no-one takes the proceedings too seriously, there's a _Skid Row_ space (lose all points, and beg the other players to donate.  Why would they want to, you ask?) and a _Party Change_ spot - where you change identities (color, score, seat, beverage?!?) with another player.&#10;&#10;Like all such games, it works well with the right crowd.&#10;&#10;Second edition:&#10;&#10;Hear Me Out, in its latest form, corrects some of the major problems the first edition had. Players take turns rolling a die which will determine what kind of challenge they will take. One such challenge involves matching another player's answer to a fill-in-the-blank question (such as &quot;Nuclear BLANK&quot;). Another challenge has you ranting about a bizarre topic for 30 seconds. This challenge is unique in that rather than earning points right away, players write your color down and give you a score (1-3) on how well you did, and put it into a ballot box. Later in the game if you are unfortunate enough to have to switch colors with someone they all of a sudden will be in control of the points you have in the ballot box. The game continues until one person reaches the finish space, at which point the remaining players have one turn to get as far as possible. Some bonus points are added in to determine the true winner.&#10;&#10;What makes this game interesting is that the points you earn are never really yours. In a certain type of challenge, if a challenger wins he can trade colored pawns with the loser of the challenge, which not only affects his position on the board, but can earn him bonus points if that person got lots of votes in his speaking rounds.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Something Different is a card game that started out with a simple idea: A game in which the rules change as you play. What it evolved into is a fantastic party game in which players get to know each other and engage in hilarious challenges.&#10;&#10;The game consists of a deck of 100 cards. Each player starts with a hand of seven cards and is attempting to empty his hand to win. Next to the main deck, three cards are turned face up, each with a different rule. Each turn you play a card on one of these piles from your hand, changing the current rules in play. If you break a rule at any time, you draw a card. Sounds simple enough, but it gets better. The basic rules tell you which color cards you can play or what suit they need to be, but other cards may restrict what you can do physically, such as making you keep one hand on the table or making you talk like a pirate.&#10;&#10;The other notable mechanism in the game includes personal trivia, duels, and mini events called &quot;switch-a-roos&quot;. When trivia rules are in play, you get to test another player's knowledge of you. If they answer a question wrong, they draw a card &mdash; but at least they learned something about you! Duels are just as they sound &mdash; thumb wars, staring contests and more &mdash; but while you duel someone, play continues. The winner of a duel brags, the loser draws more cards. Switch-a-roos change the playing field, causing people to swap hands, trade seats, or reverse the order of play.&#10;&#10;",

In addition to the number dice, another die is rolled that allows you to block other players or even switch decks with them.&#10;&#10;You win if you're the first to remove all your cards.&#10;&#10;",

With the Washington Naval Conference and its resulting treaty limitations on ship numbers and tonnages, the battleship went completely over to 2nd generation designs, including all the major conversions, and then the final burst of 3rd generation dreadnoughts.    Meantime, also as a result of the treaty, a now type of warship, the heavy cruiser, came to the fore and began a progress still unfinished in the modern missile cruiser. These events through 1945 are covered by BATTLESHIP.  The game system was designed to reflect the concept of the Immune Zone, around which capital ship design revolved. This zone is roughly represented by the medium range defense value. But since when this value will come into effect is a result of the characteristics of the opposing player's guns, you must conduct your movements to, whenever possible, be in your immune zone while your opponent is being fired on at either long or short range. It is within these margins that damage can be done in safety.  A hint: learn to use escorts. Properly handled they can shape an engagement early by threat of torpedo action.&quot;&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Simulations Canada's Battleship&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Players move around the board in monopoly manner and can land on a variety of fields: Information (card drawing - a bit risk-cards type), Memo (card drawing - bonus-card-like), Drilling or Helicopter (allow to buy drilling rights), Stock Market (allows to buy stocks).&#10;&#10;Each time a player passes one of the 2 production fields, his oil fields produce certain quantities of oil (Kuwait producing most, Iraq second most, Qatar, Iran and Trinidad only little). When opting for drilling, the player token is moved from the board on a special drilling track which can either end with finding a well or with failure. At any time, a player can ship a cargo  of his oil to the world's major ports (the ships move on the world map which is at the center of the board), the profit depends on the current price for oil (1-4, depending on what the Information cards bring).&#10;&#10;Players agree on a certain time limit and the richest player at that time wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "From the box:&#10;In the beginning those that could master going between dimensions thought of it as novelty. There were worlds to discover, creatures to see and most importantly magic to master. But with all these things to keep them busy there was one thing they did not forget, Power. Soon it was easier to take from others than to find it on your own. The only place to hide was in great magical towers that they built between dimensions. All times in your world and in the others are at your disposal.&#10;&#10;Will you be the last to Reign in Towers in Time?&#10;&#10;Play overview:&#10;Each player represents a spellcaster, dueling with the other players for control of an abstractly defined extradimensional space.  Each player has five shields, represented by cards from that player's deck, that serve to anchor the player the dimension within the game's story, and as the player's presence in the game mechanically.  The goal is to eliminate the shields of all other players; when a player has no shields remaining, they are banished from the pocket dimension, and out of the game.  Victory goes to the last player with shields in play.&#10;&#10;To combat one another, players play Source cards, representing connections to various natural locations, be they landforms, weather phenomena, or natural disasters.  These resource cards allow the player to access Temper, the main resource in Towers in Time, themed to the four elements.  Using Temper, players pay the costs to summon creatures to wage war, conjure magical objects and artifacts to enhance the effectiveness of recruited creatures, and cast spells to strengthen their minions and weaken the opposing armies.  Additionally, once creatures are in play, most of them can provide Temper as well, although typically less than Source cards; most cards in Towers in Time are resource generators in addition to their other game effects.&#10;&#10;Source cards serve as the base for the titular Towers of Towers in Time.  Each Source has a default file of three ranks atop it, each space of which can be occupied by creatures and the cards they carry.  Creatures enter play within Towers, and must match the element represented by the Source atop which it stands (except for Neutral creatures, which may be played into any Tower).  There are rules to determine which creatures can enter play in which locations within a Tower, but once in play, most creatures can move between Towers, taking attached cards with them when they move.&#10;&#10;Turns do not follow the turn format common to many contemporary CCGs.  Instead, several phases are completed simultaneously by all players, then players alternate initiating and resolving a single action until both players have passed.  Action resolution varies depending on their effect, with some actions initiating a separate resolution phase with its own actions and timing (such as combat) and others are single-step actions (such as playing a card).  Additionally, a number of supplemental actions (&quot;free&quot; actions) facilitate utility functions, such as drawing Temper to pay for spells.  The opportunity to act first during the action round is determined by the player who won initiative during game setup (for the first turn only), or the player who did not take the last pass action on the previous turn.&#10;&#10;",

Like Bingo, one may win by matching all of the fields on the grid-card, or by matching a horizontal, vertical or diagonal line. The cards themselves are colourfully and engagingly illustrated, and the Spanish captions will be helpful to anyone studying that language. Because the Loter&iacute;a cards include the name of the item beneath its illustration, they are used to teach reading, writing, history and social values. Many bilingual teachers use the game as a teaching tool in the United States.&#10;&#10;The most recognized version of Loter&iacute;a is the &quot;Don Clemente Gallo&quot; version, introduced in Mexico in 1887 by French businessman Don Clemente Jacques. The owners of Don Clemente Gallo Pasatiempos have continued this version through three generations. Throughout the past hundred years, the original artwork found on its 54 cards has remained the same, though the company issued a special edition in 2002 featuring the paintings of artist Teresa Villegas.&#10;&#10;",

Ships are designed and built in secret, with weapons and upgrades remaining secret until each is used for the first time. The variety of mounts, ships, weapons, and upgrades gives players thousands of possible builds. Opponents duel in a deep space arena that may include asteroids, moons, and planets.

A typical card will have three boxes at the bottom and in each box there will be a number. For example, the first box might say 8, the second box 7 and the third box +12. The first box is how many spaces you go up the track on the board. The second box is how many you go back, so, in my example, you go forward 8 and back 7 (a gain of 1 forward). The third box is the risk number. If you decide to take a risk, you roll the three dice and if you roll or beat the number (12 in my example) in the third box, you avoid the minus amount in box 2. But if you don't roll enough, then the minus points are doubled.&#10;&#10;At certain points when you cross spaces marked in red on the board, you draw the top card from the Teacher's deck and apply the numbers by adding them to the card played. This will normally result in higher moves, higher minuses and the dice roll needed if you decide to take a risk to avoid the minus number.&#10;&#10;The one with the most advanced spot on the board when the 60 Pupil cards have been used up, wins.&#10;&#10;Despite the common name and similar-appearing artwork, this is not the same game as Silence in Class!&#10;&#10;",

When you activate an action card, you can remove birds from the card &mdash; possibly paying worms, nests and eggs as well &mdash; to take the action shown, such as removing two birds from &quot;Feeding&quot; to get three worms. Spent birds are returned to your personal pool of resources, while other spent resources are placed on the side.

    "description": "&quot;Sch&auml;tze des Dunklen Turmes&quot; is a roll and move fantasy adventure game.&#10;&#10;Each player rolls dice and moves his character through the maze-like corridors of the dark tower. After the movement, the player has either reached a special field of the board or gets to draw a random encounter card. This may be an item to pick up or an enemy that must be overcome. At the special fields, keys may be collected or allied spirits recruited.&#10;&#10;Combat is resolved with a special die, which is rolled alternately by the player and by the enemy. Depending on the roll of this die, the rolling party may regain health, inflict damage or invoke special powers. These powers allow to deal more damage, regain health, collect treasure after victory etc. Each player and each enemy has three such powers, and the die roll determines which is used.&#10;&#10;During the game, players collect rewards like gems and tokens that increase their fighting power. They may also increase their power by recruiting an allied spirit.&#10;&#10;The objective of the game is to collect four keys and open the treasure vault. To collect a key, a coin must be tossed when a key field of the board is reached. The coin is made of cardboard and shows either YES or NO. If the NO side comes up, the action fails and no key is found. The same mechanic is used to check if the treasure vault can be opened once it is reached with four keys - if this fails, four new keys must be collected to retry.&#10;&#10;To hinder the success of the other players, mines can be used. These represent small traps of different type. If a player walks across such a mine - represented by a small cardboard chit - the mine may e.g. destroy equipment.&#10;&#10;Rules are in English, German and Russian.&#10;&#10;",

The aim is to avoid taking the last trick.&#10;&#10;Each trick is led by the winner of the previous trick (the first trick is led by the player to the dealer's left). Each in turn must then play a card equal to or higher in rank than the previous card played. If they cannot, they then must play their lowest card. Whoever plays the highest card, or the last played if equally high, wins the trick.&#10;&#10;Whoever wins the last trick scores penalty points equal to the face value of the card they won the trick with (as does anyone who played a card of the same rank), counting Ace 14, King 13, Queen 12, and Jack 11.&#10;&#10;A player reaching 30 points is a &quot;cucumber&quot; and drops out of the game.&#10;&#10;",

It's up to the players to make them happy again by providing the nicest hay, the sunniest weather and the prettiest stable.

Off course, at the same time, you should prevent the other players from doing exactly so.&#10;&#10;Each player receives three cow cards (double sided, different moods) and one stable. The remaining cow cards (double sided,  are mixed together with the action cards. Three of them are spread out.

If it is a cow card you put in in front of you (without changing it's mood).
