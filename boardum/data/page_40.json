By using certain cards to peek at your own or opponent's cards, or swap cards with your opponent, you can try to minimize the value of your cards. When you think you have the lowest value, you can call end the round. If your value is not the lowest you receive a penalty. Rounds repeat until someone has scored 100 points, at which point the player with the fewest points wins.&#10;&#10;A game in the Golf family, it combines elements from Rat-a-Tat Cat and Cabo.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "On a map showing the western portion of the United States, each player takes turns building track to extend any of five major railroad lines westward from their originating cities.  Players often want the lines to extend in different directions toward the cities that they have a stake in. Some branching is allowed, but each line has a limited number of track pieces.&#10; Stakes for specific cities are accumulated throughout the game by drawing blind from a deck of city cards.  The more different lines arriving at a city, the higher the score will be for that city.  Later in the game, four short lines also become available.&#10;&#10;An updated version of Alan R. Moon's White Wind game Santa Fe.&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Summary&#10;The deck is composed of city cards (with some short lines shuffled into the middle third). Players have a hand of 4 city cards to start the game. Each round, players simultaneously select a card to play, then reveal. City cards are added to your personal display -- essentially, you have a share in that city. There are also several special cards (2x, 3x, 4-in-one, Branch Line, Boomtown) that modify the basic game turn. These specials are on public display, and can be acquired at the end of each round (some cost $1; the 2x may be held, but the rest must be played immediately after acquiring them).&#10;&#10;Then, in turn order, going twice around, players add a single track to any of the railheads (each of the 5 lines has specific starting locations on the board). If the link is to a previously unconnected city, collect $2. In addition, if the city is one of the goal cities of that train line, collect $4.&#10;&#10;After all players have gone (twice), pass the start player marker to the left. THEN, in turn order, players bring their hand total back to 4 (draw from deck and/or from cards on display). If a Short Line card is revealed, discard the card and draw again; that Short Line is now in play. They choose a card to play, and repeat above.&#10;&#10;The game ends when tracks for 3 lines are completely used. Each city's value is equal to its base value, printed on board, multiplied by the number of different train lines connected to it. The player with the most cash and city value wins!&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Malifaux is a character-driven 32mm tabletop miniatures game. Players collect, build, and paint models representing the denizens of Malifaux, pitting these models against one another in groups called Crews for control of the precious resource known as Soulstones.&#10;&#10;A Crew can contain several different types of models depending on how a player constructs it. Masters can manipulate the course of events in the world around them, changing their own Fates through their control or theft of Soulstones. A variety of fantastic and frightening beings, collectively known as Minions, serve the Master as fodder in his or her machinations. In addition, Henchmen can lead specialized Crews in their Master's absence, or serve their Master directly as a member of a Crew. Masters and Henchmen are also supported by Totems, extensions of their magical abilities which increase their spellcasting range and provide additional aid in an Encounter. Lastly, each Master can transform itself into a powerful Avatar, representing a specific aspect of their personality.&#10;&#10;How well a Crew carries out its leader's Strategy and Schemes determines whether or not it will emerge victorious in an Encounter with an enemy Crew. Strategies represent the Crew's main path to victory, while Schemes are simpler alternate routes to achieve the leader's goals.&#10;&#10;Malifaux players use decks of cards called Fate Decks to resolve game events such as attacking and spell-casting. Players can manipulate the cards they play to alter the Duel's outcome. It takes a shrewd leader to effectively utilize a Crew's resources, ensuring he or she always has ready the cards needed to Cheat Fate.&#10;&#10;",

Being granted the status of a municipium brought a town into the Roman orbit and involved both duties to Rome and a gradual extension of the Roman citizenship to the inhabitants.&#10;&#10;This game takes place in one of these municipalities in a western province.  The time is the middle of the 2nd Century AD, when the Empire had reached its greatest territorial extent and was enjoying its longest period of imperial peace.&#10;&#10;Players are each in control of a powerful family and try to strategically place their family members in the various institutions throughout the municipium and gain the support of the citizens: Scholars, Merchants, Soldiers, and Priests.  At various times during the game, if a player has the most influence in an institution, the player can exert the power of that institution and gain the support of certain citizens.  Meanwhile, the praefect moves around the municipium and players strive to have the most influence in the institutions that he visits, thereby earning his favour.  Each of these institutions have unique powers, and players must decide how and when to use them.

    "description": "BATTALIA: The Creation is a competitive, fast-paced, strategic deck-builder that combines map construction, hero and area control and unique calendar mechanisms.&#10;&#10;In the base game, all players will buy useful artefacts and hire battle and labor units to support their armies. They will build roads and cities and send their heroes to battle - every opponent will have to find the most powerful mixture of all these assets and apply them at the right moment, so eventually the player could claim to be the rightful ruler of Battalia and win the game. A victory can be obtained through aggressive conquest or a peaceful development of your own city system (if a player is lucky enough and the others let him ... :). Battalia has 2 game end conditions - full conclusion of the game board or first player, who achieves 5 cities of level four, immediately ends the game. The winner is the player with the most victory points at the and of the game and this is not necessary the same person, who made the final cut!&#10;&#10;An immersive game play will provide the opportunity for the players to make key decisions and turn the tides of even the grimmest of outcomes. A player can outmaneuver and BE outmaneuvered by his opponents at any point in the game.&#10;Dynamic atmosphere and intense battles are key factors in the overall experience, however the game strives to stimulate analytic thinking and strategy over rash and impulsive decisions.&#10;In general this is not a luck based game, because of the core deck building mechanics, but a die is integrated as an optional element and is the ingredient, which spices up the game for all the fortunate fellows! You will find also an element of bluffing, when you fight your battles, so put the poker face on and be ready to outsmart your opponent.&#10;The game is defined by the unique combination of mechanics, aesthetic art style, and the presence of large scale 3D Hero figures in four colors, representing the leaders of the players army and their movement on the board.&#10;&#10;The calendar mechanics is implemented in the Sun Oracle, shortly called Orac, as it is a key element of the game. The Oracle is almighty ancient monument, eternal apprentice of the nature itself and the hand of the gods among humans and beasts. The Oracle provides advantages to the players (every day a different one) and it could support them, if they catch the lucky moment on a sunny day... It counts the days and guides the leaders through the never-ending competition between the folks that inhabit these lands: The B&auml;rfolk, The Emberians, The Islanders and The Cloudborn.&#10;Four factions coexist in the world of Battalia. Most of the cards in the game (units, artefacts and terrain cards) and the 8 figures belong to one of the four factions. A leading concept in the game is that the four factions can freely collaborate with each other, but many units from the same faction, using their own artefacts, are much stronger together. Also, unlike all other games where the players choose their factions, in this game the factions choose the players...&#10;&#10;",

They also had a force of MiG fighter jets.&#10;&#10;Covering air operations from 1965 to 1972, Downtown simulates the clashes between American air power and the North Vietnamese air defence system. The United States player controls Air Force and Navy strikes into Route Packs 5 and 6 - the heart of the Vietnamese defences.&#10;&#10;Packages include forces of bombers, fighters, recon planes, jamming aircraft and &quot;Iron Hand&quot; aircraft for suppression of enemy air defenses (SEAD). The US player's objective is to destroy ground targets. They can only succeed by integrating all the package elements to complete the mission with minimal loss.&#10;&#10;The North Vietnamese player controls concentrations of AAA, Fire Can radar-directed artillery and SAM .

Mounted game boards, laminated full color ship control cards and gorgeous full color counters highlight this re-imagining of the Star Fleet Universe with 21st century production values.&#10;&#10;This was the initial product for Federation Commander, and was the original base set.  There are other base sets and expansions for the Federation Commander Series.&#10;&#10;Much effort has gone into streamlining the game - there are 8 impulses rather than 32.  One die roll allocates up to 10 points of damage, rather than 2 dice per damage point that strikes the ship.   Color coded charts and ship cards reduce the mental overhead of remembering what goes where.&#10;&#10;Gone is the tax form of energy allocation, replaced by a free flowing dynamic &quot;on the fly&quot; power allocation system.  Maneuver has had countless special cases removed and streamlined.&#10;&#10;This is not an introduction to Star Fleet Battles, but a re-imagining of starship combat in the Star Fleet Universe, redesigned from the ground up to appeal to a wider audience and reduce rules lawyer-ism.&#10;&#10;Included in the rules are the 'free form&quot; (hexless) movement rules that have been in use for years; the hex map is scaled for miniatures bases, and the game is designed to be easy to port over to miniatures adaptations.&#10;&#10;",

On your turn, you either draw cards or build floors. If you draw cards, the total value of the drawn cards cannot exceed 3. (Cards have values between 1 and 3.)&#10;&#10;If you build floors, you MUST play two cards from your hand. The number of one of the cards determines exactly how many floors you will build, and the color of the other card determines the color of those same floors. Thus, with only three cards in hand, you have six different possibilities for building; with more cards, your options increase even more! Building gives you the possibility of scoring points but also opens new possibilities for your opponents because buildings do not belong to any player. You might start a building that can be completed by other players, and it is this risk management that makes Porto a very interactive game in which paying attention to the moves of your opponents is crucial.&#10;&#10;Build floors, gain bonus points by completing houses or by constructing in the most crucial spaces, fulfill public contracts by building at crucial moments and by chaining combos to make a very profitable turn, shape the city so that it complies with your private contracts in order to maximize them at the end of the game, but above all, capitalize on opportunities opened by your opponents on the board. That said, in Porto any missed opportunity will lead to a new array of possibilities.&#10;&#10;The game end is triggered at the end of the round in which a certain number of buildings have been completed.

    "description": "Battleship Galaxies is a space combat miniatures game that is a distant cousin to the original Battleship game. The two opposing forces represented in the game, the human Intergalactic Space Navy and the alien Wretcheridians, are represented by 20 starship miniatures. There are figures for several different ship types and each has an individual reference card that defines the characteristics (e.g., weapons, movement, shields) of that ship.&#10;&#10;The game is scenario driven and each scenario defines the goal of the game as well as the initial setup of the starfield hex board. Each turn, players have a certain number of energy points that can be spent to perform actions such as movement or firing. Combat is resolved by rolling special dice: a 10-sided die with letters and an eight-sided die with numbers. The resulting letter-number combination is compared to the target ship&rsquo;s reference card to determine the result. Hits on a ship are indicated by placing colored pegs in the figure&rsquo;s base.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "&quot;Silent War&quot; is a solitaire wargame simulation of the United States' submarine war against Imperial Japan during the Second World War. The scenarios allow players to recreate various stages of the war or the entire campaign. In each of these scenarios, the player takes on the role of Commander Submarines, US Pacific Fleet (ComSubPac), deploying available submarines from either Pearl Harbor or Brisbane in order to attack the Japanese Navy. Additionally, in the patrol game, using single submarines, players can recreate some of the war's most famous patrols. The amount of flexibility the game allows the player is tremendous, a single submarine patrol can be completed in 10 minutes, the various campaigns can be completed in 10 or more hours depending on which campaign you play and your progress as commander.&#10;&#10;Every American submarine that was deployed to the Pacific in World War II has its own oversize easy to handle counter in the game. Each counter has the correct side view illustration in color for that class of submarine. The game map covers the huge expanse of the Pacific Theater of submarine operations from the Aleutians to Australia and from Samoa to the Sea of Japan. The map encapsulates most of the information a player needs to play, with a unique set of easy to use graphic charts. The rules will have the player running his first submarine patrol within 45 minutes of opening the game box.&#10;&#10;Special rules include American torpedo improvement, ultra, submarine repair and readiness, wolfpacks, campaign and combat events, war progress, patrol and search, TDC solutions, merchant shipping, Japanese battleship doctrine, two player rules and more.&#10;&#10;Can you as a submarine fleet commander best the historical submarine commanders and sink more ships and tonnage than the American commanders or will you wash out and be retired to a desk job?&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;     1 28&quot;x22&quot; map&#10;     5 counter sheets, mounted, die cut and full color printed on both sides:&#10;         3&frac12; sheets of long (1.3&quot;x0.65&quot;) submarine counters&#10;         1&frac12; sheets of large (0.65&quot;x0.65&quot;) counters.&#10;    &#10;     4 8&frac12;&quot;x11&quot; full-color play-aid charts and displays:&#10;         1 single-sided combat display&#10;         1 single-sided submarine tender display&#10;         1 tables and charts display&#10;         1 counter explanation chart/sub comparison chart&#10;    &#10;     1 24-page rules book&#10;     1 24-page scenario book&#10;     1 10-sided die&#10;     1 full color box and lid&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Scopa is a traditional Italian card game (actually a family of card games that includes Scopone, Scopetta, and Scopone Scientifico) played in regions of Italy for over 400 years.  The game is played with a 40-card Italian deck (similar to a conventional deck minus either the 8s, 9s, and 10s or alternatively, the Js,  Qs, and Ks).  Four-player games are usually played in partnership; other numbers of players typically play for themselves.&#10;&#10;In the original Scopa base game, four cards are turned face up on the table, and players are dealt hands of three cards.  On their turn, a player may capture any of the face-up cards on the table if the sum of the cards captured equals the value of the card played.  If a player cannot make a capture, they must discard a card face-up onto the table.  Cards are progressively handed out in lots of three until the deck is exhausted.&#10;&#10;When the deck is exhausted, scoring is calculated.  Players earn 1 point for &quot;sweeping&quot; the table, that is, for clearing the table of all face-up cards; 1 point for capturing the most cards; 1 point for capturing the most cards of the coin suit; 1 point for capturing the 7 of coins (the &quot;settebello&quot;); and 1 point for the best &quot;primiera,&quot; that is, the best assemblage of high-value cards from each of the four suits.&#10;&#10;The game is traditionally played until a player or team reaches a set number of points, usually 11 or 21.&#10; The name &quot;Scopa&quot; means &quot;sweep&quot; or &quot;broom&quot; in Italian, and refers to the action of picking up all face-up cards on the table.&#10;&#10;In some ways, Scopa can be thought of as a precursor to many popular modern game designs.  The multiple competing goals and the limited hand-size make for a very modern-feeling game.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Gelb gewinnt!&#10;    Der Goldene Kompass: Das Kartenspiel zum Film&#10;    Shokoba&#10;    Templaria&#10;    Punto&#10;    Casino&#10;    Frog Juice&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Fortunes will be made and fame will rise.

This will result in political offices being gained and lost, new vocations learned, new land acquired, or new buildings constructed. The end result is a vibrant community revered near and wide &mdash; but only the player who has best balanced their wealth and prestige will emerge the final victor.&#10;&#10;Playing time is 15-20 minutes per player.&#10;&#10;",

The game lasts a number of rounds depending on the player count, and on a turn you roll dice based on how you've developed your empire board. The six sides of the dice correspond to the five abilities on your board. To expand to new territories or invade opponents, you need to unlock movement ability; to annex a territory, you have to outnumber the current occupant or have a &quot;sword&quot; result on the dice, with the inhabitants then fleeing elsewhere. The dice also allow you develop your player board by using the die face that corresponds to the improvement and controlling an associated territory. You can gain more dice and additional re-rolls, while also unlocking achievement cards.&#10;&#10;At game's end, you earn points based on played achievement cards, points unlocked on your personal board, and the sum of cities under your control.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Starship Troopers is based upon the popular novel of the same name written by the dean of Science-Fiction writers, Robert A. Heinlein. In the novel, Heinlein describes a futuristic war involving homo sapiens from our Earth (Terrans) against a Humanoid race (nicknamed the 'Skinnies' for obvious physical attributes) and their cobelligerents, the totally alien Arachnids. Since this is a story of future wars and future advances in technology, much is changed in the fields of weaponry and tactics and strategy. One thing remains the same, however; the fighting still rests on the shoulders of the individual infantryman. Although great starships has shuttle men between the distant solar systems and the power of individual weapons has risen to awesome heights, wars still cannot be won unless men venture onto the face of alien planets and fight the enemy on their home ground. As Juan Rico, the protagonist of the novel, relates:&#10;&#10;&quot;We are the boys who go to a particular place, at H-Hour, occupy a designated terrain, stand on it, dig the enemy out of their holes, force them then and there to surrender or die. We're the bloody infantry, the doughboy, the duckfoot, the foot soldier who goes where the enemy is and takes him on in person.&quot;&#10;&#10;Although the mission remains the same, future inventiveness has changed the method considerably. In a galaxy-wide war, manpower is at a premium. Platoons fight where entire armies once tred. But these platoons possess the firepower equivalence of a Twentieth-Century mechanized division. More importantly, each man in the platoon is provided with a piece of hardware that allows him to fight and survive in the holocausts of future combat&mdash;his powered armor suit. As Rico describes it:&#10;&#10;&quot;A suit isn't a spacesuit &mdash; although it can serve as one. A suit is not a space ship but it can fly&mdash;a little . . . Suited up, you look like a big steel gorilla, armed with gorillasized weapons. But the suits are considerably stronger than a gorilla. If a Mobile Infantry man in a suit swapped hugs with a gorilla, the gorilla would be dead, crushed; the man and the suit wouldn't be mussed . . . The real genius in the design is that you don't have to control the suit, you just wear it, like your clothes, like skin . . . Even riding a bicycle demands an acquired skill, very different from walking. But a suit you just wear.&quot;&#10;&#10;With the suit and the incredible array of weaponry that go with it, the Mobile Infantry soldier is an exceedingly formidable opponent. He had better be. The enemies he faces are the most awesome adversaries in the galaxy. Of the two extraterrestrial races fighting the Terrans, the Humanoids are the least revolting. Rico describes them as&#10;&#10;&quot; . . . humanoid, eight or nine feet tall, much skinnier than we are and with a higher body temperature; they don't wear any clothes and they stand out in a set of 'snoopers' like a neon sign.&quot;&#10;&#10;In early scenarios they are fighting on the side of the Arachnids.  In later scenarios, after successful negotiations with Earth, they switch over to the Terran side. They're only effective fighters within the confines of their small city terrain and strong points on the board.&#10;&#10;But the 'Skinnies' were mild looking in comparison to the Arachnids:&#10;&#10;&quot;The 'Bugs' are not like us. The Pseudo-Arachnids aren't even like spiders. They are arthropods who happen to look like a madman's concept of a giant, intelligent spider, but their organization, psychological and economic, is more like that of ants or termites; they are communal entities, the ultimate dictatorship of the hive . . . But don't make the mistake of thinking that they act purely from instinct . . . their actions are as intelligent as ours (stupid races don't build spaceships!) and were much better coordinated. It takes a minimum of a year to train a private to fight and to mesh his fighting with his mates; a Bug warrior is hatched able to do this ...&quot;&#10;&#10;As the Arachnid Player, uses an Alien Control Pad sheet to record the placement of his underground central Hive cell complex and the attached tunnels radiating outward. Tunnels are used to move the Warrior units, along with Worker units mixed in as expendable decoys, to locations where they can pop up to the surface through a breach hole and attack the Terran units.  Completely unseen, and only paper recorded, Engineer units are used to create the breaches and, later, to extend the tunnels.&#10;&#10;The game is set up in a &quot;Programmed Instruction&quot; system of scenarios to slowly introduce the game concepts. Scenarios range from Scenario I, which starts players off with a basic MI raid on a Skinny city (just like the book. &quot;Flores died on the way up&quot;) to Scenario VII, The Battle of Klendathu: the final Terran assault on the Arachnid Homeworld.&#10;&#10;Warfare in the Twenty-second Century is the ultimate test of survivability of the human race. It was a very near thing.&#10;&#10;Avalon Hill Complexity rating - 5&#10;&#10;",

Sets have varying numbers of cards in them, from Mike Heitler with four cards up to Al Capone with eight.&#10;&#10;The four types of gavel card make cards accessible everywhere: &quot;Agent Meeting&quot; searches other players' hands, &quot;Eliot Ness&quot; searches the deck, &quot;Search Warrant&quot; looks in the discard pile, and &quot;Raid&quot; allows you to take an opponent's already melded cards, provided you have at least three melded. All these mechanisms help make completing entire sets for their bonuses something you can reasonably strive for &ndash; while also putting you on guard against your opponent doing the same.&#10;&#10;",

Sounds simple enough, right?&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, each player has fifteen balls, either light or dark, and they take turns placing them on a game board that has sixteen indentations on it in a 4x4 grid. Once four balls have been placed next to one another in a square, a ball can be placed on top of them, forming a second level of play. Players can then place balls on this second level, eventually allowing a ball to be placed on the third level &ndash; and once that level is full, which requires only four balls, a final ball can be placed on the fourth level, with that player winning the game.&#10;&#10;If a player forms a square of his own color &ndash; that is, four balls placed next to one another on the same level &ndash; that player can remove one or two of his balls (that don't support anything) from anywhere on the board and place them in his reserve, thereby giving him more balls to place in the future. Whenever a player forms a square that's not entirely his own color, he can &quot;stack&quot; one of his pieces &ndash; that is, he can take any ball and place it on this square, locking some pieces in place and making a move without having to place a piece from his reserve.&#10;&#10;The rules include a variant for children (that removes the square bonus) and one for experts (that allows a player to return 1-2 balls to his reserve when he creates a line of his color).&#10;&#10;Reimplements&#10;&#10;&#10;    Strat-O-Sphere&#10;&#10;&#10;",

In this game, players colonize the galaxy using their ships, which they move on a modular board containing hexagonal spaces (systems). The modular board is made up of seven different double-sided sector tiles, which allows for a different map and different experience each time you play the game.&#10;&#10;During a turn, a player must move one of their ships on the board. They can move the ship only in a straight line, as far away as they want, but they cannot go over systems controlled by other players. After moving the ship, the player has to choose whether to place a colony or a trade station in that system. Both of these mark control over the system until the end of the game, but the trade station gives the player bonus points for each adjacent system controlled by their opponents. The game ends when either all of the players have placed their colonies and trade stations on the board or until none of the players' ships can move (because they have become blocked by other players' systems).&#10;&#10;After the game ends, points are calculated. Each player gets one point for each planet that they have in their systems. (Systems have 1 to 3 planets on the board.) Players also earn points for Nebulae; the more they have from one color, the more points they earn, with bonus points from other special systems such as the Unexplored System Tiles, which are part of a variant in the game. After calculating the points, the player with the most points wins!&#10;&#10;",

By the end of the game, each player will have created a unique, custom neighborhood with areas that interact with each other, hoping to outscore the competition by having the best subdivision.&#10;&#10;In the game, each player starts with a subdivision player board and a hand of hex-shaped zone tiles. A parcel die is rolled to indicate the type of parcel where a zone tile may be placed, and all players simultaneously place one of their tiles. If a zone tile is placed next to existing zone tiles, those existing tiles have the ability to create new improvements, which may also be placed at this time. Those improvements provide money and points, while slowly covering up as many parcels as possible. Players pass the remaining zone tiles in hand to their left, then someone rolls the parcel die once again. This continues until only one zone tile remains in hand, which is discarded.&#10;&#10;Players then play another round, but at the start of the second, third, and fourth rounds, players first check to see whether they've achieved bonuses, which give them extra cash or allow for extra activations of certain zone tiles.&#10;&#10;After four rounds, the game ends, and scores are tallied, with players gaining points for parks being adjacent to other tiles, sidewalks passing through as many different zones and improvements as possible, schools ranking the best in the city, and zones connecting to the highway that runs around (or through) your subdivision.&#10;&#10;",

In Sweden, there is an expression for this &ldquo;Rich as a troll&rdquo;.&#10;Trolls were not evil if you didn&rsquo;t treat them badly, they could even be helpful to those who treated them well. But they often played tricks on humans. Their magic power (trollkraft) could distort the vision of humans so the troll looked like a human, an animal, a log, and a stone and even become invisible. But they also had some weaknesses. They couldn&rsquo;t stand the sounds of church bells or steel, not to mention the sight of sun.&#10;&#10;Trolls &amp; Princesses is a &ldquo;worker movement&rdquo; game. You play as one of four troll clans and to get the mountains king&rsquo;s favour, you try to impress him. The players get favour (in the form of victory points) when they do what trolls usually do: swap changelings, &ldquo;hire&rdquo; humans, tear down church bells, kidnap princesses, build their cave, and use troll magic. To succeed, the players must collect resources and move around their trolls to do different actions. The player with the most victory points at the end can crown himself the ultimate troll clan leader.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Pixel Tactics 3 can be played as a standalone game or used to expand previous Pixel Tactics games. It also comes with new play modes such as Epic Constructed (60-card decks), Cube Draft, and more that you can access by combining all three Pixel Tactics games (plus any mini-expansions)! Pixel Tactics 3 contains 25 new heroes including:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Gerard Matranga / Mercenary &ndash; Ignore wave restrictions on attacking!&#10;    Alice Zero / Failsafe &ndash; Who allows you to switch leaders mid-game!&#10;    Arret Draamivaar / Dispatcher &ndash; Recruit up to 14 heroes at once!&#10;    Cherri Seneca / Dreamseer &ndash; Drawing cards is a free action for you!&#10;    Udstad / Golem &ndash; Forces your opponents to flee in terror!&#10;&#10;&#10;Pixel Tactics 3 is a head-to-head game of tactical combat for two players. Each player has an identical deck of 25 cards, from which they draft a leader. The leader's abilities alter vastly the strategy and playability of every other card in the deck, making the game playable in 25 different ways.&#10;&#10;In the game, players take turns placing cards and attacking. Each card can activate in various ways, taking on offensive capabilities in the front rows of the unit, or support powers in the back rows. Cards can also be played as orders &ndash; powerful single-time effects that can turn the tide of battle.&#10;&#10;Play continues until either player's leader is defeated. A typical game is best of three or five rounds.&#10;&#10;",

Hordes of enemies are crossing the borders, famine spreads throughout the provinces and the political intrigues are tearing the empire apart from within. The previous emperor was killed by his own Praetorian bodyguard and has left a power vacuum that the powerful families in Rome are trying to fill. Are you ready to don the purple yourself and take on the stressful job as emperor? If you fail, the other families are ready to take over at a moment's notice. While they wait for your doom, they won't hesitate to backstab or undermine you as much as they can. However you all have to work together as the fall of the Roman Empire is closing in.&#10;&#10;Donning the Purple is an asymmetrical king of the hill game with a bit of worker placement. Each player leads a powerful family in ancient Rome, trying to get the most victory points during 4 rounds. If your family member becomes the emperor and manages to hold the position he can earn lots of points. However he will also become the target of the other players as they will try to dethrone him and become the new emperor themselves.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "It is the middle of the nineteenth century and the age of steam is well underway. The Russian and Canadian governments, eager to capitalize on the new rail technology to bring together their vast countries, are sponsoring entrepreneurs to help build their railway networks. You are an investor, seeking to take advantage of their generous offer to make your fortune. However, your governments are not as benevolent as you first thought. They have begun to absorb fledgling rail companies, taking them away from those who worked so hard to build them by regulating impossible standards for new technology. You will have to remain diligent to ensure you are not next.&#10;&#10;In 2005, Ian D. Wilson released 1861: Railways of the Russian Empire inspired by the railway development of Russia. In 2015, he released 1867: Railways of Canada, which is a standalone game that uses 1861's core rules on a different map with a handful of variations to gameplay. Both are classic examples of the versatile 18xx system of train games. They are straightforward enough to be your 1st 18xx game while still offering the depth you want in your 100th game.&#10;&#10;1861 and 1867 are perfect as weeknight games as they can usually be played by experienced players in 3 hours. The games are staples at 18xx gaming conventions often as a palate cleanser after playing a longer title. What makes 1861/1867 in particular great entry points into the 18xx system is that the two games introduce the different game mechanics in phases. The beginning of a game only has Minor Companies running relatively simple operations and as the game progresses, new mechanisms like Merger Rounds and the National Railway are introduced. They are great games to learn, have a steady but ever increasing trajectory and speed, and pack enough of a wallop to keep players returning to them time and time again.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "You are the leader of a prehistoric tribe, deciding which members of your tribe go hunting and what prey they want to catch. To guide you, the Elders have created challenges that you can complete by painting on the wall of your cave.&#10;&#10;Each round in Prehistories, you and your fellow tribe leaders bid simultaneously (and secretly) to decide who hunts where. The more hunters you have, the bigger the game you can catch, but the slower you are. The fastest player &mdash; that is, the one with the smallest sum of hunters &mdash; goes first, but they have few hunters with which to hunt. To hunt, you assign your hunters to one or more locations to catch the prey waiting there. Prey is represented by polyomino tiles, and the larger the tile, the higher the sum required. If you have just enough hunters to catch your prey, they might be wounded in the process, which means you'll draw fewer hunter cards at the end of the round to refill your hand. (They distrust your leadership when you get them injured!)&#10;&#10;In the second phase of a round, you paint your cave with the animal tiles collected during the hunting phase. Your cave is represented by a 7x7 grid that starts with a few tiles already in place. The first tile you place goes in the left-hand column, and all subsequent tiles must touch tiles already placed, with all tiles being oriented so that the animals are viewed with their legs (or fins) down. (Cavemen have simple tastes and want everything to be representational.)&#10;&#10;When you fulfill the wishes of the Elders by painting your cave in certain ways &mdash; such as completing a horizontal line or connecting opposing corners or surrounding a legendary animal on all sides &mdash; you place one or more totem tokens on that challenge. Whoever first discards their eight totem tokens wins.&#10;&#10;",

On your turn, you must not play a suit that has already been played (unless it is a gold card). The highest number played wins, but gold is the trump suit and always wins. Whoever played the lowest non-gold card adds a gold card of the same number from the supply to their collection if it is available. All gold cards played in a trick are returned to the supply.&#10;&#10;The round ends immediately when a player cannot play a valid base metal card and does not have a gold card to play or chooses not to play a gold card. If you win more tricks than you bid, you earn your bid value as points; if you met your bid exactly, you earn twice your bid value as points. Additionally, you earn points for the number of gold cards in your collection. The player/team with the most points wins a gold nugget, and the first to collect two nuggets wins!&#10;&#10;",

You'll need to pick a board, paddle out, look for waves, and ride them in to score points!&#10;&#10;Tavarua is played over a number of short rounds. In each round waves advance towards shore, players simultaneously select then resolve actions by playing cards, and a wave card is revealed and resolved. Rounds continue until there are no more wave cards in the wave deck, at which point the game ends and one player claims victory.&#10;&#10;Goal&#10;The goal of the game is to win the grand champion trophy, by having the highest scoring waves. You score points by catching and riding waves, but you may only keep your top two wave scores for each board type. General gameplay involves looking for a wave to ride, paddling to the wave, catching the wave, riding the wave, then scoring the wave. When the game ends, three trophies are given out, whoever gets the Grand Champion trophy wins!&#10;&#10;Looking For a Wave&#10;At the start of each round all the wave tiles advance one space towards the shore. When looking for a wave to catch, you&rsquo;ll need to remember that you can only catch a broken wave. Waves are either unbroken, or broken. Waves with a die number less than their space in the break are unbroken. Waves with a die number equal to or higher than their space in the break are broken.&#10;&#10;Paddling to a Wave&#10;Paddling moves your surfer in the channel. You can play any card to paddle, the number on the card determines how many spaces you move.&#10;&#10;Catching a Wave&#10;You can only catch the wave that&rsquo;s in the same space in the break as your surfer is in the channel. To catch a wave, you&rsquo;ll need to play a card. The number and direction on the card will shift your balance. When catching a wave you&rsquo;ll want to look at the top card of the wave deck to determine which card to play. You want to play a card that will shift your balance so that you do not wipeout during the Wave / Score phase. You now move your surfer/surfboard onto the wave tile (standing your surfer up) and finally move your played card over to your score pile.&#10;&#10;Riding a Wave&#10;Once you&rsquo;ve caught a wave you are considered to be riding it. While riding, your goal is to maintain your balance, while maximizing scored points. Cards you play will both shift your balance, and count as your score for the wave. The higher the number on the card, the more points it&rsquo;s worth, however the more difficult it will be to maintain your balance. After you play and shift your balance, a wave card will be revealed, and it too will shift your balance. Be careful: if your balance token moves one or more spaces off the nose or tail of your surfboard, you&rsquo;ll wipeout!&#10;&#10;Scoring a Wave &#10;When riding a wave: cards played are not discarded, but placed into your score pile. The numbers on the cards determines the score value of that wave. When you stop riding a wave you will score it during the &ldquo;Wave / Score&rdquo; phase of that round. To score a wave take one of your color score tokens, with the board you&rsquo;re currently riding, and place it on score track at the number equal to your wave score point value, then discard all the cards/tokens in your score pile.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Titans is a territory control miniatures game for 1-4 players (up to 5 with an expansion).&#10;&#10;The game is set in a historical fantasy setting of 17th century Europe. Endless wars are taking their toll as the people fall into despair. There is no hope for an end, no prospects for a peaceful order. The faith of the people slowly burns out. Dorment Spirits of the Nations wake up from centuries-long rest, rekindling the hearts of the people and raising ancient warriors called the Titans. People, filled with extraordinary powers, standing hand-by-hand with mighty Titans, fight to reclaim Europe. That war will end it all, and a King of Kings will be chosen.&#10;&#10;In Titans players take roles of a king that leads an Army with a mythical Titan into Battle. There are 4 Nations to choose from, one of the European empires of that time - Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, Russia, Sweden, and the Ottoman Empire.&#10;&#10;The game revolves around a unique, yet simple Order Card Mechanics. Players will use a shared deck of Order Cards that will allow them to recruit Units, awake the Nation&rsquo;s Power and move their Armies across the Game Board. Players draw a specific number of Order Cards and place them face-up for all players to see. Players also see the upcoming Order Cards so they can plan their long=term strategy.  In his turn, the active player chooses 1 of the available Order Cards and uses it's available Actions. Players will try to gain strategic positions, move their front line and attack their opponents where they are the weakest. The next player uses the same Pool of Order Cards so the active player may try to anticipate opponents movement and use that to their advantage. When there is only 1 Order Card available it's discarded, the &quot;upcoming Order Cards&quot; become the available pool and new Order Cards are drawn. That allows for dynamic gameplay with a lot of planning, both tactical and strategical.&#10;&#10;The game is divided into Rounds and the Round ends after the Order Deck is empty. After each Round players collect Victory Points for the Regions they control, so players constantly want to expand their domain. Winning Battles also bring players Victory Points so deciding when, where and how to attack is crucial as well. The player with the most Victory Points at the end of the game is the winner.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

As a supervisor of this company, you&rsquo;ll be expected to not only build these ships and satisfy our guests, but also to help the company thrive by enhancing our company network, inventing new technologies, and growing our workforce.  We are a united company, and you&rsquo;ll often find that what another supervisor does will make your job easier. Let me be clear, though, this is a competition. Our current CEO will be stepping down in three years, and the supervisor who comes out on top will take his place.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you will either place a worker to take two actions in the ever-expanding network, launch a ship and send one of your workers to space as a pilot, or recall all your earthbound workers to collect funding bonuses. Actions include acquiring blueprints, constructing ships, attracting guests, and building developments&ndash;connections between locations that increase action selection throughout the game. You will also be affecting resource markets that ebb and flow with the actions of all the players.&#10;&#10;When you launch a ship, one of your workers will accompany it as a pilot, navigating the ship to various destinations and &ldquo;days in space,&rdquo; where guests will reward you for all your hard work.&#10;&#10;Throughout the game, you will also be competing with your fellow supervisors to complete company goals, which will earn you progress cubes throughout the game. Progress cubes are also placed when you launch ships, and when a certain number of cubes are placed onto the company&rsquo;s progress track, the game ends, and the player with the most Victory Points becomes the new CEO of Galactic Cruise.&#10;&#10;Do you still think you have what it takes to work for us?

    "description": "Once rare and mysterious, now thankfully back in print, Polarity is a 2-player game using lots of magnets (so keep it away from credit cards, watches and so on). The plastic coated pieces look like Reversi/Othello discs, with black and white faces. Each piece contains a magnet, with the black side being North and the white side being South. Each player gets a stack, one plays black one plays white. A neutral red piece goes in the center of the game cloth and players start by place five each of their stack around the cloth. These flat pieces are the foundations.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you take one piece from your stack into your hand, then bring it to bear against one of your foundations. You keep your color face up, so the opposing polarity bears against your foundation piece. This way, you can very carefully balance your new piece in the air against the foundation stone! This is just fantastic to see. The board fills up with lots of discs teetering at 45 degrees, ready to fly about if the balances are upset.&#10;&#10;Get it right and your stack is one piece smaller. Make a mistake and  your turn ends. Either a piece falls flat somewhere (becoming a new foundation) or pieces jump together making towers or into your hand. Your opponent takes the tower you accidentally made and places it their side up where they like. Towers get you points at the game end.&#10;&#10;If a piece jumps to the stone in your hand, they both go back on your stack. The game ends when one player finishes their stack and points are calculated based upon towers and discs remaining. Causing the red piece to jump to another loses you the game outright.&#10;&#10;To be honest, the scoring matters less than the tension and joy of watching the natural but weird force of magnetism at play. Because the discs are discs, they can easily roll around, causing domino effects. Because the towers increase the magnetic pull, they make it so much harder to find a safe spot to play.&#10;&#10;If you want a strange fun game to amaze your friends and family, Polarity is hard to beat. If you want a serious 2-player game, you may prefer other abstracts. The rules could do with being shorter and simpler. Otherwise, a joyous game.&#10;&#10;Comment from the designer &quot;Polarity began as a sculpture. Polarity is zen. It represents that point where absolute opposites merge. In this case, the poles of the magnetic field. The quality of play is determined by one's ability to perceive balance in the midst of extremes. Each game is unique and can never be reproduced. It is in that uniqueness that I was awarded a patent from the U.S. Pat. &amp; Trdmks. office for magnetic principle. The strategy must be viewed 3-dimensionally. It is not just control of a 2-dimensional board but must include the space above and below the playing surface.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

The Outpost has to win a few battles, slow down the march of Moloch as much as possible, and prepare to welcome robots in New York City.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Cartagena takes as its theme the famous 1672 pirate-led jailbreak from the fortress of Cartagena. Each player has a group of six pirates, and you want to be the first to have all six escape through the tortuous underground passage that connects the fortress to the port, where a sloop is waiting for them.&#10;&#10;To move a pirate, you need to play a card from your hand. Each card bears one of six symbols (gun, rum, parrot, etc.), and when you play a card, you move one of your pirates forward to the next matching symbol in the tunnel, leapfrogging over matching symbols where another pirate already stands. The only way to get more cards, however, is to move backwards; more specifically, you move one of your pirates backwards to the first space that holds one or two pirates, drawing one or two cards after doing so. Each turn, you take 1-3 actions, whether moving forward or backward or both. When you move a pirate to the end of the track, it jumps on the sloop where it must await the other pirates in its crew. With every step toward victory, though, you have fewer and fewer pirates to move each turn, possibly locking you in to actions you don't want, so be sure to plan ahead and not leave yourself empty-handed!&#10;&#10;This version of Cartagena includes the classic base game mixed with Cartagena 2. The Pirate's Nest and several new variants. The game includes eight double-sided game boards, and to play the base game you use only six of them. Use more boards for a longer game, or fewer boards (and possibly fewer pirates) for a shorter game. To replicate Cartagena 2, you can flip over three or more of the game boards to create a secondary path that's separate from the first one. Now when you place pirates in the sloop, you can use an action to move the sloop to the start of the second path &mdash; and with two paths, you have a harder time making huge jumps from start to finish.&#10;&#10;&quot;Morgan&quot; is a variant in which players can now draw cards by moving an opponent's pirate ahead, drawing one or two cards when the pirate stops at the first space that contains one or two pirates; this variant and all others can be used in any version of the game. With the &quot;Filibusters&quot; variant, whenever someone plays one of the twelve cards with a dark background, everyone other than the active player must discard until they have at most seven cards in hand.&#10;&#10;Finally, the &quot;Black Magic Woman&quot; variant introduces special powers to the six symbols on the card, and when you play a card, you can use it for pirate movement like normal or use the card' power. You can play two parrots as if they were any other symbol, or use a lantern to look at the top four cards and keep one of your choice. With the gun, you steal a card of your choice from an opponent's hand, with them getting one free draw in return. The treasure chest symbol lets you pick up the treasure chest from the space where you stand, most likely drawing cards from the deck as a bonus, but possibly suffering a snakebite that will have you running back for rum to help you forget the pain!&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Since the beginning of time, two opposing forces have been the pillars of the universe and coexist in eternal balance. Our Goddess in her infinite wisdom has sent a group of Overseers to protect our world. They have the power to bend human traits to their will, and they will always battle between each other to create the perfect symmetry between virtues and vices of humankind. You will now choose whether to find the best balance &mdash; or completely crush it for your own good.&#10;&#10;Overseers is a drafting and bluffing game with a twist. Each player represents an Overseer whose objective is to bend traits in their favor to create the most dominant combination of virtues and vices. The game has three main phases:&#10;&#10;1] Drafting: Each player receives six cards at random from the deck, selects one of them, then passes the rest to the player sitting on their left. The goal is to build up the combination that will grant them the most victory points. Some cards grant points on their own, while others require the same type of cards to earn more points.&#10;&#10;2] Judgement: All players place their five trait cards in front of them in two rows: two face down and three face up to show the cards they chose. Give the information available, the Overseers then discuss which player has the strongest possible combination. After deliberating, players vote for this person using their token. The chosen player must then admit or deny the verdict:&#10;&#10;&mdash; If they admit having the strongest combination, they must then discard two cards from their combination.&#10;&mdash; If they deny this, the showdown phase happens, with all players revealing their scores. If the chosen player has the strongest combination, they lose the two cards that grant the most points; if not, instead they take one additional card of their choice from the discard pile.&#10;&#10;3] Scoring: Each player shows all cards in front of them, then calculates their score.&#10;&#10;The game might have other phases depending on the type of overseers being played as each character has special abilities that can change the outcome of the game, such as being able to peek at another player's hidden cards, steal a card before the scoring phase, or transform one card into another.&#10;&#10;At the end of each round, players secret their victory point (VP) tokens to keep their score secret, and after three rounds whoever has the most VPs wins.&#10;&#10;",

The Kraken plans to make a nice stew out of them. Can you prise open his tentacles, release your friends, and defeat him? Hope so. Oh, it's probably not a good time to mention the shark...&#10;&#10;Poseidon's Kingdom features a wave that crashes dice onto the board and the engaging game play of the highly-praised anthill system (from Antics!). On their turns, players first decide whether to improve their abilities by taking an &quot;action tile&quot; or place some of their personal dice onto the big 3D-wave, which is rolled over, when full, distributing up to 15 dice in a couple of seconds randomly all over the board.&#10;&#10;Second, they move one of their two creatures on the main board, trying to land on a spot where they can pick up dice of any color they need. If they do, they can either store the dice on special spaces of their action tiles for later use OR put together a special combination of 2-4 dice to get victory point tokens, then place the dice back to the pools from where they came.&#10;&#10;Third, the shark moves as many spaces as the space the creature landed on indicates. If the shark meets one or more creatures on its way, they are eaten and players get &quot;skeletons&quot; to block one of their action spaces.&#10;&#10;After a special scoring round, in the end the player who collected the most victory points wins.&#10;&#10;The second edition of Poseidon's Kingdom introduces the dolphin, which can make your creatures immune to the shark.&#10;&#10;",

Typically, the player who played the highest empire card chooses an egg first, then the player with the second highest empire card, and so on until all revealed eggs are collected, if possible. However, each empire card has a unique power that can affect the order in which eggs are selected. The powers interact in strategic and awesome ways so that every hand is exciting and fun!&#10;&#10;Outwit your opponents to collect as many good eggs as possible &mdash; that is, ones worth victory points (VPs) &mdash; while avoiding those nasty exploding eggs!

It offers a dynamic play experience where players have to react and adjust their strategy accordingly. Each player starts with a small deck of cards, and uses those cards to acquire more and better cards for their deck, with the goal of earning the most Honor Points by gaining cards and defeating monsters.&#10;&#10;Ascension: Gift of the Elements is the eleventh standalone game in the Ascension series, although the game can be combined with other titles for play with up to six players. This set sees the return of Events from Storm of Souls and Immortal Heroes; Events enter the game via the center deck and create an immediate impact for all players. However, unlike in previous sets, Events can now be acquired and transformed into powerful Hero cards.&#10;&#10;This set introduces two new mechanisms: infest and empower. Infest allows you to mess with an opponent's deck, forcing them to draw useless cards. This gameplay feature can slow down a player that jumps out early and introduces a strategic element not seen in previous sets. Players can counter this infestation through Empower cards. When the player acquires an Empower card, they may banish a card played that turn (i.e., using the card, then eliminating it). This added flexibility creates a lasting impact in each game.&#10;&#10;",

Anyway, so the villagers rebuilt all the buildings in the town (including their precious outhouses), but forgot to include city walls, a river, or roads.  To rectify this, players lay tiles with one of these three things onto the board, and any building caught underneath them is automatically eliminated, except for outhouses.  When an outhouse would be destroyed, players take a vote on whether to place that particular section.  Each player is trying to retain the most of one type of building, and once all the pieces have been placed the winner is the person with the highest valued buildings still standing.&#10;&#10;Wacky, Wacky West re-make description:&#10;&#10;Fans of Klaus Teuber will be interested in this remake/redesign of Drunter und Dr&uuml;ber, a 1991 Spiel des Jahres winner.&#10;&#10;&#10;Just south of nowhere, there's the junction of the Mayfair &amp; Rossdorf RR and the Turvy Trunk Line. Springing up from the desert like a tumbleweed lies the eccentric little town of Rossdorf. Like most western towns, Rossdorf has a Land Agent: Guy Dough, the brother of that wicked varmint Black Benny. A shrewd opportunist, Guy's done sold all the town land ('ceptin' the outhouses) four times over! Every acre in town that ain't got an outhouse on it is owned by the miners, the railroads, AND the fort captain. Just about a year ago, miners digging in the shadow of Fort Rossdorf struck the mother lode! But it wasn't gold, and it wasn't silver. No, my friend, it was just a little spring. Not any ordinary spring, though! It was a torrent of that mind-marbling drink the locals call &quot;Wacky Water!&quot; &#10;&#10;&#10;Now that water's done what the sun and the wind couldn't do: it's made those landholders brave enough to take matters into their own hands. Now they'll use whatever means they can to bowl over the competition and lay claim to the only fertile spots left in town! Now the only thing stoppin' 'em is the Town Charter Amendment #5, which states: &quot;no landholder may move, remove, or detonate any outhouse without a majority vote of the Town Citizens...&quot; Now one thing's for sure: something's gonna stink in Rossdorf, purty darn soon.....&#10;&#10;&#10;In Wacky Wacky West you and your fellow townfolk place track tiles, street tiles, and river tiles hoping to destroy your rivals' buildings. Every time someone tries to build over a precious outhouse, the town votes! You try to enlist your supporters (represented by cards) to vote with you to stop or encourage the play of certain tiles-perhaps saving some of your buildings or taking out those of your dastardly opponents.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Battle for Germany game is small, it only takes about three to four hours to play for players of normal skill and luck. The game starts in December of 1944 with the Ardennes Offensive (a variant allows the German player to skip this and save his strength). As a two-player game, it is interesting in that each player plays both an Allied army (Western Allies or Soviet Union) AND a German army (Western Front or Eastern Front). This forces each player to play offense and defense. The player playing the Western Allies and Eastern Germans has a very challenging task. The Western Germans have good defensive terrain (the Rhine river and Westwall defenses), while the Eastern Germans have weak units, a long front, very poor defensive terrain and they face a large Soviet and Yugoslav army. The only real advantage enjoyed by the East German player is the lack of victory points to be gained in the East, and the slow Soviet replacement rate. The Western Alllied units are very fast moving, but they don't usually get a chance to exploit this until the very end of the game (at best).&#10;&#10;The map is the same size as most SPI Quadrigames or folio games and has similar graphics. Cities are rated as 1 or 2 victory points, with Berlin worth 10. A line down the middle of Germany cannot be crossed (in the 2-player game), which makes Berlin the only city which can be captured by the Western Allies or the Soviets (ahistorical, but essential to the game's concept). Units are corps for the Germans and Western Allies and corps, armies, or fronts for the Soviet player. Each unit is rated for attack, defense and movement. Combat is decided by an odds-based combat results table and a die roll. Combat results include various combinations of retreat and elimination (there are no step losses, disruption or anything like this). Eliminated units can be replaced, but very slowly and (for some players) with the weakest available unit coming back first.&#10;&#10;The game includes variants for 3- and 4-player versions where the Germans are played by 1 or 2 players, and a &quot;red star/ white star&quot; scenario where the Western Allies and Soviets fight it out with some help from the remnants of the German army.&#10;&#10;Originally published in S&amp;T 50 - May/Jun 1975&#10;&#10;",

The empire is weak, and wild barbarian hordes from the vast eastern steppes surge across the frontier.&#10;&#10;You are the ruler of one of those barbarian hordes, pouring into the rich and decadent West.

With 4 action cards in hand per turn, you have seven turns in which to develop your domains by building various types of military, religious, and civil buildings. Depending on their size, certain buildings are moved in time, which means that they are transferred to the same place on the priories board (Renaissance period) and on the brotherhoods board (modern period), in ruins for military and religious buildings (castles, abbeys&hellip;).&#10;&#10;Thanks to the watch makers' invention, and with enough money, you can make your two adventurer pawns travel in time&hellip; Because if the construction of certain buildings can be profitable, taking over domains on the various boards is essential, since it will allow you to earn bonuses on the 4th and 7th turns and to move ahead of your opponents.&#10;&#10;Playing with time is not without consequences, and it can produce surprising results!

On the priories board, it is the religious control that will be taken into account. On the brotherhoods board, the players who have best populated the civil buildings and restored the ruins will secure the best profits.&#10;&#10;The possibility of destroying and regrouping buildings to unite or divide domains provides a strong and permanent level of interaction between the players.&#10;&#10;",

The game lasts eight rounds, with three cards being dealt to each player in the first round, four cards in the second, five in the third, and so on. Each card has one or two letters on it as well as a point value.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player draws the top card from the deck or discard pile, then discards a card. When a player is able to use all of the cards in his hand (with one left for discarding) to spell words &mdash; each of which must contain at least two cards &mdash; he may go out by placing the words on the table. Each other player takes one final turn, then plays as many cards as they can in words. Each player now scores, adding the point value for cards used in words, then subtracting points for any cards remaining in hand. In addition, the player with the most words and the player with the longest word each receive 10 bonus points; in case of a tie, no one receives the bonus. Whoever has the highest score after eight rounds wins!&#10;&#10;Quiddler also includes rules for a solo variant.&#10;&#10;",

A typical game is best of three or five rounds.&#10;&#10;Pixel Tactics Deluxe is a perfect place to start playing the game.

The cards are numbered 1-100, and each card has a number of bullheads on it. Each player starts with ten cards in hand and is trying to discard those cards to win the round. The player who goes out scores zero points, while everyone else loses points equal to the number of bullheads on their cards.&#10;&#10;Instead of playing cards on multiple rows, however, players play onto a single discard stack, with the played card being higher than the top card of the stack but not more than ten higher; if you can&rsquo;t (or don't want to) play a card within this ten point range, you have to pick up the discard pile. Ergo, &quot;11 takes&quot;. You then start two new stacks by revealing cards from the top of the deck. The number of piles keeps growing throughout the game.&#10;&#10;Each time you take a stack with more than three cards, you get a bull card. With bull cards, you can play additional cards on your turn as long as all the cards fall within that ten point spread. For each bull card you can play on one different stack.&#10;&#10;",

With next to no elements replicated from the base set, Heart of the Mists is the perfect addition to the existing Mistfall set &ndash; and a challenging experience both solitaire, as well as with a group of up to three friends.&#10;&#10;Gather up your resolve, check your gear and get ready to go to the smoldering heart of the unrelenting Mists!&#10;&#10;",
