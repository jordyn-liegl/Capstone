You need to pet one; you all do.&#10;&#10;Luckily, the Hair of the Dog pub will let you in, as long as you&rsquo;re buying drinks. Your group heads there with a singular mission: pet all the dogs.&#10;&#10;Of course, it&rsquo;s not enough just to pet the dogs. You need to win: to be the undisputed best at hand-to-dog contact. To do so, you must get a variety of scratching styles from unique dogs. The dogs at this bar are picky and all have different criteria you must meet before they let you pet them. You also need to be a good patron of the establishment by buying drinks. Failure to be a good customer will result in the staff shaming you for selfishly taking up space.&#10;&#10;Pet the dogs better than your friends and don&rsquo;t be shamed. Should be a relaxing evening, right?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the CPG website&#10;&#10;",

Militia is converted by occupation of a city through advance after combat.&#10;&#10;There are 240 counters, most of which represent combat units of the Russian army and Ministry of the Interior heavy and airborne divisions, along with their elite air assault, special forces and naval infantry brigades, and ad hoc revolutionary militia formations.

Thus, if you have cards showing &quot;2&quot; and &quot;4&quot;, you cannot bid 2, 4, 12, 14, 22, etc. What's more, when someone wins an auction, the money is paid out to those owning a card whose number matches the &quot;ones&quot; digit of the winning bid. Thus, while you need to acquire cards in order to win the game, you don't want to enrich your opponents too much.&#10;&#10;Templari differs from the earlier releases Don and Serengeti in that the game has a maximum count of five players, all players start with twelve coins, and in each round players bid on lots of exactly two cards (whereas in earlier versions, the lots would have one, then two, then three cards, then back to one).&#10;&#10;",

Players are working together to gather clues, kill monsters, close gates and eventually defeat the Great Old One (Cthulhu).&#10;&#10;Players will select characters, each with a unique special ability.  During a player's turn they will roll 5 dice with unique symbols on each side, after rolling they have the option of re-rolling 3 more times.  If the &quot;Monster&quot; symbol is rolled on a die it is locked and cannot be re-rolled.  If 3 Monster symbols appear a new gate opens and a monster appears in Arkham.  The other sides of the dice include movement points, clue tokens (used to close gates), healing, and combat symbols (used when fighting the monsters guarding the gates).  Each player must carefully choose how to use their symbols to move around and try to close and collect six gates.  If six gates are open on the board the players automatically lose..  However if the players manage to close six gates Cthulhu awakens and players must try to defeat him with their remaining items and abilities.&#10;&#10;This game is in no small part inspired by Felbrigg Herriot's (FNH1) wonderful Dune Express game.&#10;&#10;",

Cards are worth various amounts of awesomeness, and you want to be the most awesome hero at the end of the third day.&#10;&#10;Awesome Kingdom: Mines &amp; Labyrinths is both a standalone game and an expansion for Awesome Kingdom: The Tower of Hateskull, with two new dungeons for heroes to explore: Cretin's Labyrinth and the Mines of Murray.&#10;&#10;",

Hurricanes whip down out of nowhere and destroy entire cities while uncontrollable firestorms tear across nearly every continent. Viruses rage out of control. Within this chaos, nefarious factions work from the shadows conducting disinformation campaigns and mobilizing mercenaries to collect a new mysterious energy resource of incalculable power. These factions, led by ruthless warlords, are fighting for power and control, but they are also simply battling for the destiny of humanity. The shadow conflict begins.&#10;&#10;Risk: Shadow Forces is a legacy-style game. You will write on your game, mark it, put stickers on it, and even throw away parts of it. Every game played will change every future game. All players shape how their world evolves: its history, its cities, even its factions and how they fight. Cards and stickers will come into play. Unlock new rules and watch events unfold with each game. No two games will ever be the same.&#10;&#10;More specifically, the game includes four sealed envelopes and one sealed container. You will be directed to open these envelopes as you play your campaign missions in order.&#10;&#10;Warlords have emerged to not only lead the various factions, but to also go on covert missions. Each of these covert missions is a squad-level skirmish game that will have a direct effect on the world map in certain undetermined secret locations.&#10;&#10;",

Scenarios cover the battles of Antietam, South Mountain, and Harper&rsquo;s Ferry. All can be linked to re-create the entire campaign.&#10;Each unit and commander which fought or could have fought in the campaign is rated for its movement, combat and leadership capabilities. The Confederates are vastly outnumbered, but boast fine commanders such as Robert E. Lee, Thomas A. &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson and James Longstreet. The Union Army is fighting on its own ground and is much more powerful than the Confederate forces, but has difficulty bringing that might to bear. If they can, the war might end sooner. If the Confederates succeed, they might swing Maryland to the Southern side.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Scriba is yet another Scrabble clone. Quite popular on Polish market due to much lower price.&#10;&#10;Scriba is an extended version of Scriba Travel, because it provides two variants of gameplay. The first variant is exactly the same, but the second is quite insane.&#10;&#10;The first variant is similar to Scrabble (but there are some differences). Players use their 6/7/8 (this is up to the players) drawn letter-tiles to form words on the gameboard. Each word laid out earns points based on the commonality of the letters used, with certain board spaces giving bonuses. But a word can only be played if it uses at least one already-played tile or adds to an already-played word. The differences between Scriba (1st variant) and Scrabble are:&#10;- If you play all but one letter from your rack you get 20 points bonus.&#10;- You can stack the letters on top of the already played (like in Upwords), but only two levels of letters are allowed&#10;- There are negative bonuses on the board.&#10;- The player that ends the game receive 50 points bonus (because he played all his letters, we don't mind if he had one or two).&#10;- If a player passes, he receives minus 5 points.&#10;- The are tiles with no letter but with a black spot. This can be placed anywhere adjacent to already played tiles and is usually used to prevent from extending a particular word.&#10;- The are tiles with a curved arrow (wich looks like 'enter key') which allows to play a word half vertically and half horizontally.&#10;&#10;The second variant uses every rule from first variant with some additional rules:&#10;- The players use chips in four colors to place all the bonuses on the board wherever they want.&#10;- Whenever a player uses the bonus, he takes the chip from the board and places it in front of him. Every chip is worth 1 point during the final scoring.&#10;- The start player does not have to place his first word in the middle of the board.&#10;- After every move the player roll a d6 and draws that number of letter-tiles.&#10;- There are 12 big yellow chips which at the start of the game are distributed to the players in equal shares. Every chip is worth 10 points at the end of the game. Whenever a player plays exactly four letter-tiles from is rack, he can take one big chip from a chosen opponent.&#10;&#10;",

The game ends after 5 rounds. Each player rolls the unidice during their turn. The top and sides of the digital die turn into their own D6 which means you roll a total of 5 dice in one unidice. The dice results range from numbers to senators and revolt. During their turn, a player can reroll and lock and unlock die faces up to 3 times. Since final dice results can give a senator an advantage, they can choose to aim for a certain dice result to overthrow the other players.&#10;&#10;Caesar is a brand new turn-based game you can play with the unidice - a gaming console in the shape of a die. A player can roll/reroll 3 times until the final result is confirmed. The game proceeds automatically to the next player's turn. Automating the roles with the app and unidice makes reading rules becomes almost redundant as you learn the game on the fly.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

A course constructed in a savage area of turbulent space studded with rotating black holes, fluctuating intense radiation zones, space-time disruption fields and randomly moving hunter-killer mines that will test your piloting skill and courage to the fullest.  Set within this field are a series of Buoys that must be recovered to score victory points.  Some of the Buoys are in fixed positions, others move randomly.  The most valuable of all are the Astaroth, Belial and Lucifer Buoys which are locked in tight orbit in the intense radiation zones surrounding the monstrous Hell2 and Hell3 black holes.  Players must design their ships' maximum function levels in each category of ship operation and must pilot the ship through the treacherous course in the quest of Buoys.  Players must always be aware of the course obstacles, the positions of the other racers, and the remaining fuel supply of their ship.  Demon's Run is a game that is played in a delicate balance between success and disaster.  It is not some simple couple hundred laps around an oval track.  Demon's Run is a wide eyed, full power leap into the mouth of Hell!&#10;&#10;You design your ship before each race by distributing points between Fuel, Structural Integrity, Pilot Integration, Main Engines, Manoeuvre Engines, Tractor (used to recover buoys), Laser (used to attack buoys, mines and other players' ships), Scrambler (used to disorient an opposing player), Screens and Velocity.  Campaign rules are provided so pilots and ships can improve between races.  It is relatively easy to make the game playable by more than four --you need only make up more ship set up sheets and a few counters.&#10;&#10;",

The dice will refer to one of the face-up cards on the table. The first person to slap the correct card takes it, and a new card is turned face-up from the deck to replace it. The dice are then passed to the next player in clockwise order, and the same process is repeated.&#10;&#10;When only two monster cards remain on the table, the game ends. Players count up the monster cards that they have taken, and the player with the most cards wins.

When everyone has chosen which Characters to play, all Character Cards are flipped face-up, and their special abilities are resolved in the order of their respective Activation Numbers (the lowest numbered card is resolved first). After resolving all Character abilities, each player takes back the Character or Characters still in front of them. If at that point any player has 7 or more Booty Cards in front of them, the game ends, and Booty is counted to see who wins.&#10;&#10;",

Like Mousetrap, the gameboard is dominated (in fact, consists of) a large Rube Goldberg-ish contraption.  Players use a plastic &quot;putter&quot; to flick a small (about 1cm in diameter) ball around a nine-hole miniature golf course.  Some holes require the ball to roll into an elevator which carries it up and dumps it into a spiral track leading to the hole.  Others require the ball to be hit up a ramp into a basketball hoop or rebounded off bumpers.  One hole even consists of a dangling plastic chicken that swings back and forth pendulum-style (a little oil might be useful for this one as there's too much friction as-is for the chicken to swing freely.)  Players have three chances to play each hole.  Whoever sinks their putt in the fewest shots is awarded a token--no tokens awarded for ties.  The ninth hole has two holes, one harder to reach than the other.  Players are awarded one token for sinking their putt into the easy hole, or two for the hard one.  The player with the most tokens wins.&#10;&#10;",

Players take the role of heroes that are working together to thwart the evil Foe. On their adventure the heroes will work together in an effort to bolster their party and fend off this powerful enemy. The players will harness mighty abilities and powerful equipment while they work as a team to rid the world of this wretched evil!&#10;&#10;Each round starts with the Foe, who is autonomous. The Foe has a set action it takes each turn, and then plays cards from its deck. The cards in the Foe deck include Vassals under its employ that also fight the Heroes, as well as powerful abilities that the Foe will use to damage and weaken the Heroes. At the end of the Foe phase, the party of Heroes may collectively choose a card in the city to refresh, making other options available for the next turn.&#10;&#10;After the Foe phase is complete, the party of Heroes begin their turns. Turn order starts with whoever the party selects. Each Hero turn plays out very simply, they can play a card from their hand, buy a card from the city (using their experience), and use one of their heroic Feats. Each Hero has a completely unique starting deck and plays totally different from each other Hero!&#10;&#10;Play continues until the Foe is defeated or the party is destroyed, whichever happens first. In Foe Hunters, players don't use cards to buy cards like most deck building games. Each Hero has their own experience pool that they draw upon to purchase cards, and when these cards are purchased they go directly to hand instead of to your discard pile. This allows you to get answers for problems when you need them.&#10;&#10;The deck building element in Foe Hunters revolves around the City Deck. This deck has several cards that are available for purchase. Many of these cards have a class affinity, which allows the Hero that matches the class to purchase the card for a discount.&#10;&#10;Foe Hunters is a new take on co-op that mixes a lightweight system with the complexity of an in-depth deck building game or card game!&#10;&#10;",

In order to play warriors and perform certain other card effects, you will need to acquire and spend Destiny Points, the &quot;currency&quot; used in DOOMTROOPER (referred to on many cards as D). Warriors earn Promotion Points (referred to on many cards as P) for you by winning battles and through other exciting combinations of card play.&#10;When either player reaches a predetermined number of Promotion Points (normally 25), the game is over. The points are received by killing warriors, completing missions or via special card play.&#10;&#10;Online Play&#10;&#10;&#10;     http://www.lackeyccg.com/downloads.html&#10;&#10;&#10;",

One side has the action/event and the other side can be played for points.  Most cards are worth 4 points, although there are also the 0 point cards, and the 10 point cards.  EVERY card was designed to be OVERLY powerful, which then re-balanced into them all being even, but still every turn a massive shift can happen.&#10;     The object of the game is to get the most points, but in Skittykitts even this can change.
