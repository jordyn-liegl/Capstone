To get around this &ldquo;Operation PARTY&rdquo; is born. The quietest kong of each night will get bananas as a reward. But the noisiest kong will get a banana peel in the face instead. At the end of the third night, the party must end because by then KONGKANG will be wide awake. You must hoard as much banana as possible before KONGKANG wakes up. The kong that collects the most bananas wins.&#10;&#10;Kongkang: the wild party is a party card game based on a traditional card game from Southern Thailand called &quot;Kang&quot;. Players try to get rid of high cards and keep the low one.  But that is not all, you can steal banana tokens from you another player via in-game Flow mechanic. Or use ability card to hinder other players. The player who has the lowest hand when the round end, wins banana tokens. After three rounds, the player with the most banana tokens wins the game!&#10;&#10;",

In the Arrivals phase, players draft tourists to visit their stations, with the players whose attractions and amenities most align with current trends getting to pick first (which usually means they will also get extra tourists, as arrival numbers are rarely an exact multiple of the player count!) If a player does not have a suitable spot for the type of tourist they wish to draft, the tourist is ejected into space, negatively affecting your station&rsquo;s ratings!&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, the winner is the player with the most QUID &ndash; or Quantum Universal Intergalactic Denomination, the accepted currency of all space resorts.

The aim is to make a line of 4 of the same symbol, but as you and your opponent are in control of the same stones and with them constantly being flipped over to reveal new symbols, it&rsquo;s not as simple as it sounds.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

But some of us are still here, doing our best to press on. Spending most days just trying to put food in our mouths... Trying to make the best of this hell on earth. It wouldn't be quite so bad, if not for those damned raiders. Scumbags come in and try to take what isn't theirs.

However, they also must work together against a common enemy, the Raiders! The key is to send the right amount of troops out to protect the region, while also keeping a few at home to developed their skills for future rounds.&#10;&#10;SoS uses simultaneous play and an average game takes about 45 minutes or less to play.

    "description": "Retail and individual orders available at PlayChinookGames@gmail.com&#10;Game includes English, German, French and Dutch components.&#10;&#10;Thematic Overview:&#10;&#10;The Realm of Kanta is reopening borders after a mysterious calamity struck the land. Clans now compete to rebuild their wealth by claiming the lands they lost.&#10;&#10;The new economy revolves around small chains of allied states. Each clan sends its own envoys to claim states, opening borders in the process. Once a ring of six states share open borders, wealth comes to participating clans. Neighboring allies also help one another to suppress uprisings started by competing clans.&#10;&#10;How to Play (2-6 Player Version):&#10;Each player selects one of eight role cards that identifies their clan and its unique strengths. Your goal is to finish the game as the wealthiest in this new era. The game is played on a board showing a bird's eye view of the realm of Kanta, overlaid by a hexagonal grid representing the realm's states.&#10;&#10;Every player gets the same number of hexagon tiles to start (anywhere from 8-20 depending on the number of players and the desired game length). Each of these &quot;council tiles&quot; identifies your clan and represents a group of six of its members. As leader, you send these councils out to reclaim states by placing one tile per turn.&#10;&#10;A council tile must be placed next to Kanta City (start location) or another claimed state. That's because councils are dispatched from Kanta City, and can only travel across open borders. When you place a tile, you are opening any borders that the state shares with occupied adjacent states.&#10;&#10;How exactly are those borders opened? Your council members are assigned one to each edge of the tile. They each speak one of three languages of the realm, which is indicated by one of three colors on each tile edge. Your council must speak a common language at every shared border where you place the tile.&#10;&#10;Players earn wealth by positioning themselves to be part of rings of claimed states. Each ring of six claimed states earns gold for the involved clans, proportionate to the amount of representation a clan has in each ring. Each additional state that one clan has in a given ring earns less than the previous state.&#10;&#10;Players also gain wealth and abilities through action cards. Earn cards by claiming several states that produce the same type of resource (e.g. 3 wood-producing states). The action cards are highly integrated thematically, yet are not so complicated as to slow game play. Your progress earning action cards is recorded using a track at the bottom of the board.&#10;&#10;Perils and opportunities abound, including states still dealing with the plague, and mysterious island states.&#10;&#10;The game ends when everyone has placed all of their tiles. The player with the most wealth (consisting of coins and coin value of action cards in hand) wins.&#10;&#10;How to Play (1 Player Version):&#10;The solo play option is an exciting 20-minute game that flips the game mechanics on their head! It also serves as a thematic prequel to what happens in 2-6 player games. Play as either the Mountain Clan or Water Clan as you escort your allies, the threatened Valley Clan, to the safety of Kanta City. New challenges and thrills await, using the same base components of the regular game.&#10;&#10;Use the 3 resource tracker tokens from the regular game to represent you and your family, scattered in the realm. Use your 20 council tiles from the regular game as movement tokens, spending them to pass through deserts, forests, plains and more at your peril to locate the Valley Clan leader and her family. Then bring your family and hers to the safety of Kanta City. Be prepared with action cards as you encounter the Desert and Forest Clans, plagued states and more.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "ENTER A WORLD OF VICTORIAN HORROR!&#10;&#10;In 19th-century Rome, ancient crypts have been discovered beneath the Capuchin tombs. Take on the role of a dauntless explorer and plunder these catacombs of their secrets and spoils. Build your catacomb as you go, seeking finds and surviving horrors. End your story before the evils of the catacomb devour you all!&#10;&#10;IN TENEBRIS LUX is a game for 1-4 players ages 13 and up, and can be played in about 45 minutes to an hour. &#10;Players rush to explore and resolve personal quests, called narratives, before their opponents can resolve their own, or the dark catacombs close in on them, ending the game.&#10;&#10;The game is played in turns, each broken into 3 Steps, with several Phases.&#10;&#10;STEP 1: BREATHE The first Step adds Rooms to the Catacombs, by drawing them from a random pile. This builds up the game board out of playing card sized map pieces, or Rooms. This step also has a phase allowing Explorers to change their gear, referred to as Equipment or Finds&hellip; this is critical as these important items strengthen an Explorer so that they may deal with the dangers to come. Following phases allow an Explorer to adjust their card hand and play any non-room cards, if so desired.&#10;&#10;STEP 2: SEEK The second step allows Explorers to actually explore and navigate through the Catacombs, or growing game board.  This dangerous course allows Explorers to search for new Finds and gear. More phases allow for adding extra Rooms, or cards, onto the board, moving around from card to card, and interacting with Room Cards in order to complete Naratives, or the game&rsquo;s objectives. This is the Phase where Explorers are most at risk of stumbling upon Horrors, as they are actively exploring the Catacombs.&#10;&#10;STEP 3: SURVIVE In Step 3 Horrors, the game&rsquo;s many monsters in the dark, may attack your Explorer! Canny and brave Explorers may also strike out and attack each other in hopes of thwarting each other&rsquo;s progress in pursuit of personal Narratives. This phase resolves each combat one by one, and adjusts health and loot bodies.&#10;&#10;Basic combat is simple. As the attacker, role one of the game&rsquo;s 14 included dice, and add it to your chosen Trait (Grit, Wit or Daring).  The Defender rolls one die and adds it to their same Trait, as they defend along the same lines as the incoming attack. Whichever result is highest wins.&#10;&#10;The game&rsquo;s &ldquo;Combat Reference Card&rdquo; will take players through any extra steps, notably the way in which rooms impact the outcomes with rolls in combat. Each Horror and Explorer features an affinity with different Room types, this gives an edge or disadvantage in combat. Be careful of the Room you land on, it will have dire consequences!&#10;&#10;After each Step is resolved a player finishes their turn and, moving clockwise, the next player goes, and so on. The game is ended when one player completes their randomly drawn Narrative objective, all Explorers are killed, or the Doom Counter (the Game&rsquo;s timer) has run its course, sending the catacombs crashing in on the hapless Explorers.&#10;&#10;In Tenebris Lux comes with 13 Jumbo Explorer cards, 4 jumbo Combat and Turn Cycle reference cards, a full color rule book, 24 Horror cards, 18 Equipment cards, 21 Find cards, 12 Narrative cards, 32 Room cards, 3 Great Room Jumbo cards, one Jumbo Doom Counter card, 14 Dice, 13 Double Sided Explorer counters with 4 stands, and a counter for each Horror as well as many counters to help record progress for Narratives.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "(From the Publisher)&#10;The Battlelines&trade; series of card games allow players to recreate the epic struggles of World War II. Each player uses a deck of cards to represent the troops of an historical formation about the size of a division. A third deck, the Operation deck, is used to create a series of battles using Mission and Location cards. Points are scored for achieving Mission objectives and destroying enemy troops. A typical 100 point Operation can be played in about an hour.  The game can also be played by teams of up to three players on each side.&#10;&#10;This, the first  in the Battlelines&trade; Series World War II card games. It includes Units and Operations from the German 1942 offensive against Stalingrad, the Soviet counter-attack (Operation Uranus) which trapped the German 6th Army in the city, and the gallant efforts of 4th Panzer Army to relieve their surrounded comrades (Operation Winter Storm).&#10;&#10;Unit Decks represent divisional level assets. They are the basic play decks. One is needed for each player. Operation Decks are used to generate a &quot;random&quot; series of &quot;scenarios&quot; depicting several days of fighting. Higher Echelon Decks will allow players to introduce new cards into their Unit Decks to liven up the game and surprise their opponents with new stratagems.&#10;&#10;The decks are not &quot;collectible&quot; per se.  There are no &quot;rare&quot; cards to collect.  They can however be customized by mixing in units from &quot;higher echelon&quot; decks that are available.  The game is considered &quot;expandable&quot; since there are many different decks (sold individually) that can be played against each other.&#10;&#10;",

The board represents the machine which distributes newly-minted marbles from the center and funnels them to one of six goal areas at the edge of the board.  The winning player is the one who can manipulate the process to get the most marbles by the end of the day.&quot;&#10;&#10;Players manipulate the process by playing Machine Tiles: Machine Parts &amp; Modifiers, or Marbles during their turns. Machine Parts alter the direction or behavior of Marble Tiles that move over them on a turn. Some Machine Part Tiles reverse direction, redirect, push or jump the Marble.&#10;Modifier Tiles allow players to reposition or remove previously played Machine Part Tiles.&#10;&#10;Marble Tiles are printed with a directional arrow and a value from 1 to 4. The player positions the arrow in a direction of his choosing in the center of the board. When subsequent marbles are placed, all marbles currently on the board will move in the direction of their arrow the distance identified by their printed value.&#10;&#10;Players must play at least one, and at most two, tiles per turn. If a player plays a marble on her first turn, she immediately takes a second turn, playing another marble or a Machine Tile (A machine Part of Modifier).&#10;&#10;The game ends when there are no tiles left for a player to draw or a player has met the specified marble quota for the game. This triggers the final phase, in which the machine keeps running until all of the marbles on the board reach their final destination. After the final phase, the player with the most marbles wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Towers of the Sun is an abstract strategy game in which two to four players take on the role of mystical clans each coming from their own unique and beautiful regions. They&rsquo;ve lived in peace and harmony until a dangerous and mysterious mist begins to gradually cover their world, blocking out the sunlight. The clans must now compete to collect the remaining sunlight, and build majestic towers to escape the mist and reach towards the sun.&#10;&#10;During the game players will build and navigate a changing, three-dimensional landscape. The playing field is limited and players will compete for the best positions, occasionally battling it out with their hand cards in a simple, yet mind-boggling duel of simultaneous reveal. As they navigate the board, players will collect sun crystals that other players have dropped. At the end of each round the sun shines upon a different tower presenting the players with additional sun crystals. Before a new round begins, players will score points based on which tower they stand upon and the crystals they&rsquo;ve collected so far.&#10;&#10;The main mechanisms used in the game are its modular board (mutated by the players via tile placement), area control, hand management and deductive logic (for the card battles). Beyond the strategy of building and managing their tower tiles, players must also think ahead and not be too greedy because after the scoring phase of each round the leading player will have to exercise their generosity and care by providing charity to the lowest scoring player. This adds both rubber-banding and interactivity that makes every game tense until the last sun crystal has been claimed.&#10;&#10;The game comes to end when all of the sunlight is gone. This happens naturally, with sun crystals being collected each round, but players can also force this to happen early by standing atop a tower of 8 tiles or more and essentially &ldquo;reaching the sun&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "The French town of Loos (L&#197;&#141;s) was the British contribution to a massive Allied offensive on the Western Front in the Fall of 1915. Masterminded by the French General-in-Chief Joffre, the offensive was intended both to draw German strength away from the reeling Russians and to pinch out the German salient (&ldquo;the Noyon Bulge&rdquo;) aimed at Paris. Launched with limited artillery support and using several raw New Army divisions, the ostensible aim of the British attack was to seize the German rail lines behind the front, but in reality was a diversion for the main French offensive in Champagne. The British player, with a massive numerical superiority and heavy artillery support, must progress quickly. Powerful German reserves are nearby,and the battle becomes a race between the British advance and the German reaction.&#10;&#10;Loos uses a modification of the popular Fire &amp; Movement game system. Developed to portray the mechanized battlefields of a later generation, F&amp;M stresses the use of fire support to generate breakthroughs, followed by a rapid penetration by mobile reserves. At Loos, no one moved faster than a man on foot, and fire support was clumsy, unreliable, and inflexible. Thus the strength of that support is variable and serves as a precursor to combat rather than an enhancement of it. Exploitation is made only by units set aside for the purpose; they must be deployed behind (under) fighting units, and their subsequent movement is randomized.&#10;&#10;The fighting is attritional. The only way to avoid a stalemate is to mass troops and hammer away at an enemy sector until it breaks. Neither side has the forces to attack all along the line, so the location and direction of the attacks must be selected carefully. The player who makes the better choices will emerge the victor.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Red Tide South is a two-player game. It is a stand-alone game that can is also designed to be played with Red Tide West (Modern War #15). A war in Europe during the 1980&rsquo;s was primarily going to be decided, one way or the other, in West Germany. Other fronts and theaters were therefore almost irrelevant in the short term. Considering the Soviets&rsquo; exceedingly optimistic timetables by which they intended to overrun West Germany, events elsewhere would have not even played out before the war ended (either by mutual annihilation or by rapprochement). However, the Balkan Front could have had the most direct influence on the campaign in West Germany. If there was no significant nuclear exchange in Central Europe, a Soviet capture of the heavily industrialized Po Valley would potentially compel the Italians to sue for peace, as well as serve as a gateway to Southern France. Each hex is equivalent to about 10 miles (16 kilometers) from side to opposite side, and each turn represents about a day.&#10;&#10;Components: One 22&quot; x 34&quot; map &amp; 228 counters (plus 46 bonus counters for Red Tide West)&#10;&#10;Magazine: Strategy &amp; Tactics #315&#10;&#10;",

There are also Special Effects cards that can be played to perform special actions such as killing off particular character types or modifying an attack.  The goal of the game is to have the most points in your movie when the &quot;Roll the Credits&quot; card is played or the draw deck runs out of cards.&#10;&#10;The addition of Treasure props sets this game apart from other B-Movie Series games, as they provide an additional requirement to win the game.&#10;&#10;This is a stand-alone entry to the series, but may also be mixed with other B-Movie Series games.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "The rabbits of Wiggins Farm have gotten out of control. While Farmer Wiggins was away on vacation, the rabbits got into the house where they kept the sports equipment, the art supplies, the cosplay costumes and the box of classic movies. The farmer arrived home to find the place overrun with all kinds of rabbits. He&rsquo;s calling upon you, the luckiest person he knows, for help to get these rabbits back into their rabbit hole where they belong. It&rsquo;s a big job. There are a LOT of rabbits to round up. Maybe even one too many---but if you hop to it, you can save the day.&#10;&#10;One Two Many Rabbits is a fun, fast-paced, family friendly card and dice game that is easy to learn and takes about 10 to 20 minutes to play. The main rules are for 2-4 players, but also included are rules for a one player game so that people can try their hand at some solo play.&#10;&#10;Each player starts off with a LOT of rabbits and will choose to roll one, two or three dice in order to create the numbers that will help them decide which rabbits will willingly go back into the rabbit hole. But, watch out, these rabbits are tricky and will use the turns of the people playing against you to find ways to hop back into your hands. As play continues and the number of rabbits in your hand start to dwindle, the more difficult it will be to roll the numbers that you need to get rid of all of your rabbits.&#10;&#10;There are also special cards in the deck to help you along. Wild cards can be used as any number. Plus Minus cards can be used to add or subtract two of your number cards together. Piggyback cards allow you to use the roll of your opponent to get rid of some rabbits. And Place Your Rab-Bets cards allow you to take a wild guess on which number will be rolled next and try to get rid of some rabbits that way.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Road to Enlightenment gives players control of great scientists, artists, philosophers, religious leaders, politicians, and military leaders, bringing them uniquely and individually to life. You play as one of the great monarchs from 17th and early 18th century Europe representing one of the seven top powers of the era: Austria, England, France, Poland, Russia, Spain, or Sweden. Your objective is to be recognized as the most prestigious monarch by producing the most admired art and culture, lead the continent in scientific innovations, spread or resist the spread of Catholicism, and attempt military expansion beyond your historical borders. All of this is accomplished by marshaling 134 historical &quot;luminaries&quot; &ndash; important historical figures covering every relevant domain of human achievement during the period.&#10;&#10;The luminaries are rated in between one and seven different areas of endeavour: military, politics, religion, ideas, science, art, or wealth. Additionally, each luminary has a unique Action, Enhancement, or Response based on their real historical achievements to be brought to bear in service of your nation.&#10;&#10;Consider the difference between Rembrandt and Vermeer: Both are important and wonderful artists, but in the real-life Dutch Republic, Rembrandt was famous and well-patronized, composing hundreds of celebrated portraits in his career. Vermeer was obscure and produced an order of magnitude less art in his career. In Road to Enlightenment, Rembrandt has higher ratings and gives you a benefit every single time another luminary is removed from the game, reflecting the influence and nature of his portraiture. On the other hand, Vermeer provides only a modest benefit to reflect the limited impact his career had at the time.&#10;&#10;Invading other countries in the 17th century was a complex mix of cultural, religious, and logistical considerations. These have all been baked into the various territories on the map, making it quick and easy to make decisions around where to try to attack:&#10;&#10;&#10;     You can attempt to invade only those territories that have your nation's colour on the top of the circle. Those are the only nations that could have even possibly successfully invaded that territory in real-life.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     The number associated with each nation's colour indicates how difficult it would be to successfully conquer. In the case of London, it is very difficult for Spain, France, or Sweden to conquer it.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     The religious symbol in the lower left corner lets the player know whether the territory is primarily Catholic, primarily Anti-Catholic (Protestant, Russian Orthodox, and other Christian branches), or primarily Islamic. If it is successfully invaded by a nation with a different religious affiliation, it has an impact on the continental struggle between religions.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     The lines connecting into London, and the anchor with an &quot;A&quot; in the lower right corner, indicate which territories need to be held by a player before they have access to attack. The anchor with an &quot;A&quot; indicates that any player who already owns another Atlantic port territory is connected and could choose to attack over the water.&#10;&#10;&#10;With Road to Enlightenment, all of the intricacies related to managing military expansion have been baked into these easy-to-use board mechanisms.&#10;&#10;In order to create a game that simulates the battle between nations for prestige &ndash; covering war, politics, religion, science, and art &ndash; while focusing on many of the diverse people of history, we've mashed up aspects from wargames, Euro games, deck-building games, and statistical sports simulations. While it is an eclectic mix, this broad spectrum approach to the game's design enabled this diverse and richly detailed set of conditions to come together in a game that is epic in scale but doesn't take all day to play.&#10;&#10;The full game is for 3-7 players; the pocket version is for 2-4.&#10;&#10;",

Players race against each other over eight rounds to solve little tile-placement problems.   In every round, the first person to solve their puzzle yells &quot;Ubongo!&quot; then counts to some mutually-agreed number of seconds (the rules suggest 20 or 30; but allow that other variations are possible).  All players that complete their puzzle before time runs out keep the puzzle tile (a Pok&eacute;mon ball!) as a scoring reminder, and those that fail give their tile to the first solver.&#10;&#10;So far, that sounds a lot like Ubongo Mini.  (That has a &quot;Don't bother counting; first to solve keeps their tile, and everyone else just stops.&quot; alternate rule, too; and while that rule could easily be used in this version, it's not mentioned.)&#10;&#10;But: the puzzles in &#227;&#130;&#166;&#227;&#131;&#156;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#180; &#227;&#131;&#157;&#227;&#130;&#177;&#227;&#131;&#162;&#227;&#131;&#179; are notably harder.  Each puzzle tile has two sides: one that can be completed with three pieces, and one that requires four.  More, the puzzles don't disclose which pieces are required!  Players have eight possible tiles, and need to figure out which subset works.  (In contrast, Ubongo Mini's puzzles are two or three pre-specified pieces.)&#10;&#10;Additionally, the rules specify that it's possible to complete all puzzles without the simplest (1x3 rectangle) piece.  And that using that piece or not could be an additional scaling factor.&#10;&#10;",

Each Armati army can be assembled in three sizes, so that players may build them to suit both their financial resources and desired &quot;look.&quot; 130 armies are included, divided into six periods, thereby permitting a greater array of &quot;eligible&quot; opponents within each period. the game is mechanically simple - a battle can be fought in less than two hours even when using the advanced rules.&#10;&#10;Armati emphasizes careful battle-planning and execution on the part of the player-general, as modified by the particular army system the general commands. Armati stresses the tactical generalities inherent in warfare rather than the exceptional battlefield occurrences in particular battles. To reduce the advantages of a player's &quot;helicopter view&quot; and to provide a more believable simulation of ancient warfare, Armati does not permit the free-wheeling unit maneuvers common to other rules sets. Unit movement is controlled, especially when in close proximity to the enemy. the General's plan of battle is critical to success because it cannot be altered from moment to moment.&#10;&#10;Armati represents soldier types based on their tactical usage rather than their weapons and armor, although equipment contributes to a unit's fighting efficiency.

    "description": "Fanatically popular 32-card trick taking card game played, with special deck, in the Quebec region of Bellchasse (St-Anselme). It was first published as a World War 1 propaganda game in November 1914 by the Tribune newspaper in Sherbrooke, Qc, and was then sold as &quot;Shoo le Kaiser&quot;. It was renamed Joffre, after the victorious French general, in the 1920s. It is a re-emplementation of Lost Heir and was re-emplemented in Saskatchewan as Kaiser.&#10;&#10;It is played with 2 teams of 2. Players bid on the number of tricks they think they will win. High card taking the trick, and each trick being worth 1 point.&#10;&#10;Each suit represents a different army from WWI (ex: instead of an Ace of Hearts you have a 7 General of Russia)&#10;&#10;There are 4 special cards in the deck. If you win a trick with the &quot;Joffre&quot; (French commander in WWI) then he is worth an additional 5 points and taking the German &quot;Kaiser&quot; will cause you to lose 3 points. The other 2 special cards (England and Russia) have no value.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "In a place where politics, magic and science are covered in a heavy layer of coal dust lies the world of Steam Court. Steam Court is a 1&ndash;12 player card game that mixes elements of traditional trick-taking, with character based abilities and victory point win conditions.&#10;&#10;Steam Court is a game of Victorian hierarchy where the more powerful your position, the greater your opportunity in the game. You'll want to try and hold onto the throne, but don't play your cards right and you'll end up serving the lousy Tea Boy. Each round, players rotate position at the table, and depending on their seat they gain/lose privileges. Even though the game is stacked in favor of those at the top, the luck of the deal, use of special cards, and player strategy are guaranteed to make it interesting.&#10;  &#10;There are multiple variations on how to play, but the typical game involves four rounds of cards and usually takes around 60 minutes.&#10; The original artwork, intriguing theme, and clever game play will have you ratcheting for the top in Steam Court.&#10;&#10;Goal: get rid of the cards in your hand before other players do. There are many strategies you can employ do this, but the most common is to be the controlling player to start the trick. The player who wins the trick starts the next trick. This allows you to decide how many cards of the same number you will play. Then all other players must match the quantity of cards played and also beat the number that is on the cards. For example, if a player lays three 1s, then the next player must lay three cards of a higher number - like three 2s or three 3s. What gives this game an extra dimension are the variable character privileges. Each Engineer is granted a different privilege by their Courtier that can be employed at the beginning of the Quarter or throughout the game. For example, the Duke can lay matching numbered cards instead of having to play higher numbered cards on a set of cards.&#10;&#10;End of the Quarter: After everyone's cards have been played the Quarter ends and players re-seat based on the order they went out in (first player out becomes the Queen, and so on). They then gain the privileges of a different character for the next Quarter.&#10;&#10;7-12 players: When playing with a large group a new element is added to the game -- a second table full of Renegades. Players who do poorly in the Royal Court are banished to the Renegade table, while the top two engineers at the Renegade Table are promoted to the Royal Court. In Steam Court, anything can happen. The lowest of low can climb to the top, or the Queen&rsquo;s engineer can wind up working for the vagabond.&#10;&#10;",

Man-Eating House is a trick taking game for 3-4 players with a theme of haunted house.&#10;&#10;This game uses a deck of 44 cards, which consists of three suits (Green, Yellow, Red), and 14 ranks (1-14), plus Green 0 (Dog) and Red 15 (Old Man). Cards ranked 1-3 (with a child figure on the card), ranked 12-14 (ghost figure on the card), Dog, and Old Man are honor cards. You score points by taking these cards.&#10;&#10;Each round, players play a card under trick-taking rules (must follow suit, no trumps). Basically, the player who played the highest rank, regardless of which suit, wins the trick. But there are several exceptions. One example is that if you and other player play a child of the same suit, both of you take that child card and score one point, instead of being taken by the winner of the trick.&#10;&#10;In a four-player game, you win the game with your partner if your team takes honor cards more than your opponent team.&#10;&#10;In a three-player game, the player who played Old Man (Red 15) competes against the other two. The Old Man wins if he captures three children of different rank or he takes 11 honor cards. Otherwise the other two players win the game.&#10;&#10;Publisher's

When Batman and a villain occupy the same space on the board, epic battles ensue as Batman utilizes his Utility Belt and Combat cards and risks retaliation from each villain. The player controlling the Arkham inmates earns victory points by helping the villains escape Arkham, while the Batman player gains points by apprehending his rivals before they make it out of the city, as well as by saving iconic allies by utilizing special gadgets from his utility belt. The first player to earn ten victory points wins!&#10;&#10;The challenge of this game is winning as Batman. You must use cunning, strategy, and excellent timing to win. If you are having trouble winning as Batman, we suggest you use a house rule that allows Batman to draw 2 Combat Cards at the end of his turn, instead of just 1.

    "description": "Component Game Systems came out with a number of component game systems that used the same sort-of-collectible approach (a roughly similar game is Space Race). Besides Babylon 5, there was Hercules, Xena, and Star Trek. The Babylon 5 game was apparently derived from the unpublished Galactic Empires board game, based on the CCG of the same name --Companion Games (Galactic Empires' publisher) became Component Game Systems in the process.&#10;&#10;The basic idea is that each player need only buy his part of the game, representing in this case a specific political entity from the Babylon 5 universe. Players sit down at the same table and put their components in common to have a game. Pretty cool.&#10;&#10;In the Babylon 5 game, you take control of a certain faction which is trying to gain power in the galaxy. You play the role of an ambassador on board Babylon 5. You explore the vast stretches of space, lead huge fleets into battle, and control the economy of your faction. There are several ways to achieve victory ranging from economic growth to all out militaristic control of the universe. Diplomacy is not to be neglected either, as the more powerful game changes are brought up in Babylon 5 council vote to be decided.&#10;&#10;You construct your playing 'board' using hexagonal shaped pieces that come with the game. The various pieces are &#10;different and can represent a multitude of things so that the game is different every time you play. In addition to the board and the ships that move on it, there are cards. Players may buy cards allowing special actions above and beyond the normal game, like an extra move or more EPs. You can create decks for each player as per CCGs, or you can just draw from a common deck after handing out the empire specific cards.&#10;&#10;Using your faction's wealth and resources you play the game and explore the map. You search for planets to colonize and possibly conquer. Use your fleets to engage in battles and use characters to assist you in reaching your faction's goals. The choices are yours and will decide if your faction is successful.&#10;&#10;The game does a very good job of recreating the B5 universe, with play action matching pretty closely the series' happenings. In terms of mechanics, it is similar to Twilight Imperium and Les Cochons de l'espace.&#10;&#10;There are two core sets, although CGS initially intended five (one for each of the show's seasons). They are the 2258 and 2259 Core Sets. The first was published in two formats, the 1997 first printing (Limited Edition; CB5-101) using a smaller, unimpressive box (they were in a hurry to get it to the store shelves by Christmas of that year), whilst the 1998 second printing (CB5-001) came in a beautiful large box (allowing room for the storage of extra sets) labeled as &quot;Babylon 5: The Board Game&quot;. The 2259 Core Set (CB5-102) was only published in the big box format. The core sets include the Earth Alliance, Narn Regime, Centauri Republic and Minbari factions, which were each available separately (although the core sets include some extra cards and stuff beyond the combination of the four individual Starter Kits). There is supposedly enough difference between the 2258 and 2259 core sets to warrant buying both, although I haven't received my 2259 set yet so I can't be sure.&#10;&#10;Component Game Systems has now disappeared from the face of the earth, and even their domain name (www.c-g-s.com) has been recycled by some unrelated outfit.&#10;&#10;Part of the Component Game System.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Forceball is a fast and futuristic sport card game for 2 players. Each match consists of three periods. A period starts with a face-off to decide who's the attacker and who's the defender, and then progresses with the players taking turns either attacking or defending. The period ends when all cards in the deck have been used, and the deck is then reshuffled for the next period.&#10;&#10;During a period the attacker uses his attack maneuvers &ndash; Pass, Dribble or Shot &ndash; to try to score a goal. The defender uses his defense maneuvers &ndash; Block, Tackle or Interception &ndash; to try to prevent a goal. If the attacker scores a goal or the defender intercepts the ball, the roles are reversed and the game continues.&#10;&#10;In addition to the regular attack and defense maneuvers, the players can use special maneuvers to score a lucky shot or intercept the ball using the goalie. It's also possible to foul by making illegal maneuvers, but beware &ndash; you don't want the referee to see you.&#10;&#10;Forceball consists of 56 cards and is a complete game in itself, not a trading card game. The game is easy to learn, easy to carry around in your pocket, and a period takes less than 15 minutes. It's suitable both as a filler and for lengthy tournaments.&#10;&#10;",
