    "description": "In ONDA, players use cards from their hands to compose wave formations superior to those of their opponents according to the current tide. Your goal is to be the first to play all your cards; failing that, try to have as few cards as possible since you lose points based on what's left in your hand.&#10;&#10;In more detail, at the start of play the tide is coming in, that is, high numbers are better than low. In each round, each player starts with a hand of cards, placing two cards face down in front of them; these cards are now wild and still considered part of their hand. To start the trick, the lead player plays a formation consisting of a single card, 2-4 cards of the same value, or a sequence of 2-4 cards. Subsequent players can (1) play a better formation &mdash; &quot;better&quot; being determined by the tide &mdash; (2) pass and be out of the trick, (3) turn the tide by returning one of their face-down cards to their hand, flipping the tide card (so now low numbers are better than high, or vice versa), then playing a better combination, or (4) play a bomb.&#10;&#10;Six types of bombs exist in ONDA, and the current bomb type is shown on top of the bomb deck. A bomb, e.g., a two-card sequence in the same suit, supersedes the current formation, and once played players must beat this formation instead of the previous one. At most one bomb can be played in a trick, and only one player can turn the tide.&#10;&#10;Once all but one player have passed in a trick, clear all played cards and move the top bomb card to the bottom of that deck. Whoever last played leads a new formation. Once a player has no cards in hand &mdash; regardless of face-down cards on the table &mdash; the round ends, and everyone but that player loses points based on their unplayed cards.&#10;&#10;After four rounds, whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

Door cards, trap cards, search cards, corpse cards and chest cards have been rationalized; all is now contained on the room tiles. Undefeated monsters and certain traps now stay on the board, and the game features a slightly more complex and tactical fighting system.

    "description": "Fabula (previously known as Grimm) is a story-telling game where players must fill in parts of a story. One of them is the teller, who read (or imagine) the beginning of a short tale &mdash; his/her current draft. Each other player incarnates a tentative hero (a gnome, a princess, a little boy, etc.) who tries to be the main character of the teller's tale. 3 times during the game, the teller asks the other players how they think things happened at that time of the story. They must choose an item depicted on one of the cards laying at the center of the table and use it to continue the story. Depending on how convincing they are to the teller, and how well they integrated their character and the item to the current twist, they get points in the shape of &quot;quill&quot; markers. Each item can only be used once by any player, who keeps it afterwards, and who puts his/her markers on top of the card.&#10;&#10;At the end of the three turns, the two players with the most quill markers are selected to compete in the epilogue. The teller reads (or makes up) an idea of an ending to the story. Now, each finalist in turn has 30 seconds to present a relevant proposal for including his character and both items figured on the two remaining cards on the table into the ending. (A sand timer is included.) Both players have to use the same two objects, but the second one speaking cannot use them in the same way than the first (more or less compensating the fact he had more time to prepare his part).&#10;&#10;Eventually, the teller decides which of the two finalists wins, depending on the relevance of their proposals.&#10;&#10;The game comes with two proposed variants :&#10;- &quot;Experienced players&quot; : all the players tell the same tale, each one adding an element to the same storyline and bound to continue using the plot of the former speakers.&#10;- &quot;Collective&quot; : there are no quill markers and appraisal given by the teller. Every player takes part in the epilogue, and there's no winner.&#10;&#10;",

Pee Wee mode (15 min): simple, accessible for all, perfect to discover the game, it will easily attract beginners as well as young players. Expert mode (60 min): strategically rich and with great replay value, it will satisfy experienced players.&#10;&#10;The aim is to play a football match and to win the game, by scoring at least one more goal than your opponent. Each player builds its own team during the transfer window using a drafting mechanism.&#10;During the pre-game, each player chooses the lineup of its team (the team's layout on the field) and makes, at the same time, tactical choices to decide how the team will play. In order to do so, each player builds a deck with 14 cards selected among the 42 cards available (such as, for example, 4 tackles, 2 counter-attacks, etc.).&#10;The match is divided into two halves. A half consists of 5 rounds. Each round takes several steps: &#10;- draw, &#10;- substitutions, &#10;- ball possession (each team plays cards alternatively to recover the ball),&#10;- offensive (the team that possesses the ball tries to score a goal), &#10;The first half ends when the players can no longer draw cards. Each player then builds a new 14-card deck to start the second half.&#10;The game ends when the second half is over. The team that scored the most goals wins. A match can also ends up in a draw, a tie between the two players. In such a case and in order to determinate a winner, the players can agree to continue the game by going into extra time and, if necessary, a penalty shoot-out.&#10;Prior to starting the match, the players can decide to have a two-leg home and away confrontation.&#10;&#10;Major part of the game is deckbuilding and playing cards.&#10;&#10;This game includes the following components: 50 team cards; 84 match cards; 2 Kop cards; 8 help cards; 24 score cards; 70 tokens; 1 Pee Wee rulebook; 1 Expert rulebook; 2 six-sided dice; 1 multi colored dice; Dimensions of the box 9.1 x 6.6 x 1.2 inches (230x168x35mm); Dimensions of the cards 3.1 x 2.4 inches (88x63mm).&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Description&#10;ILLEGAL is a crazy, offbeat party game for 5 to 9 players where participants each take on the role of an illegal dealer. The game is accessible to casual as well as expert gamers, and has a mature theme. The rules of ILLEGAL are simple, but the game will challenge your skills in negotiation, misdirection, discretion, charisma, and persuasion. The more you play, the more you will learn to expand and master these skills. Each game lasts about half an hour, and is packed with intense exchanges, interactions and a lot of humour.&#10;&#10;Launch into this risqu&eacute; adventure! Dare to become one of these offbeat dealers and get a good laugh with your friends.&#10;&#10;How to Play&#10;&#10;ILLEGAL is played in two phases:&#10;&#10;During the first phase, each player receives a deck of cards prepared by the Game Master (GM). These decks assign each player his dealer role and gives him a good quantity of the corresponding resources. Each player's deck also specifies his buyer role, and he will make every effort during the game to get as many resources as possible of the type he is interested in. These roles are kept secret until the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Players leave the table and split up into continually changing pairs or groups to negotiate and exchange some of their resources, away from prying eyes. Every three minutes, they return to the table to collect new resources at the docks (from the GM). Then they go again for another three minutes of secret dealing.&#10;&#10;The second phase, called the Tribunal phase, starts once the players have returned to the table and the GM has run out of resources.&#10;&#10;At the tribunal, players play the roles of jury members, witnesses, suspects and judges! They openly discuss their suspicions concerning the secret roles assigned to every other player. The GM reveals the suspect cards in pairs representing the dealer and buyer roles assigned to the various players. For each card pair, players have one minute to debate. After one minute, a simultaneous vote is cast, and a suspect is formally accused.&#10;&#10;Scoring&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, each player reveals his role pair and acquired resources. He scores one victory point for each resource acquired corresponding to his buyer role, one point for each suspect card accusing him wrongly, thus rewarding him for his skills in misdirection and discretion, but he loses 5 points for each suspect card accurately accusing him, representing 5 years spent in prison. It is very easy to end the game with a 10-year jail sentence if you are insufficiently discreet or are too greedy!&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Fjordar is an epic, tactical strategy game for 1 to 4 players, set during the Norwegian Civil War. The game begins in the year 1130, when the old king Sigurd Jorsalfar dies. Each player begins the game as one of Sigurd's heirs or one of the other influential people in Norway at the time, who is vying for power in the vacuum left by the old king's death.&#10;&#10;As the game progresses through the 110 years of the conflict, players will use their heirs that are spread around the board to either strengthen their influence through marriage, or to continue the fight for control over Norway. By gaining glory in combat you can also attract famous warriors to your cause.&#10;&#10;The game is played on a modular, semi-abstract, three dimensional board with a typical Norwegian coastal landscape, with mountains, fjords and islands, without being a map of Norway. Since the board is modular, players can set up the board in a new way each time they play, giving them the possibility for endless variety.&#10;&#10;A player's turn in Fjordar typically goes like this:  You play a card with movement points and various abilities, and use the movement points to move your units and establish supplylines. If you have moved one or more of your units into an area with enemy soldiers, you and the other player resolve combat by each choosing a combat card in secret and reveal them simultaneously, with the combat cards adding extra strength to your units' base strength. What combat card is the most effective is highly dependent on each situation. &#10;You may then use your units to perform various actions at the different locations on the board. In forests you can build new ships, churches and villages. In villages you can muster troops and collect taxes, while in the castles you can marry away your heirs or bring them home to your own castle along your supplylines.&#10;&#10;Some of the effects on previously played movement cards and combat cards also carry over to your later turns, which means that through proper planning, and adding the right persons to your cause, you can build up to some very effective turns later in the game.&#10;&#10;Points are scored for building new stave churches, burning stave churches, founding new villages, igniting beacons and moving your heirs between castles. The game is over when a player has reached a certain number of points, whereupon there is a final score count where you may score extra points depending on how much glory you have gained in battle and what families you have connected to through marriage.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The color of the chosen die determines in which block the animal goes. An animal on the white dice may be placed in any block, except for the baby block.

The board is a long track of hexes that wind back and forth in an 'S' pattern. Each person places his 'boat' on the start space with one of the numbers facing forwards. Each person also starts with a number of 'Logs'. These are used to move your boat forward 1 space for each log spent. (You can also decide to move backwards - gaining 1 log for each space moved back).&#10;&#10;Now comes the complication - bumping. If your boat stops in a space that is adjacent to 1 or more others, bumping occurs. To determine where your boat ends up you look at the hex sides facing each other (on your boat and on the adjacent one(s)). You subtract the adjacent boat's hex side number from yours - and if it is positive your boat moves forward that number of spaces, and if negative - the other boat moves forward that number of spaces. Now you check to see if your boat is adjacent to another boat and if so repeat the bumping procedure.&#10;&#10;If your boat is next to more than 1 boat, and has at least 1 positive difference, your boat moves forward. If you have more than 1 positive, add them together and move forward that distance. If you have a negative difference the other boats move in clockwise order.&#10;&#10;For subsequent turns - you can freely change the facing (&amp; thus the hex side number facing forward) by 60 degrees. Moving it further than 1 hexside costs you 1 &quot;log&quot; per extra 60 degree facing change. You then decide whether to move forward or back and resolve any bumping.&#10;&#10;The first boat to the finish wins.&#10;&#10;",

This TCG innovation allows players to use characters and action scenes from the movies on their cards to help control their fleets of PocketModel ships as they attempt to destroy each other&rsquo;s objectives.  This exciting, easy-to-learn game derives its content from all six Star Wars movies, making it possible for fans of all generations to enjoy battling for control of the galaxy!&quot;&#10;&#10;The pieces of the model are punched out from pre-painted plastic cards, and snapped together with interlocking tabs.  Stats for each model are summarized on the base.  Each pack came with a set of cards that were used to enhance the models.  Each pack also came with a play mat that summarized the rules and provided the play area.&#10;&#10;To play the full game, each player needed a thirty card deck, and thirty build stars worth of models.  Each model has one, two or three (or more) small stars on the rear of the base.  This is the cost of the model.  The more rare the model, or how large it is, the more build stars it costs.&#10;&#10;Related to:&#10;&#10;    Pirates of the Caribbean PocketModel Game&#10;&#10;&#10;",

People were dancing, reading, playing. Suddenly the weather changed. No one was ready&hellip; Except for you, a clever merchant. Sell umbrellas when it rains, ice cream when it&rsquo;s hot, tea and coffee when it&rsquo;s cold, kites when it's windy, and lanterns when it's foggy. Park Life has 5 weather-based suits.&#10;&#10;But customers are savvy, so only the merchant with the last lowest price will make the sale. The lowest value card on suit wins the trick, but it is also is worth fewer points in the end. Additionally, every sale drains your supplies, so you discard extra cards face down when you win a trick.&#10;&#10;You can quickly make many small sales, but you&rsquo;ll go home before others, giving them the opportunity to make dramatic comebacks! But wait too long and others will make some solid sales, ensuring their lead. Park Life: People includes set collecting and wild cards to add new strategies that benefit from going deep into one suit or wide into many small valued cards. The merchant who has made the most money at the end of three rounds wins!&#10;&#10;For solo and co-op, there are set point goals needed to win, or play against the automa with rules in the deluxe rule book (you can download the deluxe rules for free below).&#10;&#10;As a may-follow trick taking game, you have agency to choose what strategy you want based on the cards dealt to you and the choices of others. This well-balanced hand management and action economy game avoids perfect information and fills Park Life with rich choices.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;Although very similar to Park Life: Hedgehog, this design isn't just different in aesthetics but also by its deck composition (5 suits numbered 1-7 and the inclusion of wild cards and set collecting cards), by its scoring (done only after 3 rounds), by the lack of card reset after a round and by its winning condition (most points after the third round wins). It is considered a bit less family-friendly and more oriented towards &quot;gamers&quot;.&#10;&#10;",

Then the turn goes to the next player.&#10;&#10;Publisher's summary&#10;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#232;&#190;&#178;&#229;&#174;&#182;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#232;&#177;&#134;&#231;&#149;&#145;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#142;&#152;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#232;&#177;&#134;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#232;&#166;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#232;&#137;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#231;&#181;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#191;&#229;&#144;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#187;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#230;&#151;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#138;&#229;&#186;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#163;&#178;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#135;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#232;&#177;&#134;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#163;&#178;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#230;&#156;&#128;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#227;&#131;&#158;&#227;&#131;&#161;&#227;&#130;&#163;&#239;&#188;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#138;&#233;&#135;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#141;&#152;&#228;&#189;&#141;&#239;&#188;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#168;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#160;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#229;&#136;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#232;&#177;&#134;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#166;&#227;&#130;&#163;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#131;&#149;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#150;&#185;&#230;&#179;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#231;&#141;&#178;&#229;&#190;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#130;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#233;&#155;&#134;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#232;&#177;&#134;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#181;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#191;&#229;&#144;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#229;&#163;&#178;&#229;&#141;&#180;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#138;&#233;&#135;&#145;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#190;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#230;&#172;&#178;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#188;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#230;&#176;&#151;&#230;&#140;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "In Night Market, you are a business owner who is trying to construct stalls to sell food to customers with distinctive tastes. These customers will move through your night market looking for their cravings to be fulfilled. To capitalize, you must acquire different foods from the city and strategically place them in your night market to accommodate your customers. Furthermore, your customers are also seeking and are willing to pay more for specialty dishes. The challenge is you only have so much time to shop for ingredients and prepare for the market&rsquo;s opening. Customers that are satiated, will become loyal customers and come back for another visit. Customers that are disappointed, will leave. Night Market couples a spatial worker placement mechanism with challenging resource management to maintain customer loyalty resulting in sales. At the end of the game, the player who has earned the most reputation will be regarded as the &ldquo;Best Night Market&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;A Note from the Designer:&#10;When I moved to Taiwan in 2010, it did not take long to fall in love with night markets&mdash;the vibrant colors, the bustling alleyways, and of course, the food. I quickly realized that the night market was a microcosm of Taiwanese culture. So, like many travelers, I made a point to visit the major night market in each city I visited to sample the regional dish that made each market &ldquo;famous.&rdquo; What I did not realize until after a few years of living in Taiwan is that night markets are ubiquitous. Every neighborhood has one. You could walk through a seemingly quiet alleyway and stumble across an absolute gem of a night market that features the city&rsquo;s best beef noodles. This is what I wanted to capture in the design of this game: that the food of any small night market can easily compete with that of the major ones.&#10;&#10;While I could not possibly include all the famous dishes that Taiwan has to offer, I chose a few iconic ones mixed with my personal favorites. I hope this game gives you a glimpse of an aspect of Taiwanese culture that I fell in love with in my time living there, and more so, I hope that you will be able to experience a Taiwanese night market yourself one day.&#10;&#10;Thanks for playing!&#10;-Adam Zwain&#10;&#10;",

A player reaches a planet by earning 12 movement points toward that planet.  The game is played in a series of rounds until someone wins.&#10;&#10;In each round, players are dealt 6 &quot;ship&quot; cards (which are 1 of 4 colors, or suits, numbered from 1-4).  They simultaneously pass 2 cards to each other. Players then simultaneously play 1 card at one of the 3 planets, until all 6 cards are played (and they must play them so 2 cards are at each planet).&#10;&#10;Players score &quot;movement&quot; points in 1 of 3 ways.  (1) When placing a ship card, players score a movement point if the ship card color matches the icon on top of their movement card (which is used to keep track of the movement points, so this icon color keeps changing).&#10;&#10;(2) By having the best 2-card hand at a planet. Using typical poker-like ranks, players compare hands and the best hand earns 2 movement points.&#10;&#10;(3) Each card, in addition to having a suit and a number, has an arrow that can be oriented to point left or right (by rotating the card).  The player earns a bonus movement if the arrow color matches the color of cards played in the adjacent column.&#10;&#10;The game is very portable, consisting of only 25 cards.&#10;&#10;For 1-player, there is a mechanism for competing against a dummy player.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

The sacrifices are scattered on the altar and the king is demanding a reading.&#10;&#10;It&rsquo;s time to make a future for yourself.&#10;&#10;OBJECT&#10;Manipulate the Bird Sacrifice Tiles (referred to as &ldquo;BS Tiles&rdquo;) into lines of 3 with a shared attribute, called Portents, to collect Omen Tokens from the outside of the Altar. Use Portents to make sets of Omens with a common attribute called Fortunes. Create one Fortune of 4 Omens or two Fortunes of 3 Omens to win!&#10;&#10;TURN SEQUENCE&#10;Each turn has two phases: Sleight of Hand and then Scrying.&#10;&#10;In the Sleight of Hand phase, the active player manipulates the arrangement and composition of the BS Tiles on the Altar.&#10;&#10;In the Scrying Phase the active player performs upkeep on the Altar and collects Omens for their Fortunes.&#10;&#10;SLEIGHT OF HAND&#10;There are 3 steps in the Sleight of Hand Phase. It represents waving one&rsquo;s hands over the altar with occult flair. Improvised incantations are encouraged.&#10;&#10;1. Push&#10;The active player may push 1, 2, or 3 tiles off the Altar from a single side. These BS tiles may be pushed in any arrangement as long as they move in the same direction from the same side.&#10;&#10;2. Replace&#10;After tiles are pushed off of the Altar, the active player fills the empty spaces on the Altar with new tiles from their hand. They may place their tiles freely in the empty spaces.&#10;&#10;3. Palm&#10;All the tiles that the active player Pushed off of the Altar enter their hand for the next turn.&#10;&#10;SCRYING&#10;This phase combines scoring and upkeep. There may be up to 4 steps depending on the game state. They are performed in the order below.&#10;&#10;1. Check for New Portents&#10;The active player checks the Altar for any new Portents. If any are present on the Altar proceed to step 2. If not, skip to step 4.&#10;&#10;2. Collect Omens&#10;If any of the new Portents on the Altar are in a line with an Omen Token, the player immediately collects the Omen(s).&#10;&#10;3. Ignite New Burnt Offerings&#10;For each new Portent on the Altar, the player chooses a tile to turn into a Burnt Offering and flips it over to its lit side. Every new Portent requires a new Burnt Offering of its own.&#10;&#10;4. Snuff Old Burnt Offerings&#10;If any Burnt Offerings were on the Altar during the Sleight of Hand phase, check if they are still a part of a Portent. If they are no longer a part of any Portent, flipping the Burnt Offering tile to its unlit side. If flipping a Burnt Offering over would create a new Portent, it stays lit.&#10;&#10;",

Unlike chess, the board for Smess has various types of arrows printed on each square of the &quot;chess&quot; board.  Movement is determined by the direction of the arrow or arrows in the square.  The pieces are similar to chess in that the Brain is like a king in chess, Ninnies are like pawns, and Numskulls are like rooks or bishops.  This is a fun game that is much simpler than chess at first glance. However, the game will vary in difficulty depending on the skill of the opponent.  The goal is to capture your opponent's Brain.  The fact that both players can &quot;see&quot; all possible moves to and from a square can make the game harder than you'd think!  A fun game!&#10;&#10;The game was later released with medieval themed pieces under the title All the King's Men.&#10;&#10;",

Watch as your ball comes perilously close to each hazard. Did you plan the shot well enough to keep your ball on course?&#10;&#10;Each hole is created using a series of modular game cards. Hazards and features can be set up at random or arranged to resemble any hole from any golf course in the world.&#10;&#10;Once the hole is assembled, players must choose the right club, aim carefully (taking wind into account) and hit the ball with the right swing tempo. Too fast and you'll lose control of the ball. Too slow and your ball won't go far enough.&#10;&#10;The core of the game uses a clever movement mechanic that combines loss of control with distance. You use a number of dice to represent swing tempo (one two or three for slow, moderate and fast). Doubles and triples represent the effects of wind and slope, causing your ball to make semi-random deviations from a straight shot. Roll more dice and you're more likely to lose control and have your ball drift off course!&#10;&#10;",

In a game using the Basic Rules cards stay face up. With the Complete Rules you play with hidden cards and the games become much more fun because it becomes harder to foresee enemy interactions. In fact, many cards can be played that may break your opponent's sequence of play, during his/her turn. Also, with the Complete Rules you play with Special Cards that always offer different ways of being used. It's up to you to choose the best way, based on differing game situations.&#10;&#10;Enjoy hit and be hit, and have fun! Peace, Love... Fight!&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Peacebowl Six&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Unfortunately, it's so good that other Necromancers are now competing with you for the choice cemeteries!&#10;&#10;Players start with zombies of varying values.  They take turns placing zombies in specific location to &quot;dig&quot; up graves, steal from opposing laboratories and vaults, and to attack other player's zombies to try and prevent them from digging or stealing (and possibly dismember the opposing zombie beyond further use).&#10;&#10;Once all the zombies have been placed, zombies still in position will steal body parts or treasure from opponents, and those set to dig will dig the row, column, or specific space of the graveyard they are assigned to.  If you are competing for spaces in the graveyard (which is the norm), players compare the combined brainpower of their digging zombies, and the higher value gets to the contents of the grave first.&#10;&#10;Then you may use your new-found corpse pieces and equipment to assemble new zombies to do your bidding!&#10;&#10;The goal is to have the highest total in treasure and unused body parts at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;",

Snipers will target you as you move street to street. You may not know who you are facing until you directly assault them. They may be Guerrillas, ready to evade you with pre-planned escape routes. They may be Martyrs, who will fight to the death. Or may just be false leads.&#10;&#10;If by the game's end the USMC does not control all the zones on the map, you lose. Otherwise you calculate victory points based on time taken and friendly and insurgent losses to determine if you achieved a major, minor or costly victory.&#10;&#10;The game emphasizes and rewards the use of real life urban warfare tactics, including different modes of assaulting a building and positioning of assets to hinder enemy sniper fire or reinforce key positions.&#10;&#10;About the Second Edition&#10;This Second Edition introduces more variability in the strengths of insurgents faced, and a range of new optional rules including insurgent direct fire and RPG attacks, and local population and civilian effects to account for.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Players take turns pulling robot parts (heads, bases, arms, hands, batteries, antennas and magnets). Not all robot parts can be taken, however. The line you're pulling from must be switched to ON. Robot parts that aren't taken will be discarded onto the junk pile. Players can pay a dollar to go through the junk pile or they can pay a dollar to turn ON/OFF switches. As players take robot parts, they build robots in front of them. Players can build up to four robots in a game.

While you're building, you'll want to look to the buyers to meet their requirements. A requirement might be a robot with four eyes, or a robot that has no wheels, or a robot with three hands. If you meet a buyer's requirement, you sell it for money. If you meet the bonuses, like medical, war, or cleaning, you get even more money.

The werewolves kill a member of the village each night. During the day the remaining villagers need to find out who are the werewolves and lynch them, before they are all killed. The werewolves are considered winners once their number equals the number of the remaining survivors.&#10;&#10;Wolfed is both simple and amusing game. It is an awesome way to break the ice especially for parties, team buildings, or just a way to have fun with your friends or complete strangers. It is an amazing social experience. Each game is unique on its own as there are near infinite number of combinations that you can play.&#10;&#10;Wolfed has unique art-style. Each character in the game has its own design. There are no 2 cards that look alike. There are also event cards which bring twists and turns in each game. And of course at the end we added a pinch of new roles you have never seen before. They have been thoroughly tested to make sure that the balance remains unchanged. &#10;The rules have been improved and written from scratch to make sure they are easily understandable.&#10;&#10;",

Players play on the side of the board that rotates to meet them each round. At the beginning of the game, client cards are drawn and placed in front of each ticket booth in sets of three. In each round, all players simultaneously choose and play one of their carrossel cards, numbered from 1 to 12, and one of their carrossel tiles that come in twelve tiles of four different colors/types, plus two wild tiles. The carrossel tiles are simultaneously placed on the spaces indicated by the carrossel cards. Players are looking to get three carrossel tiles in a row that match the three corresponding client cards. Whenever they achieve this, they place client stand-ups on each of them to show that those tickets have been sold and give the cards to the respective players who earned them (the owners of the carrossel tiles).&#10;While it is possible to complete a sequence with only your own tiles, most sequences will be completed by using tiles from other players. Making sure you get more points out each sequence than any other player is a strong path to victory. Also there are 4 variable endgame objectives that will score additional points to those who complete them.&#10;&#10;The game ends when either one player cannot perform a legal play or the client deck runs out. The player with the most total victory points (clients + objectives) wins.&#10;&#10;",

The soccer player names are quite hard to say because the author deliberately invented really strange and long names.&#10;&#10;To win you have to put the ball in the net more times than other team.&#10;&#10;The game is noisy and hilarious. Each coach gets an action card. Each player get a &quot;number&quot; that represent the t-shirt number of the figures they will control (more than one there are less than 14 players).&#10;&#10;Only the coach see the action card and have to call BY NAME (of soccer players not of the people playing the game) to indicate where to move to without talking, without indicating the wooden soccer players. The only way to communicate is to give him indications with his hands or miming something as real coach do.&#10;&#10;Every time a wooden soccer player is in the right position the coach scream &quot;PASS IT&quot; and so on the other wooden soccer player until the last is positioned and the coach screams &quot;SHOOOOOT!!!&quot;&quot;&#10;&#10;All the players stop play. If the team is positioned exactly as the action card requires, the last player who moved a wooden soccer player for the team throws a die to score a goal.&#10;&#10;Some penalties are given to the coach for performing forbidden actions (like calling wooden soccer players by number or indicating it by pointing) and if the action card is not correctly reproduced.&#10;&#10;RETHEMED : HysteriCoach Hockey&#10;&#10;",

In Riftwalker, players use a central grid of elements composed of earth, wind, fire, water, storm, and life to play rift cards from their hand or shift rifts they already have in play.&#10;&#10;Shifting a Rift is a Riftwalker's magical ability to change the nature of a place by calling on and altering the elements. Shifting turns a card sideways and increases its point value. Every time a rift card is played or shifted, it activates a special power that alters a player's cards or the central grid in a useful way. As the game progresses, players will build up a unique set of abilities.&#10;&#10;Earth rifts empower shifted rifts while fire burns them down for points. Water rifts spread more rifts across the land and life rifts grow them to great value. Storm rifts control the element grid and wind rifts play all kinds of tricks. However, a rift can only be shifted twice, so no power lasts forever. Eventually, players must create lines of elements on the grid to score their rifts. Some cards give bonus points for scoring the right kind of rifts. In the end, the player with the greatest rifts and the most points wins the game!&#10;&#10;",
