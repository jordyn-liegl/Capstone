    "description": "It&rsquo;s year 999. The Christianisation of the Scandinavian countries is ongoing, but some Vikings are stubborn and are fighting to keep their culture and their beliefs. A new territory has been discovered, which could be the promised land they have always looked for, where gods walk alongside the worthy; a land of opulence, abundant harvests and good living, the very idea of Valhalla.&#10;&#10;The first expedition settled there and founded a colony. Months later, a second expedition is sent there. The sea voyage goes very terribly and many men die. A small band of survivors arrive hungry and exhausted at the colony camp, which does not look at all like what they imagined. They discover an icy and disturbing place, immersed in the mist, surrounded by an oppressive forest... and empty! None of the settlers are there. What was their longship is planted into the earth in the centre of the camp like a sinister totem. They will have to rebuild the camp, survive the hostile conditions, explore this cold and frightening land before understanding what happened and solve the mystery.&#10;&#10;HEL: The Last Saga is a cooperative survival horror viking board game, created by the duo behind SMOG: Rise of Moloch by CMON, game designer David Rakoto and art director Christophe Madura. The game offers players the chance to lead a small group of survivors, each with their own background and secret motives. The players must cooperate if they want to survive the immediate dangers of cold, hunger and external threats, but they will also have to complete their inner quest to be worthy of the Saga that will retain their name. HEL: The Last Saga is highly narrative, with chapters to read according to what the players accomplish. The game mechanisms mix exploration, tactical combat with a bit of resource management. Storytelling and background are ubiquitous and replayability comes from the unique way you have to replay a failed mission.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The cash flow in the game consists of taxes (for players staying on others' possessions) and events from &quot;Chance&quot; cards (fines, taxes, misfortunes). In a difficult situation, players can pledge their properties &ndash; otherwise, the player bankrupts and loses the game.&#10;&#10;Goal&#10;The goal of the game is to be the last player remaining with any money &ndash; after everyone else's bankruptcy or after established time os over.&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;Game mechanics is almost exactly the same like in Monopoly.&#10;&#10;Each turn, the player rolls two dice, moves around the board and buys properties located in various European countries (from communist period), grouped by their region.&#10;1) If a player lands on an unexploited property, he can buy it or allow the bank to auction it to other players.&#10;2) If he lands on someone's property, he must pay its owner a rent (proportional to the value of the land and its buildings).&#10;3) If the property belongs to the player and he has all the lands in the country, he can build houses or hotels that increase rent for visitors.&#10;There are also other places on the board that you can't buy, but they require the player to draw a &quot;Chance&quot; card, pay taxes, collect income, and even go to jail. Each player also has regular income everytime they pass the starting field.&#10;&#10;Properties are located in countries listed below (from cheapest to most expensive):&#10;&#10;     South: Greece (2 properties) &ndash; yellow color, Italy (3) &ndash; red color.&#10;     West: Spain (3) &ndash; blue color and Great Britain (3) &ndash; orange color.&#10;     North: Benelux (Holland, Belgium and Luxembourg, summary 3 properties) &ndash; green color and Sweden (3) &ndash; purple color&#10;     East: RFN /West Germany/ (3) &ndash; brown color and Austria (2) &ndash; black color.&#10;&#10;&#10;The game continues until everyone but one player leave the game (bankrupt) or until an established time is over. I the latter case all players sum up they fortune &ndash; cash, power plant, railway stations, water supply, properties (not taken to pledge) with the value of buildings, half value of properties taken to pledge.&#10;&#10;It is still avaible in shops for around 8$.&#10;&#10;",

Kids love the suspense as they watch his belly grow; the player who makes his belly burst loses the game. Redesigned in 2013 to make it easier for kids 4 and up to play, children can quickly reset this pig game with one pump of the pig&rsquo;s head and experience consistent belly busting game-play each and every time. Pop the Pig provides hours of fun and is completely kid powered (no batteries needed). For added convenience, all pieces can be stored inside the pig. Kids won&rsquo;t see a pop up pirate, but they will get to pop a pig. For ages 4 and up, 2-6 players. From the makers of Gooey Louie and Jumping Jack.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "The game 'box' has levers labelled from one to nine. (There are also sets made with 1-12.)&#10;&#10;Initially all the levers are in the 'up' position.&#10;&#10;The first player rolls two dice.  He or she then knocks down the levers as follows:&#10;&#10;One number which is the combined value of both dice.&#10;&#10;Or...&#10;&#10;Two numbers whose total adds up to the combined total of each dice.&#10;&#10;For example:&#10;&#10;If a one and a five are rolled, the player may choose to knock down the lever covering the number six, or the levers covering numbers one AND five, or ANY other combination of numbers adding up to six.&#10;&#10;The player continues to roll, knocking down levers each turn, until he or she cannot use the whole of the dice count because those numbers in the box have already been covered. (Note: If the 7,8 &amp; 9 are covered, some versions let you choose to roll one or two dice. Some use that rule if the total of the remaining numbers is less than six.)&#10;&#10;The player's score is the total value of the numbers left uncovered (in some versions the score is instead read directly from the numbers left on the box -- if the 2, 4, &amp; 6 are left, then your score is 246).  All the levers are then raised again, and play passes to the next player.&#10;&#10;There are several methods of scoring. In the traditional pub gambling game, you add up all the levers left uncovered. The games pays out after one round (one turn per player who paid into the pool). If you manage to &quot;shut the box&quot; you win instantly and get double the stake from each player.&#10;&#10;In other scoring methods, you play multiple rounds, with players adding points to their previous score. As players reach forty-five (or other set number) they go 'bust' and must drop out of the game. The game then ends when only one player remains in the game.  He or she is the winner.&#10;&#10;If any player knocks down ALL the levers in his or her turn, and thus 'shuts the box', they are automatically declared the winner!&#10;&#10;This was later the inspiration for the NBC Daytime TV game show High Rollers airing from 1974 until 1975 and again from 1979 until 1980 under the name as (The New) High Rollers and much later in Syndication from 1975 until 1976 and from 1987 until 1988.&#10;&#10;",

Each round, prices for each type of gem may increase by 1, decrease by 1, or stay unchanged. Players must buy cheap gems to sell them at higher prices later, but this is all about probability and reality as well. To win, you have to diversify your stock, but you are limited on initial capital and the number of gems in the bazaar is limited as well. The first player changes each round clockwise, giving all players equal chances to plan their moves and make short- or long-term investments. At the end of the game, the player with most money wins!&#10;&#10;",

Players keep their penguins behind screens so that no one knows who has which colors.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player adds a penguin to the pyramid. The first penguins are placed in the bottom row (obviously), but once two penguins are adjacent, a penguin matching the color of either of those penguins can be placed on top of them; e.g., either a red or blue penguin can be placed on top of adjacent red and blue penguins. The bottom row can be no more than seven penguins long. If a player knocks down the pyramid, he takes penalty points equal to the number of penguins behind his screen, then players start again from scratch. When a player can't play &mdash; whether because he has no penguins at all or no penguins that can legally be played &mdash; he passes. Once all players pass, the round ends and everyone scores one penalty point for each of his unplayed penguins. Anyone who played all of his penguins returns two penalty points.&#10;&#10;After playing as many rounds as the number of players, the game ends and whoever has the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;",

Not all of you might live while tracking down this food, but ideally at least one of you will make it to the end of the trail with a full belly.&#10;&#10;To set up, shuffle the hunting cards, then lay them out in a 6x6 grid, with three cards in each pile. Shuffle the supply deck, then lay out four supply cards, which are available for you to use. Place the hunter on a pile on the outside border of the playing area. Each player takes a die, which has numbers 1/1/2/2/3/4.&#10;&#10;On a turn, the active player rolls their die, then has a number of actions equal to the result. A player can (1) flip a card in an orthogonal line from the hunter up to a distance equal to the number of actions that remain in the turn, (2) move orthogonally to an adjacent space that isn't blocked, or (3) shoot at an animal that isn't blocked. If you flip flowers, a tree, or a rock, that space is now blocked; if you flip an abandoned wagon, you can pillage it for a card of your choice from the supply deck, but then it too becomes an obstacle; if you flip a blank card, nothing happens; and if you flip an animal, you can try to shoot it on a future action as long as nothing blocks the hunter's path to it.&#10;&#10;When you shoot, you spend a bullets token, then all players roll their die and you need successes on all dice, e.g. rolls of 1 or 2 to kill a bison. If you don't succeed, you can spend more bullets and reroll the dice that failed. If you succeed, you get one hundred pounds of meat; if you run out of actions or decide to stop, the animal flees.&#10;&#10;You have only twelve bullet tokens at the start of the game, with four more in the supply deck. If you run out of bullets, you lose the game. If you flip dysentery or drowning, you die and everyone else carries on without you; if you flip snake bite, broken leg, or other calamities, you need the treatment from the supply deck, dying if an identical card is flipped before this happens. If all players die or the hunter becomes trapped by obstacles, you lose the game. Only by collecting six hundred pounds of meat do you win, no matter how many of you are still alive!&#10;&#10;The Oregon Trail: Hunt for Food Card Game can be played on its own or combined with The Oregon Trail Card Game.&#10;&#10;",

The journey goes from a croft via a farm to a manor and ends with the castle (UK: Stately home).&#10;&#10;The game features a roll-and-move style of movement around the board, success relying on having your marker stopping on the good spaces so you get crop markers that you can sell later on. Farms and forests are bought and sold by the money you earn from the events and crops.&#10;&#10;Though being an absolute classic in Sweden, and one of the flagships for the game publisher Alga, very little is known of this game's origin. It has seen at least four graphically major remakes since the first version. It's rumoured to be as old as the 40s, at least we know that the game existed in 1951.&#10;&#10;The now defunct publisher AB Sago-Konst is rumoured to be the first publisher. When they in the 1950's became, or became part of (history is unclear here),  AB Grafisk konst the latter published another more or less identical version. They were followed by Aristospel with yet another more or less identical version. Since approx. 1974 Alga (currently owned by Brio, itself owned by Ravensburger) has published this game in about half a dozen editions.&#10;&#10;See the information tab on the various versions for details about them.&#10;&#10;",

As for the reasons why this is so, please see the clarifications at the end of this article and the article of Anti-Monopoly.)&#10;&#10;In this game the players follow either the rules for Monopolists or those for Competitors. Competitors charge fair rents, build as soon as they own a property, place four houses (green) at the most, after which they build a hotel (red) and occasionally go to Price War. On the other hand, Monopolists extort monopoly-high rents from their poor tenants, build only after they have at least two streets of one color, restrict supply by putting only three houses on their properties, after which they also are allowed to build a hotel (red) and occasionally go to prison!&#10;&#10;The good guys are the small entrepreneurs and the bad guys are the monopolists. Since players do not play by the same rules, fairness is achieved by a win probability equalization technique (which is where the second author comes in).&#10;&#10;Competitors make more money than Monopolists in the beginning of the game but Monopolists can catch up later, especially if Competitors don't watch their money!&#10;&#10;The game was first published as &quot;Choice&quot; because Anspach was forbidden to use the word &quot;Monopoly&quot; by the courts. When that was overturned in 1983, the name was changed to &quot;Anti-Monopoly II&quot;. In 1987, believing that consumer confusion between Anti-Monopoly and Anti-Monopoly II was harming sales of the latter game, Anspach ceased the production of the original game and removed the &quot;II&quot; from the name of the latter game.&#10;&#10;",

The score card shows the actual result you want to achieve, each player wanting the 4 cars to finish in a different order. The movement cards have 3 functions, showing number of spaces to move, or direction to move in, or 2 vehicles out of the 4 available that you could move. Start order changes each turn, the first player chooses one card of the three available, the next chooses a different type of card, the 3rd player the last type. The final player decides which car moves of the 2 cars that have been chosen as possible cars to move. The board also has random oil patches and hazards.&#10;&#10;",

It often hosts teams from other countries.&#10;&#10;All the marbles are placed inside a circle drawn in the dirt. The object is to get all of them out. Take turns propelling your shooter marble from the circle's edge at the marbles in the middle. When the marbles are all outside of the circle, you count up the ones you have put there. The winner is the one with the most marbles. Some play that this person takes all the marbles.&#10;&#10;Some play that if the shooter marble leaves the circle during the shot the marbles knocked out by that shot are put back in.&#10;&#10;",

Assets are earned primarily by passing Payday spots on the game board.  Money is also earned (and sometimes lost) by drawing Action cards, which assign set amounts or multiples of the wheel spin.&#10;&#10;There is a very linear board that you move along by spinning a wheel.  There are a handful of intersections where you can choose to go one direction or another but they ultimately have similar spaces and meet back up quickly.  The first one is a decision to either attend college (payment due and a longer track), or not - with different career cards drawn as a result of that decision.  There are a handful of choices regarding house speculation, but for the most part it is a game of luck.&#10;&#10;This game makes a number of updates to older games in the game family.  The maximum number of players has been reduced from 6 to 4, and a number of new cards and concepts have been introduced, increasing the randomness of asset collection.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Castle Assault is a unique gaming experience combining the ferocious onslaught of Tower Defense games with the strategic elements of CCGs and progressive advancement of RPG's.  Castle Assault seeks to break the mold of traditional card games and organically extracts the most enjoyable parts of these different genres and distill them into a standalone concept. Castle Assault plays in about 30 mins, and is for 1 or 2 Players.&#10;&#10;Each Player controls a Castle on either side of the Battlefield with 10 Health and a Hero outside of the Battlefield.  Players play Units from their hand to the gameboard and these Units physically move toward the opposing Castle based on the Abilities of that Unit and your choices with the intent to bring your opponent from 10 to 0 Health.  Should you destroy your opponents Castle or destroy their Hero you win!&#10;&#10;&quot;More details please&quot; - a Battle Card Game with tons of combat and strategy.  Card combat is fast and furious; every time two opposing Units touch each other in the same column, they Engage in combat (which is often), and can happen either during the Move Units step or during the Open Phase by Charging or using an Ability described on your Units.  Combat is resolved immediately with Unit cards exchanging their combat values at the same time (with no luck involved).  Should either Unit have a higher attack number then the Armor + Health of the opposing Unit, that Unit is destroyed.  Should a Unit smash the opposing Castle without a defending unit, that Unit attacks the opposing Castle directly lowering that Castles Health by the Unit's attack value.&#10;&#10;Your Hero grants some bonuses throughout the game and you can even join the Battlefield to turn the tide, however should your Hero be destroyed you immediately lose the game.  As you progress through the 1-Player Campaign and complete feats or heroism you can level up and customize your Hero based on the way YOU play. &#10; Every deck is also customizable meaning your Unit selection can be optimized before battle, but note this is not a 'pay-to-play' type game.  You receive all the cards from all warbands including the 1-Player warband in the Core Edition (NO BOOSTERS).&#10;&#10;Most Units have Abilities to; keep them alive, move more quickly, laterally move, resurrect, summon allies, surprise, dissipate, and damage the opposing Castle from afar.  You may feign attacks, play Commands to make your Heroes more powerful in a myriad of methods to tactically breakdown your opponent.&#10;&#10;The 1-Player Campaign provides a &quot;Right-Outta-the-Box Experience&quot; with 9 Scenarios culminating in a final boss showdown.  1-Player mode operates by Monsters auto-populating in the opposing Castle with your victory condition changing every Scenario including outright smashing the opposing Castle, destroying a boss overlord, or surviving the onslaught.  With 9 Scenarios per 6 warbands it creates 54 different challenges  (9 campaigns x 6 warbands = 54 games).&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "The concept of Arne is new. Arne is cheeky, creative, and chaotic. And always spiced with the most unexpected turns. As a player, you change the direction of the game, take over someone&rsquo;s turn, protect your own cards, steal someone else&rsquo;s and wreck the strategy of your opponents. Your luck can turn at any moment: Arne literally goes every which way.&#10;&#10;Arne is suitable for all ages. A few practice games, and children from the age of seven start playing seriously. Boys and girls mainly enjoy the high tease factor of the game. But the countless combination possibilities make the game just as much fun for adults. You don&rsquo;t have to know Arne inside out to score well: luck plays an important part. Parents, children, grandparents &hellip; everybody&rsquo;s chances for winning are the same.&#10;&#10;There are no words printed on the Arne cards. So the game is universal: people of various mother tongues can play together perfectly well. Another great advantage is that the game does not take long to play: a round of Arne takes ten minutes, a quarter of an hour at the most. However, you will not know who is winning until the last cards have been played. Those who have saved plenty of points can be sent back to the beginning by just one card. And those who were not doing well can snatch victory at the very last minute.&#10;&#10;How ARNE Works!&#10;&#10;Whoever collects most points wins. Each player first chooses a color and then goes and tries to collect as many points of that color as possible. The other players try to do the same. The point of the game is to sabotage their attempts as much as possible. You do this by making use of the teaser cards. In order to make the game even more fun, there are two sorts of cards:&#10;&#10;White cards which you may only play when it is your turn &#10;Black cards which you may play whenever you want to&#10;&#10;In practice, all players can play cards at the same time. This means that the tease factor is very high indeed.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Arne Total&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The highest number you circle in a column equals the points that you score.&#10;&#10;Not happy with your results? Then roll again with any number of dice &mdash; but you have to roll an additional die as well, which means you'll circle more results on your scoresheet. You can reroll a second time as well to add a fifth die to your results. This (possibly) gives you better control over the results, while helping you ascend the columns more quickly to higher potential scores.&#10;&#10;However, at the top of each column is a different colored number that's much lower than the numbers immediately below it. Hit this number, and your balloon's popped because it went too high. What's more, this popping triggers a scoring break that occurs at the end of the round, with everyone scoring based on their current heights in the columns. You want to go high, but don't trigger the break or else your points will plummet right before scoring.&#10;&#10;After three breaks, players total their scores to see who wins.&#10;&#10;",

The basic game mechanism is trick-taking, but whoever wins the trick can distribute the cards amongst all the players, depending on his character's ability. Bilbo, for example, must keep one card from the trick, give one card to another player, then discard the remaining cards.&#10;&#10;In addition to a special ability, each character has a special affinity with the forces that govern his motives. Gandalf, Bilbo, and Thorin are scions of good, while Smaug and Bolg are cruel and evil. The cards respond to these alignments accordingly: a white star on the card symbolizes the forces of good; the helm of an orc adorns cards possessed of evil power; and a card with a pipe grants players the ability to draw an extra card in the next round. If a card with the opposite power is assigned to your character (Gandalf gets an orc helmet, or Smaug gets a star), then that character takes a point of damage. If your character is already damaged and is assigned a card with the symbol of their own side (Bilbo gets a star, or Bolg gets an orc helmet), then that character gets a single point of damage healed. Two points of damage eliminates a character from the game, so use the cards you win to knock out your opponents and heal your allies.&#10;&#10;The round ends when players have emptied their hands, and the last of the cards that were in play have been assigned to the characters. Players who have taken enough damage are eliminated at this point. Depending of the number of players, if enough good characters have survived, the game continues until the final round. If the evil characters have killed enough of the heroes, then the villains win the day!&#10;&#10;",

Now the king has died, and his heir, King Tyrial II, has decided to dispatch his finest lords to raise the fallen city and stand ground against all its enemies, within and outside the city walls.&#10;&#10;In Fallen City of Karez, each player will take the role of a lord of one of the guilds who seek to tighten their grasp on the rising city. The players will strive to maintain a balance between keeping the city safe for its citizens by sending exploration parties to defeat any threats, and at the same time attracting to the emerging city new adventurers wishing to fill their pockets with fortunes and their names with glory.&#10;&#10;In the action phase at the start of each of the eight turns, players can assign two citizens or one adventurer to act on their behalf in the various buildings of Karez, send an exploration party to remove any threats that lurk near Karez, or buy new equipment to reinforce their parties of heroes. Some guild houses may choose to erect their own private Dungeons (!) in an attempt to inflict havoc and dismay on the other houses. After everyone performs their actions, the players must check how these actions affected migration to Karez; the results of this phase will reflect on the growth of Karez towards a city state, which is the common aspiration of all players.&#10;&#10;Players start with different initial possessions and owned buildings. In addition to the common goal of raising the city, each house also has some unique goals (ambitions), which will eventually determine the sole winner. That said, the game is semi-cooperative in that while each guild has its own ambitions, all players must succeed in raising the city by the end of the game or else everyone loses.&#10;&#10;",

It includes a dolphin, a squid and a rock band of rabbits. The family are created by an artist Raityo Tsume (&#233;&#155;&#183;&#233;&#179;&#165;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#130;&#129;) and are popular in Japan in SNS messaging apps.&#10;&#10;The various characters in the Kmakici family are on the cards in different combinations. Players draw and play cards to the table from a hand of three, trying to build sets of five different characters. If a player places a card which completes a set of five, they draw a token from the end of a line.&#10;&#10;The tokens show a grilled steak initially, but on the hidden side are sweets, cakes and teatime treats. Players are trying to get four different treats to win the game outright.&#10;&#10;However, if a player cannot or will not play a card, they draw a steak, which, being unsuitable for a tea party, counts as negative points. If all the tokens are claimed without a direct winner, then the player with fewest steaks wins.&#10;&#10;Whilst the game is aimed squarely at young children, a Japanese reviewer found the game to be more complex and challenging than expected.&#10;&#10;The publisher says:&#10;Let's start a great teatime with our friends.&#10;&#10;In this game, you have to collect five different characters on the field. When it is your turn to play, you draw a card from the deck and put up to three cards from your hand on the field. However, only one card of the same type of character can be played on the field.&#10;&#10;If you manage to get the fifth character on the field, you get the candy on the back of the chip.&#10;&#10;The chips are laid out in a straight line, steak side first, and are taken in the order in which they are laid out during the game.&#10;&#10;If you don't have any cards to play or don't want to play, you

    "description": "The Club is a slightly satirical game about life in the fast lane - a board game about love and about people's need to meet one another.&#10;&#10;The whole game takes place in a nightclub and the game board is the dance floor. On their turn players push three new dancers to the dance floor from their own bar counter (edge of the game board) and as they come into play they push others towards the center of the dance floor. Once two dancers meet in the heat of the night they can be made into couples and the better the match the more players score. If only two of the four visible qualities match then the dancers have a one-night-stand which is not a very long term fun and is thus worth only one point. With three matching qualities the dancers actually like one another, start dating and that is worth four points. If all the four visible qualities match then the dancers get the &quot;happily ever after&quot; the one true love we all search for and thus it is worth full 5 points.&#10;&#10;Each dancer also has a secret quality that can and will alter the basic score. For example if a guy has a large... &quot;personality&quot; then the player gets two extra points unless the other dancer is drunk, because if she is she wouldn't notice the difference. Girl's beautiful roommate on the other hand only has a function in the one-night-stands and the fun the couple would have means now triple fun and thus the player gets triple points. There are 12 different secret qualities in the game ranging from heart-broken to those who still live with their mom.&#10;&#10;Occasionally the game gets spiced up by one of the three special characters in the game. Bouncer can remove any of the dancer from the game board where as a Rock Star walks into the game normally, but once (s)he has gathered a fan crowd and he's completely surrounded player can take the Rock Star and four adjacent dancers back to his hotel room and form two couples out of them. The bully is the guy who harasses women and picks a fight with men and once he enters the game his mere presence prevents any dancer next to him to be part of a couple.&#10;&#10;In the end the player who has been the best cupido wins the game. In other words the best scorer wins.&#10;&#10;",

The cards are dealt and each card shows a hero in a certain color and a shield in the same or another color.&#10;&#10;A card is turned over which shows, for example, a blue hero and a red shield of his opponent. Now all players have to hurry to discard a red hero. If the card shows a yellow shield, a yellow hero has to be discarded and so on. The player who managers to discard all of his cards first, receives a score disc. The one who holds the most cards at the end of the round, receives a consolation disc, which may be an advantage in a later round.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Warriors is a card and dice-rolling game with a fantasy military theme. Each player begins with a randomly dealt army of 11 units. Most will be creatures of one of the game's 6 types (Barbarians, Goblins, Elves, Trolls, Dwarves, Undead). A lucky player may also get Wizards (which protect creatures of one type from attack) or Catapults (one-use weapons that have a 50/50 chance of destroying a target card). Creatures come in three varieties (infantry, archers, cavalry).&#10;&#10;Armies are placed face-up in front of the players, and three rounds of warfare ensue. At the start of each round, players receive additional cards, including the vital Attack Cards, without which an army can only stand on the defensive. Attack cards are of two types. One (&quot;Battle&quot;) allows all of a player's creatures of one type to attack creatures of either the same type or the type that the attacker most dislikes. Elves, for instance, may attack an opponent's Elves or his Trolls (the Elves' &quot;natural enemy&quot;.) The other type of Attack Card (&quot;Mercenary Army&quot;) allows creatures of different types to combine in an attack against creatures of any one type, but limits the number of attackers. Attack Cards also provide various bonuses to the attacker.&#10;&#10;The resolution of attacks is modeled on Risk. The attacker rolls up to three dice, the defender up to two (the number depending on how many infantry each side has in the battle). The side with more archers, if either, adds one to its high die roll. The highest and second highest rolls for each side are compared, and the low roller in each loses a card (with the defender winning ties). The attack continues until one side is wiped out or the attacker voluntarily breaks off. Attackers with surviving cavalry can then make further attacks.&#10;&#10;Players gain victory points for enemy units destroyed and for having the most creatures of a particular type at the end of the third round of play.&#10;&#10;",

The haunted house is made up by randomly laying out tiles in a 6x6 square making up the floor plan and then adding entrance and exit tiles at opposing edges.&#10;&#10;Each player then gets a set of cards symbolizing different actions. Each turn consists of two phases: a random phase and planned phase. First, the random phase is where a number of random cards are drawn and executed, throwing the players off track from their plans. During the random phase, a few cards are inserted into each player's card set that cannot be chosen during the planned phase. Apart from normal move cards, there are also special action cards that may for instance move the exit or things like that. After the random phase remove the white bordered cards and perform the planned phase. Now, each player secretly select a sequence of 5 cards that define that player's actions that turn (somewhat reminiscent of RoboRally).&#10;&#10;Publisher's blurb&#10;&#10;The Haunting House is a wildly fun, fast paced, strategy boardgame with a twist. The object is simple, players enter the front door and race to be the first to reach the exit. It's not as easy as it sounds. Half the time the players choose their own path. The other half their paths are chosen randomly by opponents. Additionally, the board elements constantly change as the game progresses.&#10;&#10;The Haunting House features 38 tiles that make up the board, 60 cards and six custom-sculpted pawns.&#10;&#10;",

Inside the goal each direction has circles with numbers. A penalty must be shot to one of the free circle. To do so, the shooter has to roll the die and get one of the numbers of the intended circle to score. If a shooter has a star, the number in the star of every circle will count as well.&#10;&#10;A player in their turn will have the chance to kick a penalty at another players&acute; goal. The turn player will put a shooter card face down with the arrow pointing at the intended goal. Then the player of that goal will put a goalkeeper card face up showing their move to stop the penalty. Then, the shooter will reveal their card showing the ball direction. If the goalkeeper guesses it correctly (left, middle or right) they can put gloves chips (1, 2 or 3 gloves as their capacity) to block the circles. The shooter will indicate one of the remaining circles of that direction before rolling the die. If the goalkeeper does not guess it right, the shooter has all that direction circle options to choose. If the shooter scores it will count one goal in their scoreboard.&#10;&#10;First one scoring 5 goals will be the winner of the game.&#10;&#10;",

If the toilet is clogged the player must pick up the entire poop stack and a new toilet is started. If 3 cards of the same color are played in a row then the toilet is Flushed and that toilet is reset with zero poop cards. Some cards make players perform crazy acts on their turns.&#10;&#10;POOP: The Game is an original card game created by kids and adults for kids and adults. Kids love it because of the silly designs and opportunity to make poop jokes. Adults love it because POOP makes them act like kids.&#10;&#10;EDUCATIONAL: Younger children get a healthy dose of basic math while playing POOP. Seriously! You'll see them adding up the POOP cards to make sure they don't clog the toilet!&#10;&#10;INTERACTION: One of the funnest stages of UNO is remembering to say &quot;UNO&quot; when down to your last card. POOP takes this one step further giving players similar responsibilities throughout the entire game. If you forget and other players remind you then you have to draw another card (and take a drink if you're playing POOP as a drinking game. Speaking of...)&#10;&#10;DRINKING GAME FOR ADULTS: After getting feedback from our successful (and critically acclaimed) ZOMBIE SHUFFLE campaign, we learned that many people loved that we included drinking rules. For this reason we've made POOP an even easier drinking game. Players take drinks if they draw a card or clog the toilet and everyone drinks if the toilet is flushed.&#10;&#10;ENDLESS POSSIBILITIES: We've found at least 3 other exciting ways to play POOP using the same standard deck! You'll find the Alternate Rules PDF in the downloadable Trial Version of POOP but we are very interested in what you come up with when playing with friends and family. Experiment and send us your ideas! We'll credit you if we share it with the POOP community.&#10;&#10;",

Cashflow 101 is the first of several games created by Kiyosaki to reinforce the information in his books.&#10;&#10;The board has two tracks: A &quot;Rat Race&quot; small circle where you only roll one die to advance, and a &quot;Fast Track&quot; where you roll two dice to advance. In the Rat Race you get paid for passing your Paycheck space, and then draw from one of four decks of cards depending on which space you've landed. Some of the deals are good, others are bad. Your main problem here is a shortage of cash. In the Fast Track your main problem is an excess of cash and finding investments to sink it into before you lose it to lawsuits, divorce or tax audits.&#10;&#10;The heart of the game though are the player sheets where players learn how to fill out a financial statement. Players choose from a variety of starting careers (Truck Driver, Mechanic, Lawyer, Airline Pilot, etc.) and fill out their financial sheets appropriately. As they land cards and invest in different deals they dutifully log each change to their financial sheets as well. After a few games most people end up using the same financial sheets to fill out their own personal information.&#10;&#10;With each card event the drawing player may buy at that price, but all players may sell at that price. Also, players may make co-investments with the drawing player or even buy the deal from him if they agree. Player deals are encouraged.&#10;&#10;The game with few players is heavily biased towards real estate. With 5-6 players the cards are being drawn fast enough that the part time businesses pay off as well.&#10;&#10;There are thousands of Cashflow 101 game clubs around the world.&#10;&#10;",

Players cooperatively make decisions on how to progress the story as they decide to explore different regions of the world, follow leads, leverage allies, and overcome opposition of all kinds.

During each episode, players can earn experience points to level up their characters in between missions and unlock new options in future gameplay. Each adventure can be played separately as standalone episodes, yet should players complete all three episodes, they will unravel a master game narrative with an epic climax and unforgettable resolution with lasting impact on the future two games in the trilogy.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
