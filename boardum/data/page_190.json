The goal is to create a line of four pieces in your own color or to prevent the other player from being able to move. The winner scores one point for each empty space for making a line or one point for stalemating the opponent. Individual rounds are brief, and several rounds are usually played in a series with the overall winner being the first to reach a pre-determined number of points (such as 100).&#10;&#10;Neo-Delta is similar, except it is played on the 6x6 board, and either / both players may use the third color piece (placed by the first player on the first or second move) to form their line of four.

Each player receives a shovel card, and you place scoring cubes (worth 1-4 points) on a score card, with one cube next to each of the six types of treasure in a two-player game and two cubes each in a game with three or four players.&#10;&#10;On a turn, either you reveal the top card from the deck and place it face up on the table or you pass on revealing a card. If you reveal a card that has a rat on it while another rat is already visible, you must take one of these rat cards and add it to your collection. If you pass on revealing a card, you must choose a type of treasure and collect all cards that have this treasure on it; you may also name a treasure type after revealing a card if the rats didn't catch you.&#10;&#10;After taking one or more cards, place your shovel card on a face-up treasure card, then sit out until all players have placed their shovels, with the last player taking as many turns as desired as long as the rats stay away. You then each reclaim your shovel, while removing the covered cards from play. Continue taking turns until the deck is exhausted; if not all players have placed their shovels at this point, shuffle the removed cards and continue play until all shovels have been placed.&#10;&#10;For each treasure type (rings, coins, etc.), players count how many of these items they have on their cards, with the player who has the most (and secondmost in a game with more than two players) claiming a scoring cube for this treasure type.

Jack the Ripper mixes the interplay of party games like Werewolf and Mafia, the psychology of games like poker, and the action of games like your favorite collectible card game. On top of that, we fit all of this into a primer game that takes fifteen minutes or less to play!&#10;&#10;The Characters&#10;&#10;In Jack the Ripper, you play a character that has been attending an aristocrat's party in the year 1888. The main event of the party is a scavenger hunt and you and your group of fellow scavenger hunters are one item away from completing the hunt. The only problem is, you've been locked in a dark warehouse and one of your team mates is a celebrity known as The Whitechapel Murderer, Jack the Ripper.&#10;&#10;Strategies&#10;&#10;Players have used many strategies to get ahead in Jack the Ripper. Some have found ingenious card combinations that help them race to victory. Many have sat back quietly and watched while others are picked off one by one. A few have gotten deeply involved in questioning the other players, trying to sleuth out which one is Jack. Some industrious players have learned all of the character names and are quick to claim to be one of the other scavenger hunters, hiding the fact that they are really the Ripper himself.&#10;Jack the Ripper is mechanically easy to play and it doesn't take long to get through a game but it is dynamic enough to allow for many potential strategies in both the cards you play and the style in which you play them. So you choose, take a pot shot at one of your opponents or talk it out and then decide who to attack!&#10;&#10;The World of Jack&#10;&#10;So you are trapped in a dark warehouse and you know that one of your group members is the notorious Jack the Ripper, you just don't know which one. The closest thing you can grab to protect yourself is from the bag of scavenger hunt items that your group has collected. Using these items, the partygoers try to find out who is Jack and destroy him before he destroys all of them.&#10;If Jack can murder all of the partygoers before they murder him, Jack the Ripper wins the hunt and prowls on in infamy. If Jack falls first, then the remaining partygoers share in the victory and become the heroes of Whitechapel. But would be heroes beware, Jack has some tricks up his sleeve to help take you out.&#10;&#10;",

The unique feature of the game is that no one knows who they are &mdash; not even the lone weasel.&#10;&#10;Everyone has a card with a hidden word. All players have the exact same word except one player (the weasel). To ferret out the weasel, every player provides a clue to their word. The goal is to read all the clues, and determine which player gave a clue that does not match the others.&#10;&#10;Players earn points for correctly identifying the weasel &mdash; but weasels are clever critters, so all players must be careful when providing clues to their hidden word because if the weasel can deduce the ferrets' hidden word, the weasel will earn bonus points.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

A real head to head for the conquest of Antarctica!&#10;&#10;The battle scenario moves to the new continent with new territories and new objectives! All the adrenaline of the best known strategy game, in a single edition! On the other side of the bridge, the continent of Antarctica, divided into two territories, East Antarctica and West Antarctica, serves as an expansion of the original game. If added as the seventh continent to the southern part of the hemisphere depicted on the classic RisiKo! board, transforms the entire world conquest scenario, acting as a bridge between territories and continents so far light years away.

Expansions are underway.&#10;&#10;Players go on one of four quests, racing against each other to satisfy the victory conditions.  Each turn, a hero can move rapidly about or search the areas of the board.

    "description": "Cats have a special draw for people, but they are themselves always drawn to empty boxes and always fit in seemingly too small boxes. The internet is therefore full of &lsquo;if it fits, it sits&rsquo; images.&#10;&#10;In If It Fits players will be playing cards from their hands to create boxes for cats to sit in. Players will aim to create boxes with cat toys in them, while avoiding water sprayers. Having cat toys in your boxes will earn you points whereas water sprayers will result in penalties. By connecting boxes, players are able to take over boxes of other players unless players seal off all sides of their boxes. Sealing off boxes has the added benefit of doubling earned points in that box. However to complicate matters, a players&rsquo; cat (which claims a box) can be chased off by the black cat in the game: Princess.&#10;&#10;The moment a player has used all their cats or if the draw deck is depleted, the game ends. The score is determined and the player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;",

The entire deck is dealt out, then each player takes a hand of 8 cards from their draw pile.  There are no turns &mdash; players may do any of the following six actions, at any time and in any order: play a set or run, play a wild card, draw a card, add to or draw from a set or run, or play a draw-3 card. A set is 3 cards of one number; a run is 3 consecutive same-colored numbers. They are set down so that each player can see and reach them. When a player has got rid of all the cards in their hand, the round ends immediately. Each other player must then add points to their score for cards remaining in their hands: 5 points per number card and 10 points for each wild or draw-3 card.

    "description": "Abstract - a paint by number game&#10;&#10;Overview: You are a talented artist who specializes in abstract art. Paint/Roll your way to the next masterpiece!&#10;Players: 1 - 100+&#10;Game Time: 20 minutes&#10;Items needed: 5 six-sided dice&#10;        Optional - Markers/Crayons/Pencils of the 6 colors to make your work of art beautiful (Purple, Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange, and Red)&#10;&#10;Setup: Determine the End Goals for this game. Roll a die for each of the three end goals (A, B, C). These three goals are how to earn points from your painting, the other goals that were not rolled are ignored for this game.&#10;&#10;The game is played over 12 rounds, with players playing simultaneously, trying to earn the most points. All players will use the same dice pool for each roll, assigning however each player determines.&#10;&#10;Gameplay: Each Round you will Roll 5 dice and then use the dice to mark two numbers on your painting and also gain a bonus. From the 5 dice, two of those dice will be used to place a number on your painting, then another two dice will be used to place another number on your painting, and the 5th die will be used to gain the corresponding bonus. These markings can be done in any order.&#10;&#10;- Roll 5 dice - Roll the 5 dice. Write the numbers in the top right corner on the current round&rsquo;s track. This is just used as a helpful reference.&#10;&#10;- Use dice for painting two numbers and gaining a bonus&#10;In any order, do these three actions without using the same die more than once:&#10;&#10;Paint a number in a square - use two dice, one for the placement location and the other for the number/paint color used. &#10;    Example: You choose a die with a 1 and a die with a 3. You use the 1 for the placement location, so the number placed will need to be in one of the unused squares in the &ldquo;1&rdquo; grid. You choose the 3 as the number/paint color used in that square. You write a 3 in one of the open squares in the 1 grid.&#10;    If you there are no available squares in a die&rsquo;s location, you may not choose that.&#10;&#10;Paint a number in a square - Do this again, same as above. You must use dice that have not been used.&#10;&#10;Gain a Bonus - use a die to gain one of the three bonuses. Use a 1 or 2 to gain a &ldquo;+/- 1&rdquo; to use now or later, use a 3 or 4 to gain a &ldquo;place anywhere&rdquo; to use now or later, and use a 5 or 6 to gain a Star. Each star is worth 1 point at the end of the game and gives no other bonus.&#10;&#10;Reminder: you can do these three actions in any order. There are times when gaining the bonus first allows you to paint a more helpful square for your painting.&#10;&#10;Repeat this each round (rolling 5 dice and using those 5 dice) until 12 rounds have been completed.&#10;&#10;Important Note: If you ever cannot place one of your numbers on your painting, mark an X anywhere you choose in a square on your painting. Each X&rsquo;ed space on your painting is negative 1 point at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Using your Bonuses: You may use your bonuses at any time during the game. When you gain a bonus, circle it. When used, cross it off to show it has been used. You may spend multiple bonuses in the same round. As your painting fills up, it becomes more difficult to place your numbers. It can be especially helpful to save some bonuses to use in the last rounds of the game.&#10;&#10;Using +/- 1 Dice Bonus: When used, you may increase or decrease one of the dice numerically by one. This can be used to change a die to help with placing the die, the number/color of the die, or for gaining a bonus.&#10;&#10;Using Place Anywhere Bonus: When used, you may use one of your dice to place the number of another die anywhere. &#10;    Example: You have a 1 and a 3 for placement and number/color. All of your squares are filled in your &ldquo;1 grid&rdquo; and your &ldquo;3 grid&rdquo;. You spend a Place Anywhere bonus to change your 1 die to a Place Anywhere. You then choose to place the number/color 3 in the 5 grid, where it is advantageous for your end goals and where there is also an available square.&#10;&#10;Star Bonus: Each star is worth 1 point at the end of the game and gives no other bonus. You&rsquo;re a star!&#10;&#10;Each End Goal Explained:&#10;End Goal A: Earn points for matching shapes of the same number/color. The orientation of the shape can be mirrored and/or flipped in any way, as long as it is the same shape. You cannot use the same number twice for shapes. You can use these numbers for B and C end goals&#10;End Goal B: Earn points for each pair of these numbers anywhere on your painting. These two numbers do not need to be connected. Example: You have placed three 1&rsquo;s and five 2&rsquo;s in your painting. You have three pairs (set of 1&amp;2, 1&amp;2, and 1&amp;2), so you earn 6 points; 2 per pair.&#10;End Goal C: This goal is looking at unique numbers in either rows, columns, or grids. If you fulfill this goal in multiple rows/columns/grids, you score each time it is fulfilled.&#10;&#10;End of Game:&#10;After you have completed the 12th roll/round, total your points earned from each End Goal, one point for each Star bonus, and subtract one point for each X on your painting (unpainted squares). The player with the most points is the winner!&#10;&#10;Look at your amazing masterpiece and name it and autograph it.&#10;&#10;For those who want to take it to the next level: When marking numbers, you can use coordinating colors (color key in top left of page). After finishing, you can fill in the boxes completely with the corresponding colors to beautify your work of art.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Be the last one touching the card to claim it. When handling cards, use only your fingers. This means that you must let go of some cards at a certain point to grab another. But how can you tell if it is a bigger fish or a trap?!&#10;&#10;Players take turns drawing a card, secretly checking what's on it, placing the card anywhere they like on the table, then placing one of their fingers on it and inviting other players to do the same. As more cards are placed on the table, a player might decide to move a finger from one card to another. When only one player has a finger on a card, they claim it and discover what they've won. The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;Here's the catch: Just as some fish are bigger than others, not all cards give you the same points &mdash; and sometimes the cards turn out to be penguin's predators instead of delicious fish, costing you points instead.&#10;&#10;There are also action cards: discarding an acquired card, releasing a finger, or commanding another player to release a finger. One event card is worth +6 points, but if you happen to win the second one, they're together worth -3 points.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Trippples is played on a 8&times;8 board as opponents race from one corner to the other. On the board are placed, in a pre-movement round, tiles with three arrows which point to three of the eight surrounding spaces. Each player plays these tiles alternatively until they have all been played. Movement is made by following the arrows, and avoiding the neutral zone in the middle. The game ends when one player reaches his goal or when both players cannot make legal moves.&#10;&#10;The key game mechanism is that your move options are determined not by the three arrows on the tile under your (transparent) game piece, but by those under your opponent's piece. Thus, each move is chosen to try and limit your opponent's next as well as to try and guarantee yourself a good selection of choices. This adds an element of bluff and second-guessing to the game.&#10;&#10;The rules also include some variations to the two-player game that make the game easier or harder to finish.&#10;&#10;",

However, if you want to get the single vacancy in the company, you will have to compete to determine who is able to create the perfect frames in the best animation sequences.&#10;In Keyframes, you will have 3 rounds to prove that you deserve the vacancy. To achieve this, each one will have a hand of frames (cards) and another 5 frames will be placed in the center of the table. In each turn you must play a card from your hand, which you will reveal simultaneously to determine the turn order of the next phase. In this second phase, we will build sequences by selecting one of the available frames, among which will be those used from the players' hand to determine the turn order. But pay attention! You can only have 2 projects open at the same time on your work table, and the sequence you add must be correlative with the ones you have, moreover, you can only add it if it is the prior or subsequent frame form the one you were working on previously. If it is not possible to add it following this rule, you must close your current project to start a new one, which will penalize you in the final scoring. If you are able to make more and better sequences than your rivals, the job will be yours!&#10;Keyframes is a game created by the acclaimed Shei S. and Isra C., creators of titles such as The Red Cathedral, The White Castle, Shinkansen: Zero-Kei,1987 Channel Tunnel, Ramen... among a good handful of other great games, and illustrated by the amazing animation artist Cristina Achaui. Keyframes is a &ldquo;filler&rdquo; with very simple rules, which combines turn order bidding with a restrictive set collection which will force you, each turn, to calculate the best time to play which card, and which card to add to your sequences.&#10;&#10;A game of Keyframes takes about 15 minutes to play, and can be played with 2 or 3 people individually, or 4 with a special 2 vs. 2 team system.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Ceres: Operation Stolen Base is a Sci-Fi Solitaire board-wargame depicting the actions of an elite Rebel task force attempting to seize the largest source of water in the Solar System shortly after the outbreak of the Free Mars Revolution. Your task force must defeat the Earth Federation ships in the area and seize the primary surface base.&#10;&#10;The opposition forces are controlled by the game system using a deck of cards whereby a card is drawn after the player moves a task force, which may result in a new opposing force being placed where the task force just moved and forcing combat to occur. Some locations are more likely to have larger opposition forces to appear than others and although initial opposition forces will be relatively small, resistance will increase as their alert level increases.&#10;&#10;Players begin the game with a number of assembly points with which they can use to custom-build their fleet, including adding special weapon pods to ships to provide benefits such as drone defenses and cyber warfare abilities to keep enemy alert levels lower. If your fleet includes an assembly ship, you can even repair and alter your fleet even after your attack on Ceres begins.&#10;&#10;Four increasingly difficult missions must be completed to win the campaign game. Along the way, additional ships arrive and pods are constructed to increase strength and technological capabilities. A unique card system counts down the time remaining and provides challenges and opportunities at every orbit.&#10;&#10;In this game the player takes command of a Rebel task force attempting to complete missions critical to securing the Ceres water base. Your success will ensure Mars and other colonies have a major source of water for survival and the Earth Federation will be forced to haul water up the deep and costly gravity well from Earth.&#10;&#10;This game is set in the Free Mars universe and is a prequel to the Free Mars boxed game.&#10;&#10;Game Contents:&#10;&bull; 11 x 17&rdquo; map&#10;&bull; 40 die-cut counters&#10;&bull; 18 mini cards&#10;&bull; Scenario Instructions&#10;&bull; Four page rule booklet&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Bizzaria is a fairy tale world where anything is possible. The core is made of famous figures like the Red Riding Hood, the Wolf or perhaps a Dragon. But these figures appear in slightly different situations than usual. In addition there are many monsters in Bizzaria, which are actually the main focus of the game. How bizarre these monsters will be depends on the players...&#10;&#10;The monsters in Bizzaria are created together by players. During the game the monsters are increasingly shaped in their looks and foremost in what they say. The players use parts of cardboard faces and assemble them on a paper. Then they draw the monster around them and these papers represent the &quot;game board&quot;. Thus the &quot;game board&quot; is different and unique in each game. The cards in the game are used for the TV announcements and questions. All these clues lead the player to perceive the monsters in a certain way. In each round a special question is asked - in the form of &quot;Which of them is like this and this?&quot;. The players then look at the monsters and try to find three of them that (according to their opinion) best answer the question.&#10;&#10;After each player secretly writes down his three choices they are all revealed and scored. The game also includes expansions and specialties.&#10;&#10;The players have two essential goals. The first is to build up the character of the monsters where in each round the monsters comment on the actual course of events in a Bizzarian TV. The comments are entirely up to the players and they can range from a single interjection (Meow) to highly sophisticated expressions (If he were not a nihilist, I would not be such a therapist). The second goal is to understand the character of the monsters in light of the other players' thoughts.&#10;&#10;",

In this game, you'll play as either the Royalists or Parliamentarians, two opposing factions vying for political, economic and religious control of England. The game is based on the classic card game German Whist, but with a few twists &ndash; you'll be able to play with leaders and assets that represent key actors of the first English Civil War. With strategic play and a bit of luck, you can lead your faction to victory and secure your place in history.&#10;Taking place in the mid-17th century, the first English Civil War was a time of great political and social upheaval. The conflict pitted the supporters of King Charles I against the supporters of Parliament, who sought to limit the monarch's power and establish a more democratic government. As you play &quot;A Very Civil Whist&quot;, you'll experience the tension and drama of this critical period in English history. Will you be able to rally your troops and secure victory for your faction? Or will you fall to your opponent and be consigned to the dustbin of history? The fate of England rests in your hands!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

On the NATO side, units are divisions, corps and armies, each containing about 9,000 to 25,000 men and up to 350 or so armored fighting vehicles. The invaders' air supremacy is built into several aspects of the rules (such as the CRT) and therefore is not represented by separate aircraft unit-counters.&#10;&#10;",

All players now write down each number rolled on any state of the matching color, i.e., if the blue die shows 4 and the yellow a 2, write a 4 in one blue state and a 2 in one yellow state. If the gray die is rolled, you can place this number in a state of your choice; additionally, three times per game you can choose to use a non-gray die as any color. However, neighboring states can't have numbers with a difference larger than 1; if you can't place a number without breaking this rule, then you must place an X in a state of the appropriate color. (If all the states in an area are filled, you can ignore the die or use one of your three color changes to place the number elsewhere.)&#10;&#10;After six dice have been rolled, mark one round as being complete, then return the dice to the bag and start the next round. After a number of rounds the game ends, and whoever has the fewest Xs on their map wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Description by Andrea &ldquo;Liga&rdquo; Ligabue &amp; W. Eric Martin&#10;&#10;The Palio di Siena (known in Italy as Il Palio) is a crazy horse race that takes place twice a year in Siena on July 2 and August 16.&#10;&#10;Ten of the 17 Contrade (or city wards) are represented in the race: the seven that were left out of the previous race and a randomly chosen three from the remaining ten Contrade. Each Contrade has particular colors and coats of arms, and the horse and rider are dressed to embody their Contrade. Riders can use their whips on other horses and riders as well as on their own mount, and the winner is the first horse to cross the finish line with its head ornaments in place &ndash; whether or not the rider is still on the horse.&#10;&#10;New Italian game designer Massimo Pesce, together with the help of Scribabs&rsquo; Paolo Vallerga as art director, has produced a nice and simple game about this race. The players control the seventeen Contrade involved in the two races, with ten Contrade taking part in the first race (Palio di Provenzano) and a different set of ten in the second one (Palio dell&rsquo;Assunta). This set-up means that one or more players might hold Contrade involved with only one race.&#10;&#10;Each Contrade is assigned a horse (&quot;la tratta&quot;) that can be either a good one (&quot;bono,&quot; with a movement die of 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6) or a not-so-good one (&quot;brenna,&quot; with movement of 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6). Since the race lasts for three laps, that small difference can add up over time. In addition to the decorative jockey, players receive nine cards that can be used during the race to create small advantages or slow down opponents.&#10;&#10;As for the race itself, like the real Palio, the beginning is somewhat chaotic as horses and riders jockey for position. During the movement phase, if a horse can&rsquo;t move its entire distance, it risks falling or perhaps just throwing the rider, which doesn&rsquo;t prevent a horse from winning. The game is all about playing the right cards at the right moment and getting the right rolls.&#10;&#10;Palio is simple and quick, the materials are good, and the graphics is great !&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "This game is divided into two sub-games.  The first part has players laying out street/business tiles.  Each tile has one business on it and a colored chip corresponding to the player who placed it.  Once the board is filled, play moves to the next stage.  Each player has a pawn next to the fountain at the center of the board.  The object is to visit each of the businesses that you laid out in the first phase.  Each successive business you visit gives you more movement points, but the real goal of the game is to score the most points.  Points are scored by forgoing remaining movement when you arrive at your businesses.  In addition to a scoring pawn, players are each given a police token which can be used to hamper other players' movements.  Players who have completed their circuit wait at the fountain until all players have finished, but finishing quickly gives you a point bonus for each turn you wait.&#10;&#10;",

In each game, two special scoring cards are drawn from a deck that allow players to gain bonus points by meeting certain conditions.&#10;&#10;In the building rounds, the players summon their specialized characters onto the game board and employ them (using Action Points) to construct valuable structures such as Walls, Houses, Battlements, Towers, Palaces, Fountains, and Pastures. These are built from their supplies of colored building blocks. In addition to expanding their own kingdoms, the players can use their forces to hinder the progress of their rivals.&#10;&#10;In the crowning round, the players display their completed kingdoms and flaunt their power over the realm. The player with the most Victory Points at the end of the game is the winner!&#10;&#10;Character Classes:&#10;&#10;Kings summon the other characters to the board from the supply.&#10;Villagers are needed to build Houses (which can be converted into Towers and Palaces).&#10;Artisans are necessary to complete the building of advanced structures.&#10;Horses assist the other characters in their movements on the board.&#10;Thieves can climb on Walls, and can steal Action Points from their rivals.&#10;Knights can attack opponents' characters. &#10;Warlocks can use their Mana to cast spells (which are different in each game).&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "June 1940-December 1943, Mediterranean Sea&#10;&#10;Standing alone, the British Empire must replenish its strategic bases in Malta and Alexandria by convoys coming for the most part from Gibraltar. Each journey is long and dangerous facing Italian SM-84 torpedo planes and German U-boats. On the other side, Italy and Germany are sending more and more troops to North Africa under constant threat from aircraft in Malta and facing the imminent entry of the United States into the war.&#10;&#10;In this original card game, the cards represent units that took part in naval engagements or fought near convoys in the Mediterranean during the Second World War. For each trick called engagement, a player takes an Operation card (Battle or Convoy) and declares the type of attack to be used (air, surface, underwater or combined). He follows that up by playing a Force card which has the specific values representing a historical Allied or Axis unit. The other players subsequently play either a Force card or pass. When all the players have made their selections, and any possible dice rolls have been made, totals of both sides are compared to determine whether the Axis or the Allies won. The player who contributed the most to the winning team gets to decide how the convoy and the opposing enemy ships, which are all worth victory points and possibly an increased hand size, are to be distributed amongst the players who were on the winning side. After twenty-two convoys have been fought over in this manner, the player with the most victory points worth of convoys and captured ships wins the game!&#10;&#10;Med Sirocco is a strategy card game for 2-6 players. The game uses the same system that first appeared in the popular (and out of print) 1997 Avalon Hill card game Atlantic Storm and Pacific Typhoon published in 2008 by GMT Games.&#10;&#10;",

All players start the game on Saffron Island and may sail in any direction from there. Progress through the game is denoted by three progress stages. Each progress stage brings with it new explorations, more valuable resources, and more formidable pirates. The experience and wealth accumulated throughout the game is represented by prestige points. At the end of the game, the player with the most prestige points wins.&#10;&#10;In more detail, each player's turn consists of two phases. At the end of these two phases, the next player to the left begins their turn. These two phases are:&#10;&#10;1) Movement Phase, during which players can choose to explore, sail, or drop anchor.&#10;&#10;2) Action Phase &mdash; If there is no pirate ship on the player's tile, the player can take one of the following actions from their current ocean tile location: explore, sell and buy trading goods, resupply, work at port, or fish.&#10;&#10;The game's ending is initiated when one of the final achievement ocean tiles is revealed in the final stage.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "From inside box cover:&#10;&#10;&quot;How to play Michigan Rummy&quot;&#10;&#10;NUMBER OF PLAYERS: Two to nine players may play &quot;Michigan Rummy&quot;.&#10;&#10;EQUIPMENT: Michigan Rummy three-dimensional revolving playing board, a regular deck of cards, and chips or counters.  The Michigan Rummy board consists of nine sections.  WINNING PAY CARDS are indicated next to each section on the board.  The round center section is the Michigan Rummy Pot.&#10;&#10;HOW TO PLAY:&#10;(1) THE DEAL.  The deal is determined by cutting the cards, high card winning the deal.  Players then place one chip in each of the3 nine sections of the plastic tray, except the dealer who places two chips in each section.  The dealer shuffles the cards and deals all of them out, one card at a time to each player, to the left.  One extra, or dummy hand, is dealt in front of the dealer.  It does not matter if some players receive one more card than others.&#10;&#10;(2) THE PLAY.&#10;(a) The dealer picks up either one of the two hands before him.  The dealer may, after looking at his hand, have the option of exchanging his hand for the dummy hand (but without looking at the dummy hand) or selling the dummy hand to the player making the highest bid for it.  Any player (including dealer) cannot exchange his hand for the dummy hand if he holds a PAY CARD.  The exchange of hands must be made complete.  Player cannot retain any of the cards in his original hand.  The amount of chips bid for the dummy hand go to the dealer and the player making the bid then exchanges his own hand for the dummy hand.  The extra hand is then put aside.&#10;&#10;(b) POKER. Before beginning the actual play of MICHIGAN RUMMY a hand of poker is played for the chips in the poker pool section.  Each player forms their best poker hand with five cards from his hand.  The remainder of their hands are kept face down in front of them for later use. The dealer starts the betting and can bet, or pass, the other players doing likewise.  The bets and raises are placed in the poker pool section, and the winning hand receives all these chips.&#10;&#10;(c) MICHIGAN RUMMY. The players take up all their cards and the dealer starts by playing the lowest card of any suit in his hand he wishes (Ace is high, duece is low).  He MUST play the lowest card of the suit he chooses.  He calls out the card and places it in front of him.  The player who holds the next higher consecutive card in the same suit plays it, placing it in front of him and calling out its name, etc., and this continues until the Ace of the suit is played, or a STOP is reached (due to the dummy hand holding the next high card).  The player who played an ACE or STOP card reopens with the lowest card in his hand in ANOTHER suit and play continues accordingly.  If a player cannot reopen with a card of another suit after a STOP, play ends there and there is no payment for the deal.  Any player who plays a PAY CARD takes all the chips from the corresponding section of the playing board (i.e. if you play the King of Clubs you collect all the chips in the King of Clubs section).  In order to collect for some PAY CARDS, they must be played in sequence by the same player (i.e. Queen of Hearts, King of Hearts, and 7, 8, and 9 of any suit).  The first player to discard all his cards wins all the chips in the Michigan Rummy Pot (round center section).  A variation may be played by having the winner collect one chip from each of the other players for every card remaining in that player's hand, in addition to the Michigan Rummy Pot.  The game is then over and the deal goes to the left for the next game.&#10;&#10;The players again place a chip in each of the nine sections (the dealer placing two chips in each section) even though some chips may still remain from previous play.&#10;&#10;After the final game of play, it may be found that chips remain in several sections of the playing board.  If this is the case, all of these chips may be placed in the POKER POOL section and a &quot;showdown&quot; hand of poker may be played.  Five cards are dealt face up to each player and the player with the best POKER HAND wins all the remaining chips on the board.  If players are not familiar with hand values in poker, below is listed, in order, winning combinations:&#10;(1) Straight Flush (3-4-5-6-7) or any other sequence of five cards all one suit.&#10;(2) Four of a kind.&#10;(3) Full house (three of a kind and one pair).&#10;(4) Flush--all one suit, but not in sequence.&#10;(5) Straight--(3-4-5-6-7) or any other sequence of different suits.&#10;(6) Three of a kind.&#10;(7) Two pairs.&#10;(8) One pair.&#10;&#10;Also see:&#10;&#10;    Tripoley&#10;&#10;&#10;",

If a player cannot move the required number of spaces on his turn, he picks up his token and places it on any space he wishes.)&#10;&#10;Whenever a newly placed tile shows a bandit on it, the bandit figure moves one space closer to the cave entrance.

Players compete head-to-head to destroy each other's fleets and space station; the last player or team standing is the victor.&#10;&#10; Gameplay:&#10;&#10;Players choose from a variety of pre-constructed decks or can assemble their own, then each player takes turns either building up their base or building ships to attack their opponents. First player to destroy (or take over from boarding action) is the winner.&#10;&#10;Each faction/deck has a unique power and varied amounts of resources generated each turn. With these resources you can add on modules to your base, or play ships/marines to the table. Your base functions as a mothership where your subsequent ships make up the fleet you will use for offense and defense. Each turn you will get more resources based on your base and the modules attached (which can add to your resource generation).&#10;&#10;The ships and marines have different special abilities such as stealth (to avoid enemy detection). Some ships can even retrieve more ships from your deck at no cost.&#10;&#10;Combat is resolved with d10s. You count up the total amount your roll for offense (based on the current stats of the cards involved) then roll. The target roll is determined by the defense of the ship. Most small ships can only take 1 or 2 hits, but larger ships will need multiple hits to take down. Wounds do carry over but there are mechanisms to remove some wound tokens over time.&#10;&#10;",

The results of these battles profoundly changed the course of English history and language. At Stamford Bridge, the Viking invasion of England was repulsed by the Anglo-Saxon army, while three weeks later, at Senlac Hill, the Norman invaders successfully defeated the Anglo-Saxon army and were able to conquer the whole of England. The outcome of the Battle of Senlac Hill was a direct result of the Battle of Stamford Bridge. In a campaign game, players play the Battle of Stamford Bridge first. Then the Battle of Senlac Hill is played with an order of battle determined by the outcome of the Battle of Stamford Bridge. Either game may be played independently of the other.&#10;&#10;1066 uses a revolutionary innovation in wargaming entitled the MOVEMENT RESOLUTION SYSTEM. There is no die to throw nor any card to choose. The result of an attack depends entirely upon how intelligently you move, not the luck of the die. The MOVEMENT RESOLUTION SYSTEM consists of the attacker moving adjacent to an enemy unit, then both players moving one hex simultaneously. The result of this move determines the result of the attack.&#10;&#10;",

The tactical aspects of the game come through the addition of the arena, a 5x6 board where the core of the game takes place on. You and your summons get to move around the arena each turn, and you may cast spells or attack your enemies based on the distance and the direction you are facing. Also, with alteration cards, players can actually change spots in the arena into walls, holes, or buildings.&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Hackers representing different networks would be gathered and sealed off from the rest of the internet, and try to hack into each other&rsquo;s machines.&#10;&#10;Players are leading a team of such hackers, balancing the various needs of Attack, Defense, Install and Mitigation to score well in the arena. Will you focus your limited time &amp; efforts on hacking the other teams? Or will you try to mount an impregnable firewall? Don&rsquo;t forget to keep your servers online &amp; healthy to generate the most points out of them!&#10;&#10;Gameplay Overview:&#10;    The game consists of 3 rounds, and each player can take up to 5 actions each round. Players have a set of action tiles to simultaneous choose &amp; resolve actions in the following order: &#10;    1. Install - Pay cards to buy Servers Cards to generate VP when the round ends.&#10;    2. Defense - Play Defense Cards to fend attacks and gain card effects.&#10;    3. Attack - Play Attack Cards to hack other player's servers and score VP immediately. &#10;    4. Mitigation - Pay cards to repair damage dealt your servers.&#10;    At the end of the round, players score VP depending on the health of their servers. Then they remove all damage tokens from their servers, discard their hand and draw 8 new cards for the next round. &#10;    Player with most VP at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Stalingrad Solitaire is a solitaire game simulating the last weeks of the  encircled German 6th Army in the pocket German troops nicknamed &ldquo;The  Cauldron&rdquo; that formed in and to the west of the city of Stalingrad when Soviet troops broke through the Wehrmacht&rsquo;s front lines in December  1942.&#10;&#10;You represent 6th Army&rsquo;s commander, General Paulus. All actions  of the Soviet commander Zhukov and subordinate units are strictly  controlled by the game rules. As Paulus, your goal is to save the trapped army in the Cauldron while at the same time cooperating  with the high command (OKW) to preserve the integrity of the entire  southern front in Russia. Each turn you perform various types of actions  within the pocket. Die rolls and rules determine the strategic  situation and strategy employed by Army Group South outside the pocket,  specifically in terms of the commitment levels of the Luftwaffe (air  force) and General Hoth's relief force.&#10;&#10;Each turn represents one to five days, depending on the  level of activity. The entire board represents territory  approximately 35 by 65 miles. German units typically represent  divisions, while Soviet units are officially armies that were usually  the rough equivalent of a German division. Each supply point represents about 50 tons delivered per day. Each evacuated wounded factor represents 1500 men.&#10;&#10;This war game is big in scope (and lettering) and can be  played in a (long) evening. Rather than standard 9/16&quot; or even 5/8&quot; inch  counters, this  game utilizes our custom 3/4&quot; square counter die to create large, thick  counters that are easy to see and manipulate. The base game  also  contains a map with easy ergonomics, and a well tested game system that  approaches its subject with enough abstraction to keep  the game tight,  but enough detail to do justice to history and create an array of  complex decisions.&#10;&#10;The map represents the city of Stalingrad and surrounding area and contains 64 areas for regulating movement and combat. Each area is linked to every other area it is connected to by a line.&#10;&#10;The player controls all vacant areas inside the German Perimeter marked on the map. The player also controls all areas containing German units, regardless of their location. Any vacant area outside the Perimeter or occupied by a Soviet unit are under Soviet control. No area may contain units from both sides.&#10;&#10;Game counters represent combat units and information markers. German units are blue, their Rumanian allies are yellow, Soviet units are red, and information markers are white. The number of counters provided in the game is deliberately limited.&#10;&#10;Cards are used to determine outcomes for weather, offensives, as well as individual attacks, and provide random changes to the game state as well as randomised situations.&#10;&#10;",

The game board shows a top-down view of the temple, showing a path through the temple off which are many niches holding the treasures. The pathway has stepping stones marked with a variety of symbols, one in front of each. To open the niche you must have the right symbol. To move around, you must spend footprint tiles. To obtain these, the player must reveal 2 supply tiles, keeps one and auctions the other. Players bid with anything they have, tiles, coins, cards.&#10;&#10;Sounds confusing? It is. You must win auctions to get the stuff you need to win more auctions and move and open niches and collect treasures to score points to win the game.  It might take a player a while to figure the true value of all of the items and how it all fits together, but once a player has the idea, the game really works.&#10;&#10;",
