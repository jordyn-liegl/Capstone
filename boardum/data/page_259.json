There are 4 different sets: The Baudelaire Orphans, Count Olaf in Disguise, Olaf's Henchmen and the Orphans Confidants. Players take turns drawing a card from either the draw pile or the top card from the discard pile in hopes of completing their sets.&#10;&#10;Aside from Character Cards, there are special cards that augment play:&#10;&#10;Olaf's Eye - lets you see another players hand.&#10;&#10;Burning House - Lets you destroy a set of another player&#10;&#10;Mr. Poe - Forces another player to make another set&#10;&#10;Lemony Snicket - Disables ALL other special cards&#10;&#10;Beatrice - acts as a wild card in completing your sets&#10;&#10;First player to complete their sets wins the hand and may retrieve a victory card from either the center or from an opponent. The game ends when there are no more victory cards left in the center.&#10;&#10;From the box:&#10;&#10;Rescue the Baudelaire orphans by building sets of characters that include Uncle Monty, the Hook-Handed Man and Count Olaf!&#10;&#10;From the rules:&#10;&#10;Sadly the Object of this game is not to have a pleasant experience, for any game involving the Baudelaire Orphans will surely end in disappointment. However should one choose to play anyway, his or her objective is to be the first player to collect a majority of seven victory cards. One victory card is awarded to the winner of each round.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Have you ever needed to crack a code, say to a new phone you bought second hand? If so (or even if you&rsquo;ve just seen all that goes into it from movies like Mission Impossible and The Da Vinci Code), then you know how incredibly important&mdash;and difficult&mdash;it can be.&#10;&#10;Welcome to Cracked, the fast and furious strategic card game for 2-8 players. In Cracked, players race to be the first to end the game by having four cards in their hand that matches their unique code card. Sound simple? It is. Yet&hellip;it&rsquo;s not. In fact, Cracked was designed to be welcoming to beginning gamers, but still competitive and tactical enough for the more serious gamer in your life.&#10;&#10;To play, players take turns playing one or more cards from their hand in order to match the color or number value on the central card (i.e. the card in the middle of the table). If the central card is a green 6, then you could play a green card, a 6 card, or two cards equaling 6 (i.e. a 5 and a 1). Action cards spice things up a notch, as they can swap hands, force a player to miss a turn, and more. Collect the numbers required by your code card&mdash;and discard anything that doesn&rsquo;t match&mdash;and you win!&#10;&#10;With a fast playtime and high player count, Cracked can be brought out for nearly any social situation. This 2-8 player strategic card game is filled with innovative and unique game mechanics that make every game tense and exciting, perfect for any occasion. The game was designed to be casual and streamlined enough to welcome beginning gamers, but tactical enough to keep the hard-core players challenged. A fine balance between the two will introduce a new gaming experience that has not been felt in this genre of gaming for a while. Do you have what it takes to crack the code and emerge as the best code-cracker around?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

This is done until each player has placed 5 tiles. This makes up the playing board.&#10;&#10;Each player then receives 8 cards from the card deck. Cards come in 4 flavors. World cards, which are not shuffled into the deck, have info about each world tile. The player who owns that tile takes the card for reference. Character cards have a base strength, class and a home world indicator. They can be played to a tile that you own as defense against attack. If they are played to their home world their strength is doubled. Scroll cards can be placed on worlds and used by characters that can wield magic. These cards boost the base strength. Artifact cards can be used by any character. They boost strength and sometimes have special powers.&#10;&#10;Each player picks a world tile to be his home and places 5 of their 8 cards there to defend it. Players also have a pawn that represents their army.&#10;&#10;During a turn a player first draws 3 cards from the deck.&#10;&#10;Second a player may play up to 2 cards. These cards can be played from his hand to a controlled world, from a controlled world to another controlled world or from a controlled world to his hand.&#10;&#10;Third a player may move his pawn 1 or 2 worlds. If he enters a world controlled by another player he must stop.&#10;&#10;Although not stated in the rules I would assume if a pawn is in a world not claimed by another player he could claim the world and play cards there. If a pawn is in a world occupied by another player you would then have a battle. A battle is fought between the cards on the tile as defense and the cards from the attacking players hand. Calls from allies can be made and other players can contribute to the battles as well.&#10;&#10;The first player to control 8 worlds wins.&#10;&#10;",

Coinciding with the final book in the trilogy being released this fall, the Training Days game allows 2-6 players to follow in the footsteps of their favorite Tributes.&#10;&#10;User review: Each player chooses a district to represent and a gender. The players take the appropriate Tribute Card. Each Tribute Card gives the players ratings from one (low) to eight (high) in four attributes: strength, ability, cunning, and charm. The Challenge deck is shuffled and a player is chosen to go first. The players will take their turns in clockwise order.&#10;&#10;The first player reveals a number of Challenge cards equal to the number of players. Each player has three effort tokens: one (low), three (medium), and six (high). Each player, in turn, will assign one effort token face down to any Challenge card. After all the players have assigned their effort tokens, the events on the Challenge cards are resolved. One Challenge card at a time, the effort tokens are revealed and the winner of the event is determined. Each player total one&rsquo;s own Effort tokens plus the Attribute rating called for by the card, plus alliance bonuses (from Tribute cards not already in play) plus a die roll. The player with the highest total wins the event and the approval rating associated with the event.&#10;&#10;Three End of Day cards were shuffled into the Event deck at the beginning of the game. When ever an End of Day card is revealed, then all the event cards are shuffled with the End of Days cards. Before the game began the players determine how many days the will last. When that number of End of Day cards has been revealed, then the game is over and the player who has the highest approval rating is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

One is based on reflexes, the other one on memory. In the first variant there are 3 different pizzas on the table. Each pizza shows different ingredients on it. The ingredient tiles are placed face down on the table and flipped face up one by one by each player. When the players flip face up the whole set of ingredients for one of the pizza they have smash this pizza with a hand. Whoever touch it first, gains it as a point. The player who scores 3 points is the winner.&#10;&#10;In the second variant the ingredient tiles are also put face down on the table, but each player has his own pizza. Now each player can filp ingredient tile face up one after another as long as the ingredients match to those in his pizza. When he encounters wrong ingredient, he has to flip all the face up tiles face down, and the next player proceeds. When one of the players finds all the ingredients he need, he wins this round. The first player to win 3 rounds is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

The object of the game is to arrive in Anchorage with the most money, which is found through panning for gold, visiting gold mines, and other events along the way. Hazards that players encounter during game play duplicate some of the real-life problems motorists may face driving to Alaska's largest city, such as icy roads, landslides, bears, and everybody's favorite, a boarded-up gas station in the middle of nowhere. &#10;Solid production values here, with some colorful cartoon-style graphics on the Encounter Cards and game board. There's a prospector's &quot;poke&quot; containing some exquisite pewter playing pieces (a la &quot;Monopoly&quot;) that include a moose, a jeep, a bush plane, and a dog sled, among others. The game has plenty of &quot;Yukon Sam Bucks&quot; provided in various denominations, along with a handy storage tray, and is topped off with a pair of substantial dice and a &quot;Rainbow Road/Pan For Gold&quot; spinner.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "From Amigo: Be the fastest one to get the right lucky charm! But which lucky charm is the right one: mushroom, pig or chimney sweep? Your personal lucky number will tell you. You need luck and talent to gather the most cards of all players.&#10;&#10;START OF PLAY&#10;Three target cards are placed in the middle of the table. Each player must be able to reach them well with both his hands. The remaining 63 cards (symbol and touch cards) are shuffled and this deck is placed face down on the table. One player is chosen to be the starting player.&#10;&#10;The Lucky Number&#10;Now each player receives one or more lucky numbers. The starting player places the face down deck in front of him on the table. He reveals the topmost card in such a way that everyone can see it at the same time. The revealed card is either a symbol or a touch card.&#10;&#10;A symbol card shows one to eight small &quot;lucky mushrooms&quot; (blue), &quot;lucky pigs&quot; (yellow) and chimney sweeps (red) in different combinations and in the color of the target cards. When a symbol card is revealed, each player has to find out, how often a symbol is found on the symbol card. If the number of one symbol equals the lucky number of a player he tries to draw the appropriate target card as quickly as possible towards him.&#10;&#10;For each target card a player has successfully drawn he receives a card from the deck. These cards are placed in front of the player. If a player draws (touching counts as drawing) a card, which he was not allowed to draw (e.g. because he miscounted the symbols) he has to put three of his own cards in the jackpot, for each card he has drawn wrongly. If he has less than three cards, all of them have to go into the jackpot.&#10;&#10;The jackpot is a collection of cards (maximum five). It is placed near the target cards. If there are at any time more than five cards in the jackpot, the surplus cards are shuffled back into the deck before revealing the topmost card. At the start of play there is no jackpot.&#10;&#10;After the first player has given a card from the deck to each player who has correctly drawn a target card, the target cards are placed back in the middle of the table. The revealed card is placed in the jackpot as are all the cards the players have lost.&#10;&#10;If a touch card is revealed, quick reactions are called for. Each player tries to touch the matching target card with both his hands, placing one after the other. This will create a huge pile of hands, sometimes in wildly mixed order. The target card remains in the middle of the table. A touch card shows a big &quot;lucky mushroom&quot;, a big &quot;lucky pig&quot; or a big &quot;chimney sweep&quot;.&#10;&#10;Whoever is the first to have only one hand of another player between his two hands (e.g. there are not two or more hands between his two hands (the sandwich)) receives the revealed touch card and the jackpot.&#10;&#10;After the starting player has given the touch card and the jackpot to the winner, this round is finished.&#10;&#10;If there are not enough cards in the deck to give to all players the cards they won, The game ends immediately. The player with the most cards wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

These can be played on your turn instead of flipping an allergy card to effect the course of the game (e.g. you hold your breath to avoid sneezing, or play a 'mean trick' to double the effect of one of the cards than an opponent is allergic to).&#10;&#10;When a player with four allergies sneezes they are out--at that point the game switches to 'sudden death' with any player who sneezes being eliminated.&#10;&#10;This is clearly a kids game, but with a few twists of strategy to keep everybody interested, especially around management of 'And Now' cards, and preparing for the switch into the sudden death end game.&#10;&#10;",

You place your chosen playing piece on the board (you can start anywhere) and move the number you spin with the arrow in the centre of the board.  Each time you land on a coloured square you collect two more brand cards of that colour, or one if the board instructs you. Once you have three or more of a coloured brand you can announce a launch of your company. The person to your right shuffles the risky business cards, turning the cards over one at a time, so you can judge how much you will risk without getting a BUST! card. You then multiply the money by the number of brand cards you launched with. No takeover or newsflash cards are used.&#10;&#10;Executive Rules&#10;&#10;Add in the newsflash cards for a chance, which could be good or bad (named brands will change in value), and you have a game with a greater element of risk. These rules differ as you now have the chance when you land on the takeover spots on the board to pick up a takeover disc. The next time one of your competitors launches a company you can attempt a takeover. Adding the total of your brand cards, plus any additional 'on the up' brands, plus a spin of the central spinner. If you beat the opponent you win all their cards but be careful if you lose they launch their company with more brands and therefore can earn more money.&#10;&#10;",

But, before qualifying top of your class, you have to prepare your ultimate magic spell. You need three rare treasures from the Kingdom of Calandria: a tear from the Water Nymph, a tooth from the Fire Dragon and an emerald from the Rock Giant. But these mythical creatures won&rsquo;t give up their treasure without a fight! As a student of magic, you will need to show what you&rsquo;ve learned at Isidore. You will need to trade ingredients, compose spells to control the elements of Rock, Water and Fire, and ultimately win the duels!&#10;&#10;In Isidore, you can collect, buy or trade ingredients throughout the Kingdom of Calandria. You need these ingredients to make your Rock, Water and Fire spells. The top spell card of the stack shows which ingredients you need to make the spell. If you&rsquo;re at Isidore and you have all the ingredients needed for a Rock, Water or Fire spell, you can take a spell card.&#10;&#10;With these spells you can challenge the magical creatures to a duel. The magical creatures are powerful and always have three different duel cards (Rock, Water and Fire) to counter your attack. The player to the left of the attacking student stands in to play on behalf of the magical creature and takes the three dark duel cards.&#10;&#10;As in the &lsquo;Rock-Paper-Scissors&rsquo; game, the student and the magical creature choose one of their spell cards (duel cards), which they place on the table &ndash; at exactly the same time - after reciting the magical spell I-SI-DORE (as in  one, two, three!).&#10;&#10;&bull;    Fire beats Rock (fire melts rock).&#10;&bull;    Rock beats Water (rock absorbs water).&#10;&bull;    Water beats Fire (water puts out fire).&#10;&bull;    If the student and the magical creature play the same spell card, the elements cancel one another out and no one wins the round.&#10;&#10;The first student to collect three treasures can return to school, where they will be awarded a diploma from the Isidore Academy of Magical Arts. This student also wins the game!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Ever present journalists can also be an irritating nuisance.&#10;&#10;A stack of cards, representing a large crowd of people, is spread on the table. All players simultaneously race to find the types of cards that agree with their chosen politician. Some cards, however, cause your character stress. When you pass a certain threshold beyond which you cannot keep your cool (8 stress points), you stop searching through cards to yell &quot;Casse-toi pauvre con!&quot; and then the round ends. You track your popularity points on the score track. Whoever is the most popular at the end of the game will win the election!&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "PACIFIC WAR CLASSICS VOLUME 1: The Island Battles of Tarawa and Saipan consists of two games in one package. The battles at Tarawa and Saipan are depicted on separate game maps and use two separate game systems. Although the Fresno Gaming Association was probably guilty of plagiarism in some of their game designs, their graphic presentation was always first class and this game is no exception.&#10;&#10;The Island Battle of Saipan uses the system that FGA previously used in their OPERATION CRUSADER game. This is basically a traditional Ugo - Igo system. On the Saipan map, each hex is 1.8 miles across and a Game Turn equals one day of actual time.&#10;&#10;The Island Battle of Tarawa is a tactical-level game covering the invasion of Betio Island, part of the Tarawa atoll. This is a two map introductory level game using a game system called STS (Simple Tactical System) that Fresno Gaming Association claimed as their own. The STS is a pseudo-simultaneous-movement system. First one player moves a stack, or performs combat with a stack, and then his opponent does the same. The first player then repeats this with another stack, etc. The Game Turn continues according to the Sequence of Play until chance ends the Turn. That is determined by combat die rolls. Each hex on the Tarawa map represents 35 yards from hexside to opposite hexside and a Game Turn represents 2 hours.&#10;&#10;9&quot; x 12&quot; x 2&quot; bookcase style game box; &#10;16-page (8?&quot; x 11&quot;) Rules booklet; &#10;two 22&quot; x 34&quot; unmounted game maps; &#10;17&quot; x 22&quot; unmounted game map; &#10;960 die-cut, back-printed, unpunched, cardboard counters; &#10;five card-stock Player Aids; and &#10;a 10-sided die.&#10;&#10;",

Players attempt to steal treasures from each other or the vault by using one of their five number cards. These cards are numbered four through eight. When played they define the odds of success during your attempt to steal a treasure. The defending player sets the combination of the lock to his or her vault by placing a card face down that is from 1 to the number the attacking player has played. Using the right cards with the right treasure effects could ensure your victory. Pick the Lock combines a nice blend of strategy, wit, and luck.

The first player to find and secure his treasure wins the game.&#10;&#10;The pyramid, which is about to be explored, is built with the help of cards. All of these cards are placed face down in a 6x6 grid. Around half of the grid is built by light cards which cannot hide jars or treasures, the other half consists of darker tiles and are placed deeper inside the pyramid. Every player can spend 5 movement points. It costs 2 movement points to move through an undiscovered tile, but only one movement point to walk across a discovered tile. Players are not allowed to move diagonally and must always show their opponents the way they wish to take. Although moving through discovered tiles is faster, it can also be less handy and dangerous as you might not only discover a simple corridor but also a trap. Cards are used to move, look at undiscovered tiles or attack your opponents.&#10;&#10;As soon as the first player discovers a canopic jar, the mummy awakes and starts to wander the pyramid. The mummy is moved by the different players and can be used to prevent an archaelogist from leaving the pyramid with a valuable artefact. When the mummy attacks, all items the attacked player has in his backpack are lost and returned to the pyramid.&#10;&#10;If a player successfully leaves the pyramid with a jar, the card is taken out of the game and cannot be taken away from the player again. To prevent players from securing their treasures, other players can steal items or attack opponents to make them lose an object.&#10;&#10;From the back of the game box:&#10;You are on the verge of meeting the greatest challenge an archaelogists could ever be faced with:&#10;Krimsutep's Pyramid&#10;Legendary treasures are said to be hidden inside the pyramid, but be careful. Legends speak of a curse that will be put on anybody who dares to enter the pyramid and tries to reveal its secrets. Not only does the structure of the pyramid pose a problem to eager archaelogists, but also the pharao himself does not wish to be disturbed. &#10;Who will be the first to find the legendary treasures of Krimsutep and get them to safety?&#10;&#10;",

On a turn, a player takes one of the two cards in hand, places it facedown on the table, then takes an action &mdash; from feeding the dog, sharing with another player, tattling on someone, or actually eating a beet &mdash; and the other players decide whether to allow the action or call the player on it. If the player is called out, they take the action only if they have the proper card in hand and the tattletale gets punished with an extra beet.&#10;&#10;",

A player's turn ends when she can play no more cards, possibly because she has emptied her hand! Two special cards are available with five copies of each; one forces opponents to take cards from the top of a stack and place them in their personal deck, and the other allows a player to play one or more cards at the top of the stack instead of the bottom.&#10;&#10;Instead of playing cards on a turn, a player can return any number of cards from her hand to the bottom of her deck, then draw that many cards.&#10;&#10;The first player to get rid of all cards in her deck and her hand wins!&#10;&#10;Two variants are included in the rules. First, players play four rounds, and after each round all players score negative points for the number of cards left in their decks and hands, while the player who went out scores three positive points.

Movement is handled through rounds of card play during which cards are played and then reacted to in order to eliminate all the cards in your hand.  Dinosaur cards have values ranging from 1-5 while Escape cards have values ranging from +1 to +3.  In order to play a Dinosaur atop another Dinosaur, it must be greater in value than the preceding card.  Escape cards may be played on any Dinosaur and these also allow you to play an additional Dinosaur card.&#10;&#10;Once someone has gone out, movement on the board (of players and the Spinosaurus) is based upon the last played card.&#10;&#10;If the Spinosaurus lands on your pawn, you are knocked back (not eliminated).&#10;&#10;First pawn/player to reach the Final Escape space wins.&#10;&#10;",

Each of the illustrations differs from the others in only a minor detail or change of position, so that players are required to scrutinize them closely in order to match tiles and the pictures on the boards correctly.&#10;&#10;Differix was developed by psychologists and promoted by Ravensburger as a way to develop observation, concentration, and pattern recognition skills in young children.
