    "description": "By February 1814, Wellington had invested the French city of Bayonne and was pressing into the French interior with two goals in mind: driving the French army away from the important port city of Bordeaux, and bringing Soult's army to bay. Soult's Army of the Pyrenees, outnumbered and outclassed by Wellington's veteran forces, fell back towards the east, defending a series of river lines. Wellington's troops, showing excellent coordination between their maneuvering wings, were able to turn Soult out of these strong defensive positions one by one, all the while driving toward the inland city of Toulouse.&#10;&#10;On February 26, Wellington's lead elements were able to exploit a gap in the French cavalry screen and began crossing the Gave de Pau River unopposed, moving in the direction of Orthez. Soult chose not to fall back, and arrayed his six divisions in excellent defensive positions on the high ground north and west of the town. On February 27, he would be attacked by Wellington's eight divisions.&#10;&#10;Orthez focuses on the infantry game, and as such serves as an excellent introduction to the system. Artillery plays a supporting role, and there are only a half dozen or so cavalry regiments per side. For the first time we see Wellington and the British on the attack. Command control plays a critical role, and highlights the differences between Wellington's veteran and well-established command hierarchy and Soult's more makeshift organization. British advantages include numerical superiority, command flexibility and their excellent infantry. The main French advantage is the terrific defensive terrain and the defense of interior lines. Make no mistake though, this is a very tough battle for the French.&#10;&#10;In addition to the main battle scenario, there are several smaller scenarios that can be played to conclusion in a long evening. A variety of optional rules are included to provide replayability and variability for face to face or solitaire play.&#10;&#10;La Bataille D'Orthez will feature two hand drawn maps of the battlefield by Rick Barber, as well as 420 state of the art counters and the usual assortment of charts and tables. The rules will be contained in a single book, and will be based on those included in La Bataille de Lutzen.&#10;&#10;scale = 100 m/hex; &#10;time = 20 min/GT; &#10;strength = 50-100 men/SP (Regimental/Brigade Size)&#10;&#10;",

After four rounds, the group wins if they have made fewer mistakes than there are players.&#10;&#10;The cards feature words of two difficulty levels, and the group decides together which level to play.&#10;&#10;",

Players use the code to identify the correct subject word. Everyone prepares in their mind a ONE WORD clue related to the secret subject.  The challenge is to choose a clue that shows other players that you know the secret subject but is not so obvious that it reveals the secret to the Gooseberry.  When all players have prepared their clue and are ready, each player, in clockwise order and without hesitation, says out loud the clue they have prepared.&#10;&#10;Players may now discuss, question and accuse each other.  When ready everyone votes on who they think is the Gooseberry.

    "description": "&quot;A game of plane to plane combat in World War I&quot;&#10;&#10;There is plenty of goodies in the box, including three geomorphic map boards, plenty of thick counters, and as much rules as you can stomach. Luckily, you can select both your level of realism (i.e. complexity: ranging from the Mass Game to the Duel Game) and the length of the scenario (30 min to 4 hours), so the game is pretty flexible in this regard.&#10;&#10;(what follows is abstracted from the ZOCO Historical Simulations Archive review)&#10;&#10;Wings is a simultaneous movement job and can get pretty complex. This is traditional heavy duty boardgaming, not as complex as Advanced Squad Leader but harder than Wooden Ships &amp; Iron Men and only workable with very few planes per player. Thankfully the rules do not all have to be used and Wings works pretty well with basic rules, with some of the advanced and optionals as required. The advanced rules are supposed to be used as a block but consist largely of tricky maneuvers as opposed to the turns and slides of the basic rules. A simpler fleet-style game using plenty of planes is also provided. The scenarios provided include the legendary Wings 6 hex Zeppelin counter, boat targets, bombing, trench-strafing and photo runs.&#10;&#10;The basic problem of WWI air combat as presented in Wings is that the planes are not very good, not very fast, grossly underpowered, turn poorly and chances are that when they get a shot off they tend to miss. As a result, there is a lot of manoeuvring (more than the columns provided on the plotting pad) and relatively little damage (it could have been jotted down separately instead of occupying part of the pad). 3-D is simulated through altitude levels (0 to the 800s --although many planes will not get that high); planes go faster when diving and lose speed when climbing. Go too slow and you will stall and spin downwards until you can pick up enough speed or crash.&#10;&#10;Simultaneous movement games often involve a lot of ESP because it is hard to tell where the opposition is going. Things are not so bad in Wings because planes have bank attitudes showing which way they lean, like in Blue Max. Turning, manoeuvring and climbing restrictions are such that you can narrow down the other plane's intent by carefully paying attention to its banking attitude. Likewise, firing arcs are restricted, and the penalties for firing in a turn and the like are pretty steep, so naturally a plane that thinks it has a good shot will keep pretty straight and level, not too hard to out-manoeuvre. The general problem of planes chasing each other over an endless sky and having limited powers of turning and climbing means they will not often be in each other's guns. Having missed, it will take some time for the planes to all move around back into suitable combat positions. The game is considerably improved by having more than 1 plane on each side, thus ameliorating the chance of someone being able to fire at someone else.&#10;&#10;Gunnery is based on 2D6 rolled as 11 to 66 (a frequent mechanism in Yaquinto games). Results will rarely destroy a target on 1 hit but affect some part of the plane. When not hitting Structure, your hits will likely reduce the limited performance of the planes. Some hits can reduce the power rating of planes. If the target only has 1&#10;power to spend each turn and it loses that, then it is in trouble --it can no longer climb or turn without losing speed and will be forced to dive to get anywhere. It is thus more sensible to fly off when suitably blooded rather than prolonging the game as planes slowly drag themselves back into combat.&#10;&#10;Solitaire gaming works quite well because the rules severely limit what a plane can do so the guessing is kept low. Play actually improves with more players as this generates more opportunities for mayhem. 50 plane types are provided although Yaquinto never published Wings II so other planes are referred to in the force tables that have no details (although it just may be possible to figure out those &quot;missing&quot; planes' characteristics from their counterparts in Blue Max and Knights of the Air). The planes are rated differently, but unfortunately performance varies with altitude so you need to check the plane reference card frequently --whilst the gun data is on the opposite side of the card.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Wargame based around the WW2 Western Allied campaign from just after the Normandy invasion to the crossing of the Rhine.&#10;&#10;First significant mechanic is the unpredictable turn order - players dice for each turn, with the highest taking the turn. However, ties end that month's play (players draw fresh supply points each month, and the game ends after 20 months).&#10;&#10;Second significant mechanic is the use of (limited) supply points to activate stacks of units when it's your turn. Like games such as We the People/Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage/Rommel in the Desert/Napoleon, you don't have the resources to activate all of your units each turn, you need to decide what the current priority is in line with the current situation. Activation generally allows you to either move stacks or attack with stacks, but with an increased expenditure of supply points, you can take more powerful 'breakthrough' turns involving both movement and attack.&#10;&#10;These mechanics (unpredictable turn order, limited ability to activate units each turn) create a game of fluid tactical situations, where your planning has to be flexible - you never know who will get the next turn.&#10;&#10;The Allied player has to break out of the beach head and capture additional supply ports (which raise the number of supply points available to the Allies, and hence the number of activations possible) en route to Germany. The German player must contain the Allies in Normandy for as long as possible before falling back to the Rhine, while also denying the valuable supply ports to the Allies as long as possible. The Allies are up against a tight timetable; the Germans must work against as increasing disadvantage in supply points.&#10;&#10;Victory is generally determined by the difference in numbers between German units West of the Rhine and Allied units East of the Rhine at game end. Allied paratroops, the German Bulge offensive, reinforcements/replacements and strategic movement add to the game. The big mounted map with large hexes and counters remove the 'fiddle factor' which can blight wargames with lower production values.&#10;&#10;Republished in Command Magazine Japan #64 in 2005.&#10;&#10;",

One end comprises both teams throwing their eight (or four) stones in turns. At the end of an end the team whose stone is closest to the button is awarded one point for each of its own stones that are closer than the opponent's closest stone.&#10;&#10;The game works well with 2, 4, or 8 players as the players are always separated into two competing teams.

Caesar and the Romans - the VI, XXVII, and XXXVII legions, lots of archers and auxiliaries, and a dangerous contingent of field artillery - control the center of the city, including the Palace and the Inner Harbor. The Egyptians - a mixture of heavy, medium, and light infantry, and a numerically superior galley fleet - control the Outer Harbor, the rest of the city, and all land approaches to it.&#10; The Romans must defend their city position and also take control of the Heptastadium, the bridge that connects the city to the island of Pharos and its lighthouse, one of the Seven Wonders of the World.&#10; Caesar in Alexandria combines GBoH with War Galley: Naval Warfare in the Ancient World, with rules for both systems included. On land, the game is closer to Simple GBoH (which is not needed to play this), mostly because the form of warfare involved here: street-fighting. Caesar in Alexandria also uses the SGBoH command and activation system, which is what produces the large dose of tension. Do you move legions to protect your inner defense, or do you continue to attack the town of Pharos to gain access to the Heptastadium? Do you transport land troops to the island, or do you move your battle galleys out to sea, around Pharos, and into the Outer Harbor to attack the Egyptian fleet? Each turn you can do only one, all the while your opponent is considering his several, difficult options.&#10;&#10;Included are some small scenarios for quicker play.&#10;&#10;",

In Alienation, you will assume the role of a real-estate agent attempting to satisfy various alien creature clientele.  But watch out for your rival competitors, because they will surely be trying to corner the market.  Finish with the most points after 3 rounds to win the game!&#10;&#10;Players will draft a hand of 9 alien creature cards.  Creature cards may have 1, 2, or 3 creatures displayed in one of 6 races:  Friendlies, Meanies, Rowdies, Sleepies, Matchies, and Sunnies.  Each race has very distinct personalities and interacts differently with their neighbors.  On his/her turn, the starting player will take one of 2 actions:&#10;&#10;1. Play 1 card in his/her own solar system.&#10;    2. Play 1 card in another player&rsquo;s solar system.&#10;&#10;All cards must be played either adjacent or diagonal to the sun card.  Play proceeds left.  The next player then takes one of the 2 actions.  Once your solar system has 8 creature cards surrounding the sun, it is full.  You may now ONLY play cards in other players&rsquo; solar systems.  The round ends once all solar systems are filled.  The final card in each player&rsquo;s hand is placed into the discard pile.  Each player will now score his/her solar system.&#10;&#10;",

Outshine and outpace other Allied generals &ndash; and change history by winning the war in 1944, before Christmas!&#10;&#10;Keep&rsquo;em Rolling: Race to the Rhine features Race to the Rhine, a unique, logistics-focused euro-style wargame for 1-4 players (including a solitaire mode as well as optional cards and rules), and a standalone solitaire game &ndash; These Are My Credentials &ndash; covering the Allied liberation of Brittany.&#10;&#10;As one of the historic Allied Commanders, you control several Corps that you must move along predefined, point-to-point routes, liberating cities from Axis control as you do.&#10;&#10;Unlike many other wargames covering the liberation of Western Europe, in Race to the Rhine the focus is on planning and logistics. Moving your Corps requires fuel. Defeating Axis units and garrisons en route requires ammo. Feeding your armies as they move forward requires food.&#10;&#10;The slower you are in moving to the Rhine, the longer you give the Axis to form a strong defense. But move too quickly and you risk overwhelming your logistical capacity to supply your advance. Whichever Commander can best manage these dual challenges will win the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

To accommodate this, as well as to depict salient features of an 18th century siege event, several new mechanics including an abstract siege and bombardment table, and a random events deck have been added to the core game system.  Unlike previous games in the series, initial turns are strategic, reflecting troop movements over 1 and 2-day periods and allowing for the buidling of defenses by both sides.  When the American/French player decides to assault the city, the game switches to the familiar tactical game turns reflecting a single hour of battle.&#10;&#10;Random Events is one of ten new features and a deck of 55 Random Event cards is provided, most of which define historical events from the actual siege and assault. Players have a maximum of nine opportunities to draw from the deck, although players may use Momentum Chits to &quot;purchase&quot; extra card pulls. Some cards benefit only the Allied Player(s), others benefit only the British Player and some can benefit either player. The cards include both political cards, which may add or dismiss troops to the battle, and tactical cards which effect single combat turns or even single rolls.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "This game takes fantasy with magic, elves, dwarves, orcs, trolls etc., and puts them in a cyberpunk world 60 years in the future.&#10;&#10;There are 7 types of cards...&#10;&#10;&#10;    Runners - You collect groups of these characters and use them to make runs on objectives.  Some of these can  support the group through computers while staying safe at home.  These cards have symbols on them that represent their abilities and these are use to bypass threats without actually having to face them.&#10;    Objectives - These are what you are making runs on.  They are worth reputation points and usually have a task that you must best or a number of symbols that you have to match with the symbols on your runners.&#10;    Challenge - You assign these to the objectives as additional hurdles that you have to get by before you can tackle the objective.  Usually you can overcome them with the right symbols but if not they can represent nasty things you will have to fight or things that will just hurt you.&#10;    Gear - This is stuff that you assign to runners to help them make runs.  Some gear requires you to have a runner with a matching symbol.&#10;    Locations - These represent places that you control and can help you in various ways.&#10;    Contacts - These represent people that will help you. &#10;    Specials - These are instants that you play to affect the current situation.&#10;&#10;&#10;Everything is driven by money which is hard to come by.  It costs money to acquire almost every card and a lot of cards require money spent just to keep them in play or every time you use them.&#10;&#10;",

These two types of birds must reach their breeding ground in good shape by eating berries and bugs to gain energy on route &ndash; but flying costs them energy.&#10;&#10;In Tweeeet, each player is a bird and belongs to the robins or the bluethroats. The landscape tiles build a migration route from south to north. In this landscape are empty spaces (grassland), impassable spaces (lakes), and tree spaces, which hold the birds' food. Each turn you move to a new tree space, and the number of spaces moved equals the amount of energy lost. But you eat the food in the tree where you land &ndash; eating a strawberry brings 2 energy points, purple berries 3, a caterpillar 4, and a beetle 5 &ndash; so each turn your energy level goes down (because you fly) and up (because you eat).&#10;&#10;Birds of the same type (robins or bluethroats) can speak about tactics together if they are within a &quot;crow flies&quot; distance of six spaces from one another. When they're seperated by 7-9 spaces, they may only twitter, and when ten or more spaces apart, they may only flap their wings.&#10;&#10;When the surviving birds reach their breeding ground in the north, birds of the same type flock together. Once all birds are in their nests, you calculate the average energy level of your team to see which team is the strongest in the end.&#10;&#10;Online Play&#10;&#10;&#10;     Jijbent.nl (turn-based, Dutch)&#10;&#10;&#10;",

So use your old railroad buildings to stage a gunfight or created an entire economic campaign pitting the ranchers against the sod-busters.  All the tools are in this book.&#10;&#10;Like all Games Workshop books, there is plenty of eye candy and tips on painting and scenery.&#10;&#10;LotOW is proportedly based on Warhammer and Lord of the Rings tabletop battle game with Necromunda and Mordheim mixed in.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "&quot;Fatal Alliances: The Great War 1914-1918&quot; is a World War I version of World in Flames. Like its predecessor, Fatal Alliances is all encompassing and represents every theater and aspect of the First World War. Fatal Alliances expands upon the military system of World in Flames to highlight the diplomatic and civilian fronts.&#10;&#10;When we think of the First World War, we often think of miles of static trenches stretching along the Western Front. Indeed trench warfare was a huge component of the war, but many theaters in the Middle East, Russia, the Balkans, and even Africa were very dynamic &ndash; as even the Western Front was at times. Moreover, Fatal Alliances focuses on the major technological changes the war brought on, on land, at sea, and in the air. In order to prevail on the battlefield, you must coordinate artillery, elite ace-led air forces, gas units, shock troops, engineering units, infantry, cavalry, and early tanks.&#10;&#10;The First World War was truly global, and in Fatal Alliances, the Eastern Front, the Middle East, the Caucasus, Africa, and even Asia and the Americas play a major role. German forces are loose in Africa, and South Africa's loyalty is uncertain. Italy will go to the highest bidder. The Ottomans face Russians in the Caucasus and British Forces along the Suez Canal. China is in turmoil, and could potentially join either side. Japan is nominally an Ally, but Japanese expansionism is already at odds with the interests of other Allied powers. Russia is primed for revolution, with Bolsheviks facing Tsarist forces in a battle for control of the largest swath of land in Eurasia.&#10;&#10;To guide your nation to victory, you must navigate the world of international politics, swaying both minor and major powers to your side. Can you survive civil unrest or military revolution at home, while instigating it abroad? Can you prevent your troops from refusing to fight, and maintain control of your far-flung colonies? Strategic warfare on the seas and in the air must form a vital part of your strategy, preserving your nation&rsquo;s own will to fight while degrading the enemy&rsquo;s. Whatever your strategy, Fatal Alliances: The Great War is a truly dynamic and all-encompassing simulation of every theater of the First World War.&#10;&#10;1680 counters represent the armies, navies, and air forces, which fought in the Great War. Two to five players make the strategic decisions that decide the fate of nations. What forces to produce, where to commit them, when, and how? No two games of Fatal Alliances play the same, no strategy is foolproof, and any decision may have unforeseen consequences.&#10;&#10;",

Gameplay takes place on a 6x6 board.  To set up, you each spread your 18 pieces at random on your half of the board. The black player begins.&#10;&#10;On a turn, choose a piece or a stack of more than one piece that you control--you control a piece/stack if your color is on top--then move that piece/stack so that it lands on something of the same type, i.e., a single piece needs to land on a single piece and a stack on a stack. You move the piece/stack orthogonally 1-3 steps to occupied fields, with the number of steps matching the number of marks on the topmost piece. You can move the piece/stack at a 90&ordm; angle with each step (at an occupied field), so a piece/stack that moves 2 steps can go straight to the second occupied field or it can make a single 90&ordm; turn as it passes over the first occupied field.&#10;&#10;As more spaces become empty, fewer movement options remain open to players, and as soon as any one player cannot move, the game ends. Each player then scores for the pieces and stacks they control. The value of a piece/stack is the number of marks on the topmost piece multiplied by the number of pieces in that stack, which means a piece on its own is worth only 1-3 points. Whoever has the higher score wins.&#10;&#10;",

King Artus sends them to the valley of Camelot to prove their ability to reign and become the lord of Britain. &#10;Each game turn is divided into 4 seasons. It starts with spring when everybody can either supervise the seed with his knights or move his knights and mercenaries to conquer new fiefs, fight the other players who might retreat in castles, then siege and loot the villages or one of the two monasteries in the valley. Movement is either simultaneous (in three phases) or secretly written down, depending on what the players agree.&#10;In summer and autumn it is the same but in autumn you have to be back at your own fields to supervise the harvest and make sure the farmers give all their grain to their master. &#10;Winter gives time to reorder the belongings and spend the gold earned over the year. You have to pay salaries for your men which improve their combat strength for experience, may hire new knights and mercenaries or concentrate on your economy. If you expand too fast without buying beehives, hire fishermen and  foresters you won&acute;t be able to maintain your landed properties. This is the time to build castles and mills as well. At the beginning of the next year a random event happens (such as plague, floods or robber barons coming to the valley).&#10;The optional rules add religion (you have to choose a religion and build churches or celtic stone circles) and honour, weather (which influences the harvest) and loyalty of your troops. &#10;Winner is the player who owns first 21 of the 40 fiefs or has the highest amount of honour after ten years of play (optional).&#10;&#10;",

These gangs are commanded by major crooks (boss cards), each of which can have an additional number of secondary burglars (action cards). The more criminals that a player places in a particular district, the more influence they obtain there, so the more likely they are to earn the valuable reward awarded by the district. In addition, players can also collect sets of art pieces that will provide extra victory points at the end of the game. In the end, the player whose gang scores the most victory points wins.&#10;&#10;It's Mine is a gamers' game played in six rounds with a colorful and minimalist design that combines card drafting and set collection with area control mechanism. Players have challenging decisions such as commanding thugs, stealing precious works of art and burning evidences. Each city has its particular set of cards, so the game has a high replay value.&#10;&#10;",

The game covers the Nanboku-cho period of Japanese history and simulates one of the most dynamic and important periods in Japanese history.&#10;&#10;From 1336-1392, all of Japan was aflame with war. After the fall of a corrupt and ineffective emperor, the two great courts of Japan dueled to determine the future ruler of the country. Warriors of Japan covers the vital period following the destruction of the Kamakura shogunate and the fight to find a successor.&#10;&#10;Players of Warriors of God: The Wars of England & France, 1135-1453 will find much familiar here, however, unlike the enormous time period covered in Warriors of God: The Wars of England & France, 1135-1453, Warriors of Japan covers only 4 years. Subtle changes in the system to cover this unique period have been exchanged in Warriors of Japan. For example, Leaders no longer die from old age but rather can switch sides unexpectedly during a combat. Subtle changes in the movement and combat rules will add to the strategy to a greater extent than in Warriors of God: The Wars of England & France, 1135-1453. A random game start generator will keep each game fresh and interesting. Warriors of Japan also brings us home to our wargaming roots. To learn and discover some new period of history that we didn&rsquo;t know about before in much the same way we discovered history through our wonderful hobby in our youth.&#10;&#10;Warriors of Japan Components:&#10;&#10;     One 34&rdquo; by 22&rdquo; map&#10;     140 1&rdquo; counters&#10;     16 page full color rulebook&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Details:&#10;&#10;      Solitaire Rating: Excellent&#10;      Complexity: Easy&#10;      Playing Time: 4-10 hours&#10;      Scenarios: 1&#10;&#10;&#10;(from MMP website)&#10;&#10;",

The more animals of a type that you see together, the better &mdash; yet you also want to diversify your sightings, while moving your totem animal toward the pack ice as far as possible.&#10;&#10;In Arctic, you move across the landscape and spot animals, creating a pile of animal cards in front of you. The card on top of your personal pile is your &quot;visible&quot; animal card. Each animal card contains four pieces of information:&#10;&#10;&#10;     A placement value&#10;     The main animal depicted on the card&#10;     A companion animal&#10;     A draw value&#10;&#10;&#10;At the start of your turn, place as many cards from your hand into your personal pile as the placement value of your visible animal card. (On your first turn, place one animal from your starting hand of three cards.) For each card you can't place, draw a card facedown from the deck and place it in a personal penalty pile. Next, using your new visible animal card, move the token of the main animal forward one space on the landscape and the companion animal backward one space or vice versa. Finally, draw as many animal cards from the &quot;river&quot; of six animal cards as the draw value of your visible animal card. (If you now have more than seven cards in hand, discard into your penalty pile until you have seven.)&#10;&#10;Each time you place an animal on your pile, take the matching animal power card from the center of play or whoever currently has it. You can use the listed power each turn for as long as you hold this card, such as moving an animal token an additional space, drawing from your penalty pile, or refilling the river after each card you draw.&#10;&#10;When the deck runs out, you finish the round, then place cards one more time, then score points. For each type of animal, you score points based on the largest set of consecutive cards of this type you have in your pile. You score a bonus based on the number of sets you've completed. Reveal the animal token you received at the start of the game, and score based on how far it advanced across the landscape. Lose 1 point for each card in your penalty pile. Whoever has the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;",

On top of that, the game includes several modular expansions, historical scenarios, and a competitive mode that allows 1 additional player to lead the Hispanic resistance against Rome.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "On 18 July 1936, various generals in the Spanish army rose up against the government of the Second Republic. The failure of the coup as it had been originally planned gave way to a civil conflict between the defenders of the democratic government and the backers of the military coup. Machado&rsquo;s two Spains fought each other for nearly three years in a battle which reflected the political and social tensions affecting the world at that time.&#10;&#10;The opposing armies were very different: on one hand, the Republican army possessed a limited number of professional soldiers and many popular militias belonging to political parties and labor unions. To this were added the International Brigades, formed from foreign volunteers of diverse origin; a fighting force which was highly motivated, but poorly coordinated and typically poorly organized. On the other hand, the Franco&acute;s army had most of the professional military, along with Carlist and fascist militias, many native Moroccan troops, and the volunteers of the Condor Legion and the Corpo Trupe Voluntarie, sent by Hitler and Mussolini, respectively.&#10;&#10;From a military point of view, the Spanish Civil War presaged the global conflict which would soon erupt. In the mid-1930s, military high commands from all over the globe theorized on the possibilities of motorized armies and &ldquo;lightning war&rdquo;. Both Nazis and Soviets rehearsed armored tactics in Spain, and tested various types of weapons. In addition, the importance that air superiority would have on all later conflicts was made clear. All of these elements make the Spanish Civil War a fascinating conflict from an historical point of view and with regard to military strategy.&#10;&#10;Help Arrives!

The WSS promises many hours of fierce fighting between the infantry, tanks, artillery and aircraft belonging to the armies enveloped in this conflict.

The system emphasizes the role of officers. Officers can activate units, coordinate with other officers and their units, call for artillery support, air support, influence moral checks, coordinate assaults, and much more. Rules for special actions.&#10;&#10;Based on the principle of simultaneous execution, or simply &quot;WE GO&quot;, a hybrid system of turns and &quot;real time&quot;. The players must activate unit leaders to perform many actions (fire, assault, move, coordinate, etc). A turn ends when both players have completed all their activations. The scale is platoon level with units&#10;&#10;Representing groups of between 30 and 40 soldiers, weapons units represents groups of 3-4 weapons and their accompanying crews (20-25 soldiers), and the AFvs-Transports representing groups of 3 to 5 vehicles and their corresponding crews. Scenarios are divided into turns representing about 12-15 minutes of action.&#10;&#10;Turns are divided into the following phases: Command Phase, Initiative Phase, Activation Phase and Marker Removal Phase&#10;&#10;The game uses isomorphic mapboards, each of which are aligned to any edge of equal length on any other mopboard. This allows for an almost unlimited number of combinations to create any terrain situation, including player designed scenarios.

The color is given by the card and the player must choose a place on the island for it responding to priorities of the played settler card. For example: 1st priority for the new building is a place near the river, 2nd priority near a red building, 3rd priority near the coast and the 4th priority near a brown building. The player must build the house following this priorities.&#10;&#10;The second action of his turn is to put a settler card on the table. This card belongs to the ship.&#10;After every player has done his 2 actions the ship arrives and those cards are played. The building of a card gets the player who fulfills the (highest possible) priority best.&#10;After the ship phase a next turn starts.&#10;&#10;The player can change 2 or 3 houses in more valuable buildings and can get privilege cards for being the best in one building color.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game the player with the most points for the buildings wins.&#10;&#10;",

While challenging enough for serious puzzlers, it also features a rich, emotional narrative composed by New York Times bestselling YA novelist Tommy Wallach, which will have you and your loved ones feeling all the feelings.&#10;&#10;The game is divided up into three acts, each of which contains a trove of documents and puzzles, all of them beautifully crafted and cunningly designed--ostensibly by Mary Shelley herself--in order to reveal a great secret she left to her only surviving child. A bonus edition also includes a full copy of the 1818 edition of Frankenstein with additional puzzles from Emerald Flame creator Rita Orlov (PostCurious).&#10;&#10;Over the course of the game, you'll also build a 500 piece 2D puzzle and a 350 piece 3D puzzle, ending up with a gorgeous recreation of Frankenstein's castle you can keep forever!&#10;&#10;Simply put, there's never before been a game like Mother of Frankenstein.

    "description": "1861.  Civil erupts across America.  Abraham Lincoln and Jefferson Davis vie for control of the nation&rsquo;s destiny, with both understanding that the struggle is as much political as it is a process of arms.  Victory in battle will provide the most persuasive political argument when it comes to the five slave states bordering those already in contention &ndash; Delaware, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, and West Virginia.  These are the states both the Confederacy and the Union need to win over.  In each case, how these scales will tip, favoring either abolition or those who endorse the doctrine of human &ldquo;property,&rdquo; is yet to be decided.  Battle and politics will sway the balance, and the result will help tell the story of this bloody war.&#10;&#10;Border States is a tactical game for 2 players, with each player taking control of one side. Your aim is to win the sort of decisive victories that will influence the Border States and rally them to your cause. Effective bluff, and at the same time being able to discern your enemy&rsquo;s intentions, will be your best assets.  Playing time is about 45 minutes.&#10;&#10;There are two ways to win the game: control sufficient States tokens to win by sudden death, or be the player with the most victory points at the end of the 5 rounds.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Gentlemen Thieves is a board game with secret identities, bluffing and theft featuring Ars&egrave;ne Lupin and other characters inspired by author Maurice Leblanc. Whoever ends up with the biggest stack of loot at the end of the game wins!&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, each player secretly takes one of the five burglar tiles, which come in five different colors; each player also receives 2-4 helping hand tokens. Five locations are set out, each with two randomly chosen equipment tokens next to them; equipment tokens come in five types, with each type appearing in the five colors of the burglars. Special tokens are placed out as well: two loot tokens next to the bank, one lock on the museum, and one tunnel next to the manor; six additional loot tokens, along with a car token and the second tunnel, are placed to the side. Three randomly drawn equipment tokens are placed face up.&#10;&#10;At the start of each round, the matchmaker determines the alliances for that round, placing two alliance markers &ndash; each showing a burglar in the appropriate color &ndash; in one area and the other three in the other area. Thus, the burglars form provisional teams for the round and are trying to work together to rob a location &ndash; any location! &ndash; but they don't necessarily know who's who. On a turn a player either:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Chooses one of the face-up equipment tokens, places it next to a location (with no more than three tokens of the same type being allowed at a location), then reveals a new equipment token.&#10;    Draws the top equipment token from the stack, then places it at a location.&#10;    Plays a helping hand token to move a special token or add a new special token to a location.&#10;&#10;&#10;As soon as all five types of equipment are at a location, a burglary takes place there. Who steals the goods? The alliance that has the larger presence there based on the colors of tokens. These tokens are then flipped face down (becoming loot), added to any loot tokens present there, then split among the burglars in the alliance and placed on the scoreboard. The matchmaker token passes to a new player, who must move at least two alliance tokens, then a new round begins.&#10;&#10;The special tokens naturally change the rules: The location with the lock cannot be robbed, although someone can choose to move the lock so that a burglary does take place. The car allows someone to move an equipment token to a new location. When the second tunnel is placed next to a location, the two locations with tunnels are now linked and the types of equipment present are considered to be together when determining whether a burglary takes place &ndash; although if the lock is on one of those locations, then nothing can be stolen!&#10;&#10;A brigadier token is shuffled into the final six equipment tokens, and when it's drawn, the game ends immediately. Players then reveal their identities, and the player with the most loot wins!&#10;&#10;",

Although he did seize the Austrian capital on May 13, the Danube still separated the Emperor from the army of the Archduke Charles. To pull off a decisive victory, he now had to force a crossing of the river and defeat the Austrians as swiftly as possible. On May 20 in mid-afternoon 200 skirmishers of Molitor&rsquo;s division crossed the backwater which separated the island of Lobau from the left bank of the Danube. By the next day, a beautiful Pentecost Sunday, the French were on the left bank with 30,000 men, including 6,000 cavalry, and were ready for battle. Grounded on the villages of Aspern and Essling and covered on the wings by the river, their base was solid. For his part, the Archduke Charles decided to go over to the attack quickly so as to destroy the troops who had just crossed the Danube. He had over 60,000 men available, organized into five columns, and before long the Austrians would have 90,000. After the battle had begun, several of the bridges over the Danube were temporarily broken, preventing the French from receiving the reinforcements necessary for victory. During the two days of May 21 and 22 the divisions on the ground, commanded by Mass&eacute;na and Lannes, would have to resist heroically as the enemy launched a series of massive assaults. The victory was delayed until later : in less than three months, that would be Wagram !&#10;&#10;Aspern-Essling 1809 is the 26th battle of the series Jours de Gloire, launched in 1997 with Rivoli 1797 (Vae Victis n&deg;18). The game covers the two days of the battle (May 21 and 22, 1809), with special rules dealing with the command situation of the French army (Lannes and Mass&eacute;na). The bridges between the island of Lobau and the left bank of the Danube also hold an important place in the simulation.&#10;&#10;Aspern-Essling 1809 includes :&#10;a 59 x 40 cm map,&#10;216 double-sided die-cut counters and markers,&#10;a color rulebook with scenarios and a player aid.&#10;&#10;Units : Regiments and brigades&#10;Map scale : 330 m/hex.&#10;Turn : 90 minutes&#10;Complexity : 6 / 9&#10;&#10;French or English Rules / Charts (1st edition).&#10;French and English Rules / Charts (2nd edition).&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "An anchovy in the floppy drive?! This can only mean one thing: There's a dolphin on board the spaceship!&#10;&#10;Each player controls a team of up to four astronauts with different abilities, possibly fooled by a murderous dolphin. During dangerous spacewalks, the astronauts try to repair the sabotaged spaceship, unaware whether their companion is helping them or secretly trying to undermine the mission. After each spacewalk, the Captain decides the fate of his crew members. However, a crew in panic can easily overthrow his shifty captain and send him to the void.&#10;&#10;Houston, We Have a Dolphin! is a card-based social deduction game especially designed for a low player count of 3-5 players. The game consists of two alternating phases. During the spacewalk phase, the players try to trigger certain events by combining their cards, only knowing their own though. The actual happenings can lead them to find out who's on which side as the dolphins are working against the arrangements.&#10;&#10;In the following Captain phase, the captain decides whether to sacrifice an astronaut from a team of his choice; flood the spaceship, which means the victory of the dolphins; or reset it, the goal of the humans, which is only possible after repairing the spaceship. At this point, the crew has the chance to revolt against the captain and his order, by secretly voting with their panic tokens.&#10;&#10;Houston, We Have a Dolphin! is app supported, which allows an in-app narrator and an easy-to-follow game tutorial. To combine the physical astronaut cards with the digital spaceship, HYBR primarily uses magic, helped by their in-house developed image detection algorithm.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "In Dragon Market, players attempt to manipulate boats on a river in order to pick up the items they need to complete objective cards.&#10;&#10;In more detail, each player starts the game with their figure on a pontoon in the corner of the board, and they take turns placing boats on the board, with each boat taking up three spaces; some boats have a sailor in the center space, while others have a sailor in the end seat. Each of the two empty spaces of each boat are then filled with two identical merchandise tokens, with the game including twenty types of merchandise. Each player starts the game with an objective card showing four different types of merchandise.&#10;&#10;On a turn, the active player rolls the dice to determine how many actions they can take; they can spend 1-2 coins to add to this number of actions. Actions are:&#10;&#10;&bull; Slide a boat: You can move a boat any number of unoccupied spaces either forward or backward; a boat cannot move sideways.&#10;&bull; Rotate a boat: You can rotate a boat 90&ordm; around its sailor through unoccupied spaces.&#10;&bull; Move your figure: You can move your figure one space from a pontoon to a space on the boat that's empty or occupied by merchandise tokens or from one boat space to another or from a boat to a pontoon; you cannot move your figure over a sailor. When you move your figure onto a merchandise token showing on your objective card, you can pick it up.&#10;&#10;If you don't spend all of your actions, take coins equal to the number of unspent actions to bank them for later. As soon as you have all of the merchandise needed for your objective card, return to your pontoon. Once you do, you draw a second objective card, and whoever completes two objective cards first wins.&#10;&#10;Dragon Market also contains advanced objective cards that show 3-4 types of merchandise as well as a bonus. At the start of the game, each player draws two cards and keeps one of them. As soon as the player returns to their pontoon with the depicted goods, they reveal this objective card, then have access to this bonus, which provides either a one-time effect or an effect that can be used once each turn. They also draw two new objective cards and keep one of them. Whoever first completes three objective cards wins!&#10;&#10;The game also includes team rules for both the regular and the advanced objective cards.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "From the rules overview: &quot;In the Queen&rsquo;s service, the Musketeers are trying to acquire three valuable gems. However, the Cardinal and his dreaded Guards are out to sabotage the Musketeers&rsquo; mission. Many skirmishes between the Musketeers and the Guards ensue. The most successful Musketeers will be awarded gems. Those who fail will be sent to prison and will remain empty handed.&quot;&#10;&#10;Setup: remove some specific cards depending on the number of players. Shuffle and place all Guard cards in the center, along with the Gem and Prison cards. Shuffle the Musketeer cards and deal 12 each.&#10;&#10;Play: players select 3 cards to place face down; these are their potential rewards (Pay cards) this fight. Reveal the top Guard. Players simultaneously select a card, then reveal. If the sum is lower than the Guard strength, the player playing the lowest card places a Prison card on one of his Pay cards. Otherwise, the player with the highest card either places a Gem card on one of his Pay cards, or returns one of his Prison cards to the center. If center area doesn't have a card you need, take it from another player. If all you have 3 Prison cards, your played card doesn't add to the other players' cards.&#10;&#10;The round ends after 9 fights. Players earn silver for their Pay cards, doubled if a Gem is on top and reduced to 0 if a Prison is on top. The player with the most coins wins. Alternatively, keep playing rounds till someone gets 100 or more points, and the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",
