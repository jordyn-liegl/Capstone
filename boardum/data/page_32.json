    "description": "The Discovery is a stand-alone Carcassonne game.&#10;&#10;The inhabitants of Carcassonne have discovered a new region far away from their homeland - one that consists of meadows, mountains and seas. The followers, of which each player only has four (with a fifth for the scoring track) get placed as robbers (in the mountains), seafarers (on the seas) or explorers (on the meadows). On a player's turn, they must place a tile and may then place a follower on it.&#10;&#10;As in the original game, tiles may only be placed so that identical landscape types match up. A follower may only be placed when no other follower has been placed there yet. When the follower is removed, however, then the size of the region in which the follower is located brings points - regardless of whether the region has been closed off or not, although closed off regions score considerably more points. There's also an additional rule that lets mountainous regions increase in value, even if they've already been completed.&#10;&#10;This is a distinctly simpler version of Carcassonne than the original. This was the goal during the development of the game. It should have simpler rules, but offer greater strategic depth. What is interesting about the game is that regions aren't scored automatically any more (when they are closed off), this is a decision left to the player (the removing of the follower). Since the regions can only get more valuable, this ensures many agonizing decisions.&#10;&#10;(From Gamewire and Spielbox)&#10;&#10;This game is part of the Carcassonne series.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Everyone knows of the pyramids on the Nile &mdash; eternal monuments of a powerful and beautiful culture that can still take our breath away. The players (leaders of a royal Egyptian family) choose their sites, build their pyramids, and thank Amun-Re and the other gods for their bounty.&#10;&#10;In Amun-Re, each pharaoh wants to build the most pyramids. To accomplish this, they must first acquire a province where they can trade and farm. With their profits, they can buy new provinces and building stones to erect pyramids. For all their actions, players must make clever use of their power cards and always offer appropriate sacrifices to Amun-Re.&#10;&#10;Amun-Re: 20th Anniversary Edition features new modules that can be added to the game:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Officials Variant: The Officials variant can only be played with two or three players. It gives players an additional Scribe for bidding. Each round players will bid for two provinces, keeping control of just one and gaining the Officials card from the other. The Officials cards offer exciting instant bonuses.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Afterlife Expansion: The Afterlife expansion adds a fourth item you can buy in the market phase - Tomb tiles. Players place the tiles into their own personal pyramid shape, starting with a base of up to five tiles. Each placed tile gives the player a bonus, and this bonus is multiplied if the tile is placed on top of matching tiles within the pyramid. At the end of the game, each completed row of tiles is worth points.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Statues Expansion: In each of the first three rounds, grand statues are added to certain provinces. These statues each grant unique powers to the player who controls the province in which they are built. This expansion adds extra interest to the auction phase and gives players their own player powers that may vary each time. The statues will be miniatures representing Egyptian gods.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Pharaoh Mini Expansion: This mini expansion adds tension to the auction phase by rewarding players for overbidding other players. The Pharaoh moves to each province that is overbid, and at the conclusion of the auctions the player who wins the province with the Pharaoh receives a token that grants extra rewards in the subsequent offerings phase.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Summit uses a unique karma system that allows players to actively help or hinder their opponents &mdash; but it also affects end game scoring. For a few extra points, you could share some of your valuable food or oxygen, or maybe you can afford to lose some points so you choose to cut their rope and watch them disappear down the mountain.&#10;&#10;In a cooperative or solo game, players must now work together to overcome the mountain and survive the expedition. Summit is a game so grueling you need only one team member to survive the ascent and descent, so players may sacrifice themselves for the good of the team. The mountain has a &quot;Sherpa Track&quot; and a &quot;Time of Day Track&quot; added, as well as a whole new deck of cards. It is unlikely everyone will be returning from this expedition.&#10;&#10;With over 190 unique cards, nearly 100 tiles, unique resource management and tracking on dual-layer asymmetrical player mats and the ability to customize your difficulty and game length, Summit guarantees you will never play the same game twice!&#10;&#10;",

Your task is to group animals of the same species together in families as large as possible. But large families are only half the battle: to score a lot of points, they also need access to watering holes and must avoid bad weather.&#10;&#10;A turn comprises two simple steps: First, one player chooses a feature (species or watering hole) and a terrain requirement from a limited selection. Then, each player must place one of their tokens showing that feature onto one of their park spaces obeying that terrain requirement. What seems no trouble at first grows more and more challenging and exciting as the available spaces become fewer and fewer. But it&rsquo;s not only the choices of your fellow players that can disrupt your plans. There are also unpredictable weather tokens that you must take into account.&#10;&#10;After five rounds, the game ends. Then you score your most valuable family of each species and the terrains you completely populated.&#10;&#10;Caldera Park is an interactive puzzle-game that achieves a perfect balance between strategic planning and luck.

    "description": "Defenders of The Last Stand is a post apocalyptic adventure game by Richard Launius (Arkham Horror, Run Fight or Die, Defenders of the Realm) and Jason Maxwell (Agents of SMERSH, Mythos Tales) for 1-5 players set in the Western United States more than 50 years after nuclear war.  Players take on the roles of Defenders of the last known haven for humanity, called The Last Stand. Four outside clans leaders, along with their followers, advance toward the town, and players work cooperatively to defend The Last Stand.  Menacing mutants also roam the desert threatening the city's survival. The game will introduce player character mutations - your character can mutate from travel into irradiated areas. Gameplay will consist of both elements of adventure and conflict resolution, and Defenders of the Last Stand will come loaded with miniatures, including three large sculpted miniatures of the invading Clan leaders as well as their minions - sculpted by Chad Hoverter. The four warrior clans include raiders on bikes and in cars; Amazons on large mutated beasts; a third clan of techno savvy, yet criminally insane youths; and finally a large winged creature so mutated that he has lost all traces of his old humanity.&#10;&#10;&quot;Today we discovered a fallen caravan not fifteen miles up dry road. I had been that way to visit Auntie's just recently and there weren't no caravans, fallen or otherwise, there before. This means the Raiders have been circling the last stand for at least the last two weeks. Pepzi asked me to stay a while in case they attack. No more scavenging for now, she said. &quot;Something is brewing. The air hurts my lungs. I see shadows in the hillside.&quot; The air is more dry than usual. My lips have all but cracked off. Doc gives me salve to put on them, but I tell him to keep it for the kids. New families are appearing in Stanfield. It's a good sight to see. We are finally surviving a bit, and bringing kids into this world again. I'm thinking of how in the good book we are told to be multiply. It's God's will, but most would say this land has been forsaken by God, but I'm hoping we can start again. Me, I'm hoping for the best, but my bones tell me there is no best.&#10;&#10;&quot;The Last Stand was known as Stanfield before the great war. While battles raged in the cities across America and the world, old-schoolers, cowboys, fighters, and drifters came together in this desert to escape the end of the world. The desert was only the safe place and Detroit says it's where a man learns to be a man. Detroit told me that Stanfield changed its name to The Last Stand back then. Cause it was the last fighting chance for humanity. Detroit knows lots of stories. He is old and claims he was alive in those days, 80 something years ago, back when they played something called baseball and Nitena. I don't know what to believe from his mouth, but he is a hoot to listen to. Course, he has been around a long time, changed by the Radiation &ndash; mutated like many folks, but still as human as human can be,  unlike the raiders. Detroit is one of us now. He knows stuff and and we are going to fight tooth and nail against the raiders wanting to take what we worked so hard to build. Rumor is that they have merged, and I reckon they will have to to capture this city. We are bonded together. Even got a little ancient technology and oil. Bad stuff maybe since it is what brought us here. We'll use it carefully.  The Last Stand may be our last hope.  I don't know if there are any other cities out there worth fighting for.&quot;&#10;--From the Journal of Marha Bourne Star&#10;&#10;",

An oilfield with drilling sites scattered about is spread out before the players, who take their trucks out trying to grab those sites as quickly as possible.&#10;&#10;Three groups of tiles are laid over the drilling sites, giving a range of value for each site once it has been reached by a player.  The deeper a site is into the field the greater its overall yield. But players have to weigh this against creating a constant supply from the smaller yields that are closer at the beginning of the game.&#10;&#10;Once oil has been produced, players can attempt to sell it on the market. But there are only three companies, and with four players this means that one player will be shut out each turn.  Bidding has an interesting element to it in that player's bidding pools are hidden from one another, making it difficult to tell whether a player is bluffing.&#10;&#10;Reimplemented as Black Gold&#10;&#10;",

Their objective is for the king to escape by reaching any of the four corner squares. The attackers comprise 24 soldiers positioned in four groups of 6 around the perimeter of the board. All pieces move like the Rook in chess and pieces are taken by &quot;sandwiching&quot; i.e. moving your piece so that an opponent's piece is trapped horizontally or vertically between two of yours. There is a host of information on the Internet about Hnefatafl, including many rule variations that are worth experimenting with.&#10;&#10;A copy of the game was published in issue #128 of Dragon magazine, Dec 1987 (later republished as part of a boxed set: The Best of Dragon Magazine Games in 1990).&#10;&#10;One of the oldest games in the world - traced in various versions to the Vikings, Welsh, Saxons, and Irish.

    "description": "The sub-tropical climate and environment of Taiwan makes the island highly suitable for cultivating top quality tea. But it wasn't not until the 19th century after English businessman John Dodd discovered some amazing Oolong tea there that the Taiwanese tea business truly begin to bloom and &quot;Formosa Tea&quot; became world-reknowned.&#10;&#10;In Formosa Tea, players are tea farm owners competing to harvest the best tea leaves, improve their tea processing techniques, and produce tea of the highest quality for not only the domestic market but also for the international market. With the unique worker placement and worker advancement mechanisms, along with the tea dehydration and scenting processing, players must use their workers wisely to make the best tea in the market.&#10;&#10;A game of Formosa Tea is played in four rounds. In each round, players take turns to perform one of the five possible actions:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Send a worker to harvest tea leaves&#10;    Send a worker to a tea factory to  process tea leaves&#10;    Retrieve a worker from the tea factory after tea processing is completed&#10;    Send a worker to sell tea in the domestic market&#10;    Send a worker to sell tea to international merchants. &#10;&#10;&#10;After the end of the fourth round, the player who has the most prestige points wins!&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Based upon the stories by Robert E. Howard (creator of Conan), Solomon Kane is a narrative adventure board game featuring exceptional 35mm miniatures. It is a highly innovative co-operative game of storytelling, resource management, and tactical miniatures play. Players take the part of the invisible powers of good and light who aid Solomon Kane in his quest to overcome the forces of Darkness. Each player is one of the four Cardinal Virtues: Courage, Prudence, Temperance, and Justice, each with special powers that reflect their unique role.&#10;&#10;Drawing upon Howard&rsquo;s famous tales of the Puritan avenger, the core box allows players to tell their own versions of the Rattle of Bones, Skulls in the Stars, and Blue Flame of Vengeance. Expansions recreate Howard&rsquo;s other Solomon Kane stories, as well as adding original adventures for the hero, created especially for the game.&#10;&#10;In Solomon Kane, each of Howard&rsquo;s tales is told as one or more Acts, with each Act comprising a full game session. Shorter stories like Rattle of Bones can be completed in a single session, whilst longer tales will take multiple sessions to play through.&#10;&#10;An Act is broken down into 8-10 Chapters, and each Chapter has multiple possible outcomes depending upon the actions of the players. Some Chapters offer story choices, whereas others see the action play out on the game board as the players work together to aid Solomon Kane in his quest.&#10;&#10;Using custom card decks and dice, each Virtue can control Solomon Kane or his allies, moving them around the board, fighting enemies, exploring locations, and interrogating suspects for information. If the odds get too stacked against Solomon Kane, the Virtues can even manifest directly to intervene on the board.&#10;&#10;Opposing Solomon Kane and the players is the Darkness. This twisted reflection of the Virtues is controlled by an AI deck which determines the actions of enemy miniatures, thwarts the player&rsquo;s best plans, and competes with them to drive the story in an evil and unholy direction.&#10;&#10;The world of Solomon Kane is brought to life through the stunning artistic vision of Guillem H. Pongiluppi and game designer Jake Thornton, whose &lsquo;puppet master&rsquo; game mechanics break new ground in co-operative gameplay. With multiple versions of every single Chapter, Solomon Kane is able to combine immersive storytelling with abundant replayability for a truly unique gameplay experience.&#10;&#10;Who is Solomon Kane?&#10;Solomon Kane is a dour English Puritan and redresser of wrongs. He roams the world, fighting against the ungodly and evil works of men and foul magic alike. He follows no master save his conscience, though that alone drives him to the ends of the Earth to fulfil his quest.&#10;&#10;All his life he has travelled, aiding the weak and fighting oppression. From the bleak moors of England, through the damp forests of Germany, to the sweltering jungles and savannahs of Africa &ndash; even to the shores of the distant New World of America. He neither knows nor questions why is driven to do this. It simply must be done.&#10;&#10;To Solomon Kane he is the fulfiller of God&rsquo;s judgment; a vessel of wrath to be emptied onto the souls of the unrighteous. To his enemies he is an implacable fury, armed with flintlock and rapier, and armoured in unshakeable faith. The knowledge of the rightness of his cause makes him unstoppable, and gives him the ability to overcome any fiend or demon.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "King and Assassins is an asymmetrical fantasy game of strategy and deception for two players. One player controls a vile king and his knightly lackeys who try to force their way into the castle through a mob of wrathful citizens. The other player controls the mob itself and &ndash; more importantly &ndash; three assassins who hide among the crowd hoping to kill or stop the ruler long enough for the people to deal with him using their bare fists. The king has only so much time before he is overpowered by his own subjects but using guile and swords of his guards he may be able to eliminate the assassins and hopefully escape into the safety of his palace.&#10;&#10;The gameplay is based upon Action Cards which show a limited number of Action Points available to both sides. First, the king and his knights move around the board securing their position or eliminating dangers by pushing aside the crowd, then the assassins hidden among the crowd prepare for their lethal strike by killing guards or making the king's progress slower. It's up to the players to make the most of the Action Points available in the current round. The king's player wins if he manages to escape from the board using one of the exits or if his knights eliminate all the assassins. The assassins win if they kill the king by dealing him two wounds or stall him long enough so that the Action Card deck is depleted.&#10;&#10;Choose your strategy, hide the assassins among twelve beautifully illustrated citizens and play two different scenarios, each with a multitude of choices, in this simple yet rewarding game. And remember, every familiar face may conceal a sharp blade!&#10;&#10;",

Each player takes on the role of one of the kingdom&rsquo;s last heroes (nine playable characters), each with a unique set of special abilities, just as they hatch a plan to save the realm.&#10;&#10;Searching the kingdom provides new powers and equipment to strengthen you and your party, as well as the keys that can unlock the holy relics and defeat the necromancer. You can acquire many powerful abilities&mdash;unique to each hero&mdash;that can help to fight the undead, elude the necromancer&rsquo;s forces, accelerate your searches for items and artifacts, and more. The knight is a brave and powerful warrior; the prince can rally and inspire the people; the scholar excels at locating and restoring the treasures of the past.&#10;&#10;But ravenous undead roam the realm, and as the necromancer continues to build his power base, he blights the land and his army steadily grows. As the game wears on, the necromancer becomes more and more powerful, creating blights more quickly and effectively. If an area becomes too blighted, it gets overrun&mdash;and the monastery receives the spillover. And if the monastery is ever overrun, the necromancer wins and the kingdom is swallowed in darkness!&#10;&#10;Before the monastery falls, it's up to you and your party to defeat the necromancer in one of two ways: If you can gather three holy relics and bring them all back to the monastery, you can perform a powerful ritual to break the necromancer&rsquo;s power and scour the land of the undead. Alternatively, you can try to defeat the necromancer in direct combat&mdash;but be warned, he will readily sacrifice his minions to save himself.&#10;&#10;Can you save the kingdom from darkness? Do you have the courage, the cunning and the will to withstand the necromancer and his forces? Strategize, plan and bring out the best of your abilities to end our Darkest Night!&#10;&#10;Game Data:&#10;&#10;Complexity: 4.5 on a 9 scale&#10;Solitaire Suitability: 9 on a 9 scale&#10;Scale: Each unit represents a Hero, the Necromancer or blights in a guerilla war over a small kingdom.

Note that you cannot place your own sea dragons next to each other, and if you place one next to another player's dragon, they receive treasures.&#10;&#10;Your long-term goal is to achieve the greatest presence in each of the four kingdoms at the end of the game and get the most victory points by completing missions and collecting treasures.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;La humanidad se ha vuelto m&aacute;s osada al surcar los mares.

En cada turno, jugaras una de las dos cartas de patrones de tu mano para posicionar un Drag&oacute;n del Mar en el tablero, aumentando tu presencia en los 4 reinos marinos. Pero cuidado, no podr&aacute;s colocar tus propios Dragones del Mar uno junto a otro, y si posicionas alguno  junto al de otro participante, le entregaras tesoros. El objetivo ser&aacute; conseguir la mayor presencia en cada uno de los 4 reinos al finalizar la partida y conseguir la mayor cantidad de puntos de victoria cumpliendo misiones y recogiendo tesoros.&#10;&#10;",

The Atlanteans were able to create and power giant machines called Myths to defend the city from relentless attacks from the outside world trying to take their precious Orichelum.&#10;&#10;The Age of Atlantis is a highly competitive, engine-building, civilization-like game. You and your friends are each an asymmetric noble house trying to become the most politically powerful.

All  while trying to keep Poseidon, the God watching over the city, from flooding the city.

Several optional and experimental rules are provided, including one for opportunity fire to further nullify PanzerBush maneuvers.&#10;&#10;The Panzer Leader map boards are interchangeable with the PanzerBlitz maps, and one could combine the two sets to make a larger battlefield.

Historically, this epic struggle lasted for 6 months and saw the Axis armies reach the Volga and the Caucasus Mountains. But Soviet resistance stiffened and final victory eluded the German army at Stalingrad and in the Caucasus. The ensuing November Soviet offensive trapped the Wehrmacht&rsquo;s largest army (the 6th) at Stalingrad and marked the beginning of the end for Axis fortunes in World War II.&#10;Stalingrad &rsquo;42 uses the same scale and nearly all the rules of Ukraine '43. Many modifications have been made to improve the system and to show crucial features of the campaign. New rules include leaders, elite panzer divisions, planned operations, hidden Soviet buildup, and Army/Front offensive support. &#10; With four maps and low unit density, the game delivers a grand view of the campaign, where decisions about movement and direction of attack have lasting effects that propel or curtail your future strategic plans. The effect is like watching a story unfold and noticing a growing emotional involvement with your forces and plans. In the end, whether in victory or defeat, players of Stalingrad &rsquo;42 will enjoy an epic gaming experience.&#10;&#10;MAP SCALE: 1 hex = 10 miles&#10;TIME SCALE: 1 turn = 3-7 days&#10;NUMBER OF PLAYERS: 2-4&#10;UNIT SCALE: Small Corps/Divisions/Brigades/Regiments&#10;&#10;COMPONENTS&#10;4 Maps (2 full size, 2 small, total footprint 48&quot; x 43.5&quot;)&#10;3 Counter sheets (576 9/16&rdquo; playing pieces)&#10;5 Scenario cards&#10;2 (identical) Player aid cards&#10;1 Rules booklet&#10;1 Playbook with examples of play, design notes, and historical notes&#10;&#10;SCENARIOS&#10;&bull;   Campaign Game: June 28th - December 31st (36 turns)&#10;&bull;   Fall Blau: June 28th - July 28th (8 turns, one full-size map)&#10;&bull;   Caucasus Campaign: August 2nd - November 11th (18 turns, two small maps)&#10;&bull;   Operation Uranus: November 12th - December 31st (9 turns, two full-size maps)&#10;&#10;FEATURES&#10;&bull;   Ease of play&#10;&bull;   Accurate Order of Battle&#10;&bull;   Detailed game maps&#10;&bull;   Rules for: Blitzkrieg warfare, Reserves, Offensive Planning, Sea Movement, Leaders, City Battles, North Caucasus Volunteers, and hidden Soviet buildup.&#10;&#10;SEQUENCE OF PLAY OUTLINE&#10;A.

What mysterious force has drawn them together? What is the purpose of their war? Only the Weaver of Tales knows for certain.&#10;&#10;Driven by deck building, Twisted Fables is a game for two players in 1v1 Mode or four players in 2v2 Mode (available with the separately released 2v2 Upgrade Pack.) In the game, each warrior will strengthen their abilities, learn potent new skills, unlock devastating special powers, and use unique asymmetric strategies to defeat their opponents. Even the same character may display completely different fighting styles depending on her player's decisions. The different specializations a character can choose from not only provide fantastically flexible tactical choices, but also offer one more layer of depth and surprise to this frenetic, frantic fighter. Twisted Fables brings a highly interactive experience to deck builders that you'll want to come back to again and again.&#10;&#10;The book is opened. The fables have arisen. Let's begin.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

These two tournaments are the most important show of legendary martial arts used by powerful athletes. Extraordinary masters are always looking for new talented athletes that will be forged into the ideal of the Perfect Warrior by exhausting training and life experiences that will fortify body, mind and soul.&#10;&#10;&quot;Dojo Kun&quot; means &quot;Dojo Rules&quot; and is a set of principles that guide the physical and spiritual development of the martial art practitioners. Dojo Kun is a game in which each player heads one of the four dojo (Tiger, Crane, Bear, Cobra). The main goal is to train your athletes and attract new ones, buy new training machines, expand your dojo, find adventures, and eventually lead your athletes into winning the martial arts tournament.&#10;&#10;The game is divided into two seasons. During each season there are three preparation turns based on worker placement mechanics in which you will manage your dojo and train your athletes.&#10;&#10;During the season, the athletes can also learn special techniques by visiting one of the ancient masters hidden in the central part of the board. Each season ends with the martial arts tournament, where each dojo can send up to two athletes. In case of empty slots in the tournament, athletes from the fifth dojo (the Skull Dojo) will attend. (These athletes are managed by the game and can even win the tournament!)&#10;&#10;Combat between athletes is simulated by throwing a set of custom dice. There are four different dice, one for each fighting technique. Players will roll dice according their athlete's experience level (Dan): the higher the Dan, the higher the chance of winning the match! Before a fight, the players that are not attending can predict the winner of that fight to gain prestige.&#10;&#10;The tournament ends with the grand final in which a new champion will be crowned. At the end of the second season the Dojo with most Prestige Points will win the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "The Tesseract appeared in our skies six days ago, over the exact magnetic north of the planet. It was the size of a city block. Since that time it has been condensing, collapsing upon itself.  It can now fit into the palm of your hand.&#10;&#10;Our world&rsquo;s best minds must now find a way to contain and control the reactions of this alien artifact, or its exponentially increasing destructive power will remove our planet from existence, reconfiguring our space and time to the extra-dimensional needs of its creators. Can you and your team work together to shut down the Tesseract, or will humankind simply be a blip in the grand scheme of the universe? Time will tell.&#10;&#10;Tesseract is a compelling, cooperative dice-manipulation game for 1 to 4 players. The focal point of the game is a block of 64 dice, the Tesseract, which sits at the center of the board on a raised platform. Players will remove cubes to place in their individual labs, transfer them as needed to others, adjust the cube's values and, importantly, isolate the cubes into the containment matrix, neutralizing them.&#10;&#10;To Contain a cube a player must have in their lab 3 or more cubes all of one value (a Set) or in sequence (a Run), either all of one color or having none of the same colors. By filling the containment matrix completely (24 total unique dice) they will stop the reaction and win the game. But if the Tesseract has its last cube removed beforehand - or if 7 breaches occur, the game is lost and our world ceases to exist.&#10;&#10;Asymetric character abilities include a passive, 'always on' ability and a unique action that is only available to that player. Research cards earned during play help give players an edge, as do the even more powerful Containment cards, unlocked from the matrix.&#10;&#10;Tesseract is a very challenging co-op game, with lots of replay value built into the number of characters and various threat platforms which govern the difficulty. The game scales remarkably well and has a solo mode that is every bit as engaging. The tension mounts quickly as the Tesseract sheds cubes at the end of every player's turn, primes them and potentially causes Breaches to occur, bringing us closer to disaster.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

Mankind has been forced to seek shelter in underground bases to hide from a constant bombardment of the surface.

    "description": "Monsterpocalypse brings the kaiju (giant monster) genre to the tabletop in the form of an exciting and highly strategic war game.&#10;&#10;Designed by Matt Wilson (I), the award winning creator of Warmachine and Hordes, Monsterpocalypse utilises the critically acclaimed abilities of Privateer Press as a leading miniatures manufacturer to enter a new category of product with a property that will appeal to a world-wide fan base of all ages.&#10;&#10;The players take the role of different factions (dinosaurs, robots, aliens, monsters and so on) fighting with one large (Godzilla size) creature combined with a steady flow of smaller units to support it. The battlefield is a cityscape (poster map) with building models integral to the game's strategy and gameplay. The game uses dice pools of custom dice that are used for both attacking and taking actions, leading to an ebb and flow between monster and unit turns. The goal for both players is to eliminate the monster on the opposing side.&#10;&#10;Monsterpocalypse launched as a CMG in Fall 2008 with the 'Rise' block which consisted of a base set ('Rise') and two expansion sets ('I Chomp NY' and 'All Your Base'), both of which were released in 2009. The second block was released in Fall 2009 with the base set ('Now') and an expansion set ('Big in Japan') in 2010. The last expansion for the 'Now' block has still not been released as of 2015.&#10;&#10;Each set contains large-scale monsters, as well as smaller support units and interactive buildings. Figures were sold in semi-randomized starter packs and randomized booster packs, with limited figures available only through promotional events.&#10;&#10;In 2010 Privateer Press released the Monsterpocalypse 2 Player Battle Box, a semi-randomised set which contained everything 2 players needed to dive right into the game, including two full factions and a complete set of buildings (all from Set 1 'Rise'). In 2011 they also released Monsterpocalypse Dangerous Monster Zone or Monsterpocalypse DMZ for short. These worked as expansion packs for the 2 Player Battle Box, each containing completely fixed, faction specific sets of Set 2 'I Chomp NY' and 3 'All Your Base' miniatures. By buying the DMZs for the factions you got in your  initial battle box you would have 2 complete factions and a full set of buildings from the 'Rise' block, making Monsterpocalypse  much more accessible for newer players in a more non-collectible format.&#10;&#10;",

Essentially, players buy goods, load them onto wagons and send them for maximum profit in other cities.&#10;&#10;The whole game looks very inviting. The medieval cities depicted on the board, together with the player crests, cardboard coins, money pouches, sticker decorated wagons and wooden commodity pieces, immediately creates the right atmosphere for the players.&#10;&#10;There are six cities - Paris, Cologne, Brugge, Gent, Vienna and Genoa - which are interconnected by roads. Three wagons carry goods from one city to another. No-one owns the wagons or controls any of them single-handedly, and in principle a player can put commodities on any transport. There are six different commodities - salt, iron, wine, silk, cloth and food - all of limited supply.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to make money by delivering goods to the towns, and use the money to buy increases in status.  The game ends after a certain number of deliveries have been made and the winner is the player with the highest level of status.&#10;&#10;",

His idea was to use it as a cover to sell alcohol during Prohibition, but the place grew in popularity, and talented artists such as Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, Ethel Waters, and Cab Calloway turned it into a jazz mecca.&#10;&#10;In 1923 Cotton Club, you will oversee a club during the complex times of Prohibition. To smuggle in alcohol, you will have to look for partners in the criminal world and invest money to hire artists and improve your club. All to attract the most important and influential celebrities of the era...&#10;&#10;1923 Cotton Club is played over a maximum of six rounds in which the players can use three pawns to select between different actions: make improvements, ask for a loan, get a tip-off, associate with gangsters, smuggling, hire artists and attract celebrities. All to collect more reputation than all the other clubs in New York! The player with the most reputation points at the end wins.&#10;&#10;",

Players command one or more ships from the Federation, Klingon, Gorn, Romulan, or Kzinti fleets, sporting all of the expected Star Trek weaponry like phasers, disruptor bolts, photon and plasma torpedoes, and tractor beams.  Also includes other weaponry not commonly seen such as drones (homing missiles).&#10;&#10;Players allocate energy and plot movement before each turn, then move all of the ships simultaneously.  Weapons are fired at will during the turn (i.e., not plotted before-hand like movement).  Ships have shields and armor for protection.  When these are breached, various ship systems are damaged, potentially crippling the combat capability of the ship, and eventually resulting in ship destruction.&#10;&#10;Game comes with various scenarios for players to reenact battles from the TV series, or provide for solo play.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;     Star Fleet Battles (Designer's Edition)&#10;     Star Fleet Battles (Commander's Edition)&#10;     Star Fleet Battles Captain&#039;s Edition (Current Edition)&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Each player takes his civilization from early antiquity and learns various technologies, moving progressively to the Middle Ages, the Industrial Revolution, and Modern Times and ending with today's Internet or Social Welfare.&#10;&#10;Unlike other civilization games, Progress focuses on a single aspect of civilization building: researching technologies that help a society advance. The 210 technology cards in the game are divided into three ages (Ancient, Middle Ages, Industrial) and three types (Military, Science and Culture). With every advancement on a path, you gain easier access to its more advanced technologies and you'll end up opening the door to the next age.&#10;&#10;Each tech card provides one bonus, which can vary from one extra knowledge to a larger hand size. Even though most tech cards in the game come in multiple copies (usually one per player), the key technologies occur less frequently, forcing players to specialize and granting them unique advantages. Every technology you research decreases the cost of up to three more advanced technologies, accelerating the race towards the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The game play is streamlined, with players usually taking two actions, thus making each turn short and ensuring that you use the time when the others are playing for planning rather than seeing it as downtime.&#10;&#10;",

As the old saying goes, the taller the tower, the more influential the family.&#10;&#10;Players are master builders trying to profit from these vanity-driven families. You build these towers floor by floor, ready to take credit for making them look good. From Mayfair&rsquo;s description of the game: &ldquo;You must shrewdly accept the building orders of the patrician families to position yourself in the right place at the right time. Play your cards right, and your name will be famous among the rich and powerful!&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Patrician comes with 149 wooden tower pieces, 55 building cards, 20 prestige tokens, and a double-sided playing board.&#10;&#10;The board represents a number of cities, each of which will have 2 towers when the games ends.  Players have a hand of 3 cards, each indicating one city.  Playing a card allows that player to add a tower piece to the city indicated by the card.  Each city will have a specific number of tower pieces.  When the specified number of pieces are played to the city, the city is complete.  The player with the most pieces in each of the two towers will score points when the city is completed. The player replaces the played card by taking the card from the city where he played a tower piece.  As long as the city in uncompleted, a new card is added to the city to replace the one taken by the player.&#10;&#10;In addition to indicating a city, cards have one of 4 secondary functions.  They can have one or two Portraits from an influential family.  They can add a second tower piece to the same city. they can allow the player to move the top piece from one tower in any other city where the player has at least one tower piece, to the top of the other tower in that same city. Finally, a card may allow the player to take a replacement card from any of the cities, not just the one where the player has added a tower piece.  All cards played are kept by the player.  At the end of the game, additional points are awarded for every complete set of 3 portraits from the influential families.&#10;&#10;The game ends when all cities are completed, which will also be when all cards have been played.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to be the most successful builder, indicated by having the most points.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Key Market is the sixth game in the Key series of stand-alone games published by R&amp;D Games set in the medieval lands of Keydom, with components in both English and German.&#10;&#10;The game is designed by David Brain, who was a playtester on some of the earlier Key games.  The game is the first game published by R&amp;D Games that has not been designed by Richard Breese.  Richard this time takes on the role of developer and the game consequently has the same look and feel as the previous Key games, with artwork again by Juliet Breese plus its own set of ani-/vegi-/arti-meeples.&#10;&#10;Each player controls an extended family of workers.  Over the course of two years, players will organise their workers in an attempt to turn their initial scanty resources into a thriving economic system.&#10;&#10;After an initial set up phase, the game is played over eight seasons.  Each season has three distinct phases, during which players may take a variety of actions.  The topography, weather, and seasons will influence the ability of workers to produce crops and livestock in the fields and luxuries in the villages.  In addition, resources and luxuries may be bought and sold in the market, or gold and favours sought and acquired.  Other workers may be sponsored to join the powerful guilds, where they will acquire skills as they gain promotion to become craftsmen or even the guild master.&#10;&#10;Turn order throughout the game is determined by the player&rsquo;s position on the season track, which changes at the end of each season.  At the end of the game, the player who has acquired the most gold will win the game.&#10;&#10;David Brain&rsquo;s designer notes on the box sides conclude by stating that &lsquo;Key Market is a reasonably intricate game.  Some of the strategies that can be employed (particularly the effective use of the market) are not immediately apparent, and some of the Guild combinations do not look so devastating at first glance.  But for those looking for a challenging medieval resource management/economic engine game, here you are.&rsquo;&#10;&#10;The game is for two to four players, with a game time of approximately 30 minutes plus 30 minutes per player.&#10;&#10;Key Market was released at the Essen Spiel in October 2010 as a limited edition of 900 copies. The game was reprinted in 2019.&#10;&#10;",

She herself has only just survived a mighty war against Persia.  Both empires now lay exhausted from their long years of struggle.  Meanwhile, further south in the deserts of Arabia, the prophet Mohamed has given new meaning to an old religion and sets the peoples of that land on a course of action which will echo down the ages.  Under the leadership of a succession of caliphs the Islamic Arabs are about to descend on the prostrate bodies of the Persian and Byzantine empires.&#10;&#10;From the box:&#10;&#10;The game 'Byzantium' deals with the rise of the Muslim Caliphate and its war with the Byzantine Empire.

So what are you waiting for?&#10;&#10;How to play&#10;&#10;     Scan: The DJ scans the card using the HITSTER app and follows the on-screen instructions. A song should start playing.&#10;     Place: Position the music card: The player to the left of the DJ positions the card face down (without peeking at the underside) in the correct spot on their timeline by placing it to the left/right or in between the other music cards in front of them, with the earliest song on their left.&#10;     Flip: Flip the music card: If it is in the correct position, they get to keep the card. Otherwise, discard it unless another player has correctly placed a HITSTER token. Cards of the same year can be in either order, even when that song was released earlier in that year. Now the DJ plays a new song and it&rsquo;s the next player&rsquo;s turn.&#10;     Win: Play continues to the left until one of the players has 10 cards correctly positioned in their timeline.

What they find there, what conclusions they draw from these items, and how this nerve-wracking story ends is entirely in their hands. Only by co-ordinating their team will they avoid potential pitfalls, carry out their mission, and solve the mystery of this building.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Somewhere on a doomed and distant planet, life has emerged, competing for supremacy until the world&rsquo;s inevitable destruction. The object of the game is to score the most points by the time the world ends. Score points by playing Traits for your Doomlings&rsquo; species, making them more adaptable, resilient, and mischievous. As your Doomlings assert their dominance, Catastrophes will befall the planet, causing setbacks for each competing species. When the third Catastrophe inevitably strikes, the world ends, and the Doomlings with the strongest set of traits gets to look the Apocalypse in the eye and declare&hellip;&ldquo;I scored the most points!&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Throughout the game, players draw Trait cards from a community pile, and then play them for points. Traits can also have special abilities and bonuses, allowing players to build a wide range of winning combinations. The game is played in rounds, using Age cards, which have different rules that players must follow. But be warned, hidden in the Ages are Catastrophes: special rounds with adverse effects that force players to adapt their strategy.&#10;&#10;Doomlings adds a fun twist to hand management, by introducing the &ldquo;Gene Pool&rdquo; mechanic. Your Gene Pool is your hand size: it is unique to you, and it can increase or decrease through special Traits, or even Catastrophes. Doomlings includes 6 colorful Gene Pool counter cards, elegantly tracking how many cards you should hold at the end of your turn. There are opportunities to increase your Gene Pool (hand size), which can give your species a leg up by providing a larger pool of Traits to select from each turn.&#10;&#10;A lightweight card game for 2-6 players, Doomlings can be played casually amongst friends, or competitively by the gaming enthusiast family. Because there are no duplicate cards, and Age cards are chosen randomly, no two games are ever the same. While the game itself can be learned in 5 minutes or less, don&rsquo;t be fooled: with 100+ unique Traits&mdash;in Red, Blue, Green, Purple and Colorless&mdash;and rare, powerful Dominant Traits, there are countless combinations of play to be discovered.&#10;&#10;A typical game takes between 20-45 minutes, depending on the number of players and sequence of events. Advanced-play expansion packs are also available, including a Hidden Objective expansion for a fun twist to the game. Doomlings requires no dice or additional pieces, just a jolly embrace of the inevitable end of the world!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

So we printed out all of the RCG panels and started playing with them.&quot;&#10;&#10;Draw 7 cards. The deck plays the first card, select a Judge to play the second, then everyone selects a third card to create a three panel comic strip.

    "description": "Patchwork Express features the same basic gameplay as Patchwork, but with a smaller playing area and with larger and less complex pieces.&#10;&#10;In the game, each player tries to build the most aesthetic (and high-scoring) patchwork quilt on a personal 7x7 game board. To start play, lay out all of the light-colored patches at random in a circle and place a starting marker in a particular location. Each player takes some buttons &mdash; the currency/points in the game &mdash; and someone is chosen as the start player.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player either purchases one of the three patches standing clockwise of the starting marker or passes. To purchase a patch, you pay the cost in buttons shown on the patch, move the starting marker to that patch's location in the circle, add the patch to your game board, then advance your time token on the time track a number of spaces equal to the time shown on the patch. You're free to place the patch anywhere on your board that doesn't overlap other patches, but you probably want to fit things together as tightly as possible. If your time token is behind or on top of the other player's time token, then you take another turn; otherwise the opponent now goes. Instead of purchasing a patch, you can choose to pass; to do this, you move your time token to the space immediately in front of the opponent's time token, then take one button from the bank for each space you moved.&#10;&#10;In addition to a button cost and time cost, each patch also features 0-3 buttons, and when you move your time token past a button on the time track, you earn &quot;button income&quot;: sum the number of buttons depicted on your personal game board, then take this many buttons from the bank.&#10;&#10;What's more, the time track depicts six 1x1 patches on it, and during set-up you place six actual 1x1 patches on these spaces. Whoever first passes a patch on the time track claims this patch and immediately places it on their game board.&#10;&#10;At some point during the game, dark-colored patches are added to what's available for players to take, and these pieces are smaller than the light-colored ones, making it more likely that they'll fill in holes on a player's board.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Phantom Leader &ndash; Solitaire&#10;&#10;What&rsquo;s New in the Deluxe Edition?&#10;We have expanded and updated the original Phantom Leader game to the high standard set by our Hornet Leader game.&#10;&#10;Increase the cards from 165 to 330 &#10;- All pilots get all 6 experience levels &#10;- Add new aircraft: Air Force F-5, Air Force A-7 &#10;- Add more pilots for all aircraft types &#10;- Add more Target cards &#10;- Add more Special Event cards &#10;- Revise the 6 original Campaigns to include the new Targets and Aircraft&#10;&#10;Add Air Force and Navy Campaigns for the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis&#10;&#10;Upgrade to a mounted 11&quot;x17&quot; Tactical Display&#10;&#10;Description:&#10;Phantom Leader places you in command of a US Air Force or US Navy Tactical Fighter squadron in Vietnam between 1964 and 1972. You must not only destroy the targets but you must also balance the delicate political repercussions of your attacks. If you strike too hard, your air offensive might be put on hold, strike to light, and you&rsquo;ll be blamed for losing the war.&#10;&#10;Welcome to the Vietnam Air War!&#10;&#10;Each of the campaigns can be played with either an Air Force or Navy squadron. The targets assigned to each service are different and change the complexion of the campaigns. Each campaign can be played with three different durations of: Skirmish, Conflict, or War.&#10;&#10;Each mission takes roughly 30 minutes to set-up, plan, and resolve.&#10;&#10;Each of your pilots has their own skills. Selecting the right pilots and weapons for a mission is vital to its success. As you fly missions, your pilots will gain experience and fatigue. With experience, their skills improve, but as their fatigue increases, their skills decrease and they might not be able to fly for several missions.&#10;&#10;For those of you familiar with our modern era Hornet Leader series of games, you might be wondering what&rsquo;s different about Phantom Leader&hellip;&#10;&#10;The freedom of being able to select the best mission based on military objectives is something that is commonplace for today&rsquo;s military. Back in Vietnam, the military was responsible for carrying out their orders, while at the same time being extremely limited in the weapons and tactics they were allowed to use to complete those orders. In many cases, the specific weapons, approach paths, and bombing altitudes were generated target-by-target at the White House. The mission specifics were then sent down the chain of command to the individual pilots flying the mission. As you can imagine, this was not the best way to run an air campaign.&#10;&#10;Every target has a Political value. If you destroy it, you move the Political counter to the right a number of spaces equal to its value. As the counter gets moved to the right, your future target choices are reduced to those that are less politically sensitive. Which target you choose not to attack is also important. You get to move the Political counter to the left a number of spaces equal its Political value.&#10;&#10;This means that while you might like to flatten a big enemy target and rack up the victory points, it might be better for you to choose a pointless target and move the Political counter in your favor instead.&#10;&#10;Another difference is in combat power. For the last couple decades, the US Air Force and Navy have enjoyed air superiority due to training and technology. Such was not the case in the skies over Vietnam. The enemy had different, but just as capable, equipment. They also had the training and will to use it to its utmost.&#10;&#10;They soon became aware of the limitations placed on the US forces by the politicians, and used those limitations to their advantage.&#10;&#10;For example, at times, US pilots were not permitted to fire on enemy aircraft until they were visually identified. This negated any range advantage conveyed by the radar-homing AIM-7 Sparrow missiles. It was also a common limitation that enemy aircraft could only be attacked in the air. US pilots were not allowed to attack enemy airbases. US aircraft were also limited to flying predictable flight paths, at set times. This made setting up ambushes much easier for the enemy.&#10;&#10;So, while you might be a Hornet Leader ace, Vietnam is a whole different ballgame!&#10;&#10;",

Players will set up the game by placing these 5 boxes, plus the box bottom, onto the scroll in designated areas. This creates the environment that players will explore and battle across.&#10;&#10;In Tiny Epic Tactics, players will have a team of four unique heroes: a Fighter, a Wizard, a Rogue and a Beast. Each hero type, and each character within that type, offers unique advantages to movement, attacks, and/or support. Finding the synergy in your team is key to victory.&#10;&#10;In competitive play, players will pit their teams against one another in effort to score the most victory points by the end of the game. Each turn, players will have three actions to assign across their team. They can move and/or attack with their heroes. Victory points are rewarded for area control, enemy heroes captured, and keeping your own heroes alive. Gaining complete control of one, or multiple, specific areas offers the most victory points in competitive play. Gaining control of said areas requires your heroes maintaining majority presence in these areas over the course of a few turns. This requires a careful balance of offense and defense. The control of these areas can easily shift from one player to another based on which player has the majority heroes present in the designated spaces. Once a set number of areas are captured, or one of the players has lost all of their heroes, the end game is triggered.&#10;&#10;Tiny Epic Tactics offers a distinctly different experience for solo and cooperative play. In these modes, players will adventure across the map, fighting spawning enemies and exploring caves (printed on the interior of each of the boxes). The goal is to acquire treasures, that belongs to the enemy, from these caves while keeping your heroes alive. Once the end of the game is triggered, victory points are tallied based on how many treasures you took from the enemy and how many of your heroes you kept alive.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Astoria is a land pulsing with magic and intrigue! A handful of Arch-Mages are vying for the loyalty of wizards across the land so that they can wield ultimate power.&#10;&#10;Lizard Wizard is a game from the team that brought you Raccoon Tycoon.  Aspects of gameplay will be familiar to fans of RT, and will add a bit of extra depth and strategy.&#10;&#10;In Lizard Wizard, players compete to recruit wizards from seven unique schools of magic, build mystical towers, research powerful spells, summon helpful familiars, and search dark dungeons for gold and items of power. Only one Arch-Mage will rise above the rest and control the land. Will it be you?&#10;&#10; &#10;Actions&#10; Lizard Wizard is an action-selection game. On a player&rsquo;s turn, they may perform one of the following six Actions:&#10;&#10;&#10;1)    GATHER REAGENTS&#10;Just as there are seven schools of magic, there are seven magical reagents, or ingredients, that fuel the magic of Astoria. Knowing where these natural wonders can be found is the essential starting point for every young wizard. Sometimes they use familiars to perform this errand, but it is still very common to find even the most powerful arch-mages lurking in the Enchanted Wood, searching for the most pure reagents.&#10;&#10;     Play a Gather Reagents Card&#10;     Take Reagents shown on the &lsquo;Gather Reagents&rsquo; half (plus any on your Wizard Cards)&#10;     Increase the value of the Reagents shown on the &lsquo;Increase Value&rsquo; half&#10;     Cast one spell (if you have the necessary reagents)&#10;&#10;&#10; &#10;2)    CONVERT REAGENTS TO MANA&#10;Long ago, the wizards of Astoria learned how to convert reagents into mana, the magical energy that powers all things. The process is no longer dangerous, but it still takes great focus and knowledge.&#10;&#10;     Turn in one type of reagents to the supply&#10;     Gain Mana = Value of that Reagent x Tokens turned in&#10;     Reduce the Value of that Reagent by the number of Tokens turned in&#10;&#10;&#10; &#10;3)    RECRUIT WIZARD&#10;The Arch Mages of Astoria are vying for ultimate power, which can only be achieved by drawing several lesser wizards into their circle of influence. They do this through demonstrations of their magical ability. Occasionally, their attempts to recruit a wizard are challenged by one or more rivals, and a Wizard&rsquo;s Duel occurs. These contests of magical power can drain even the most powerful mage.&#10;&#10;     Select one of the two Wizard Cards on offer and bid Mana in turn (or pass)&#10;     Winner of the Auction pays the bid and takes the Wizard Card&#10;     If the player who started the Auction didn&rsquo;t win, they may take another Action&#10;&#10;&#10; &#10;4)    RESEARCH SPELL &#10;Arch-Mages have the ability to learn spells from any of the seven schools of magic. Once they have researched a new spell, it still must be cast with reagents (and the help of a familiar) before it takes effect.&#10;&#10;     Select a Spell Card from the four on offer and pay 5 Mana&#10;     Place the Spell Card face down in front of you&#10;     Cast the Spell if you have the necessary Reagents&#10;&#10;&#10; &#10;5)    CREATE A TOWER &#10;Magical Towers amplify the power of wizards of each school of magic. Towers may be created through powerful magic, or built by workers who must be paid.&#10;&#10;     Pay either the Reagents or the Gold shown on the Tower Card on offer&#10;     Take the Tower Card and place it in front of you&#10;     Towers add &lsquo;1&rsquo; to your storage for Reagents&#10;&#10;&#10; &#10;6)    SUMMON FAMILIAR: &#10;Familiars are magical spirits that are summoned and inhabit the bodies of mortal creatures. They are essential servants who perform many vital services for wizards: They can be used for simple errands, such as gathering reagents or gold. They are the only ones who can locate the ever-shifting entrance to the famous Dungeons of Astoria. They are also essential assistants in the complex rituals required to cast spells.&#10;Use the Card for one of four purposes:&#10;    a) Score one School of Magic (2 Gold/ Card of the same School of Magic as the Familiar)&#10;    b) Gather Reagents shown on the Familiar Card and Cast any number of Spells &#10;    c) Clear the Spell Offer, Replace them with four new Spell Cards and select one for free&#10;    d) Enter the Dungeon&#10;&#10;     Draw cards from the top of the Dungeon Deck, stopping when you want&#10;     Monster Cards &lsquo;hit&rsquo;; 2 hits = failure&#10;     If you stop before failure, keep the treasure cards and shuffle the monster cards back into the Dungeon Deck&#10;     If you fail, shuffle all drawn cards back into the Dungeon Deck&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;End Game and Scoring&#10;&#10;The game will end when any one of the following decks is depleted: Familiar, Tower, Wizard, Spell.&#10;&#10;When the game ends, the players will score points for each Wizard and Tower Card combo (10 VP if they are of the same school of magic, and 5 VP if they are not), 3 VP for each Spell Card in schools of magic where they have a matching Wizard and Tower, 1 VP for each Gold gathered from the dungeon or from scoring with a Familiar Card, and any points derived from the special abilities from spells.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "B-17 Flying Fortress Leader is a WWII strategic bombing solitaire game that takes place in the European Theater of Operations (ETO).&#10;&#10;In B-17 Leader, you are in command of the Eighth Air Force stationed in England, charged with reducing Germany's ability to wage war.  Your primary mission is to destroy the Luftwaffe to ensure a successful D-Day landing, but multiple secondary missions are also required to help advance the fronts in multiple theaters.&#10;&#10;You will have multiple historic Bomber Groups composed of B-17 Flying Fortresses, B-24 Liberators, and B-26 Marauders.  Optional B-29 Superfortress and B-25 Mitchell Bomber Groups are included.  Your Bomber Groups will be protected on their journey in Luftwaffe controlled airspace by Fighter Groups composed of MK VII Spitfires, P-47 Thunderbolts, P-38 Lightnings, and P-51 Mustangs.   Your groups can progress in experience levels from Newbie to Ace, but may be Reassigned as they gain experience.  Optional Renown Commanders provide groups with special skills and tactics, but could be killed during the Campaign.&#10;&#10;The campaigns included in B-17 Leader include:&#10;  &bull; The Air War Begins (Aug 1942 &ndash; Dec 1942)&#10;  &bull; Operation Pointblank (June 1943 &ndash; May 1944)&#10;  &bull; Combined Bomber Operations (June 1943 &ndash; Sept 1943)&#10;  &bull; Allied Invasion (June 1944 &ndash; May 1945)&#10;  &bull; Oil Campaign (Aug 1944 &ndash; Nov 1944)&#10;  &bull; Operation Argument &ndash; Big Week (Feb 20 &ndash; 25 1944)&#10;  &bull; Operation Crossbow (Mar 1943 &ndash; May 1943)&#10;  &bull; Transportation (Apr 1944 &ndash; Aug 1944)&#10;  &bull; Strategic Targets (Jun 1943 - Aug 1943)&#10;  &bull; U-Boat Focus (Aug 1942)&#10;  &bull; Aircraft Industry Focus (Aug 1943)&#10;&#10;You will be targeting many different types of targets, including Airfields, Aircraft Factories, U-Boat Pens, Ball Bearing Factories, Oil Refineries, and V-Weapon sites.  Recon Aircraft can be sent to improve your aim point and allow you to pick the optimal path to reduce Flak damage.&#10;&#10;Opposing you will be Luftwaffe Squadrons, generated from multiple Aircraft Factories, that will intercept your Escorts and Bombers to and from the targets.  Luftwaffe Squadron Bandits can be BF-109s, FW-190s, BF-110s, and/or ME-410s.  Targeting their Aircraft Factories will reduce the number of new Luftwaffe Squadrons deployed each month, but destroyed factories are quickly rebuilt, and new Aircraft Factories are periodically being added.  Attacking and destroying Airfields helps reduce the number of deployed Luftwaffe Squadrons.  Victory Points are earned for each destroyed Target.&#10;&#10;Various German Defense Commanders will try different tactics and technologies in an effort to stop your campaign.  Each German commander will also have a varying range of Luftwaffe responses to your attack, from Poor to All Out.&#10;&#10;To help mitigate the Luftwaffe threat, you can accomplish Secondary Mission objectives that can advance the Mediterranean and Russian fronts to force Germany to send more Luftwaffe Squadrons into those theaters.  You can also purchase various technologies to increase the odds of a successful mission, like Drop Tanks, Jammers, and H2X Radar sets.  An option to invest and field the P-80 Shooting Star jet fighter is included.    Once the Allied Invasion has begun, many Secondary Missions will help advance the Allies to Berlin to end the war.&#10;&#10;Your Bombers will take damage and be destroyed, but monthly Replenishment units will help bring your groups up in strength.&#10;&#10;If you have played other Leader Games, many aspects of B-17 Leader will be familiar.  But due to the Strategic nature of your bombing campaign, new gameplay aspects are introduced.&#10;&#10;",
