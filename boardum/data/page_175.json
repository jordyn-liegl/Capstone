    "description": "More than three millennia have passed since the human race left its native land. The discovery of the Sophia triad made real some theories previously thought impossible, theories that were experimented to prove their viability and each of them were performed, no matter whether it was possible or not.&#10;&#10;Dark Matter is a game from 2 to 4 players. Each player starts with three unique cards to play all the game. Each card is divided in two zones in its obverse and reverse, and each zone has one or several skills. Players play these skills to get matters to terraform planets, to recruit soldiers, to attack enemy planets, to improve their own planets, to use heroes and politics to manipulate their cards and opponents cards, to get resources, and more.&#10;&#10;But players won't play only with their own cards. They can also use the opponent cards. Each time a card is played it changes its position, so possibilities are infinite. When a player uses his cards, he spins his card (from front to back) and when he uses the opponent cards, they flip the card (from up to down). In this way, new matters and skills are available to play more actions.&#10;&#10;Get victory points controlling planets and use them to get more resource gems, soldiers or skills. Recruit a huge army gives also victory points and it helps to get enemy resource from their planets. All this with only three cards in hand. Impossible? Try it out!&#10;&#10;&#10;Han pasado m&aacute;s de tres milenios desde que la humanidad abandonase su Tierra natal.  El descubrimiento de la Tr&iacute;ada Sophia ha logrado que teor&iacute;as cient&iacute;ficas imposibles de demostrar no s&oacute;lo se pudieran experimentar para vislumbrar su veracidad, sino que cada una de ellas se pudieran llevar a cabo.  Tanto si eran posibles, como si no.&#10;&#10;Dark Matter es un juego para 2 a 4 jugadores.  Cada jugador recibe al principio de la partida 3 &uacute;nicas cartas que ser&aacute;n con las que juegue toda la partida. Cada carta est&aacute; dividida en dos partes tanto por su anverso como por su reverso.  Cada una de esas partes tiene una o varias habilidades que los jugadores podr&aacute;n activar para generar materias con las que terraformar planetas, reclutar soldados para atacar los planetas enemigos, mejorar sus propios planetas, utilizar h&eacute;roes y pol&iacute;ticos para manipular sus cartas y las de los contrarios, generar recursos, etc.&#10;&#10;En su turno, cada jugador puede utilizar la habilidad de la parte superior de sus cartas que &eacute;l vea y las partes superiores de las cartas de los dem&aacute;s jugadores que vea (los anversos).  Cuando un jugador utiliza una de sus cartas, le da la vuelta en la mano, quedando la habilidad que ha utilizado a la vista de los dem&aacute;s jugadores, que podr&aacute;n usarla en sus turnos.  A la vez, si un jugador utiliza una de las cartas de sus oponentes, girar&aacute; la carta en la mano de su oponente quedando la parte superior en la inferior.&#10;&#10;Adicionalmente cada jugador puede usar las habilidades que le otorgan sus planetas terraformados y las habilidades de los dem&aacute;s planetas controlados por los oponentes, enviando a sus soldados.  Al final de la cuarta ronda de juego, el jugador con m&aacute;s puntos de victoria ser&aacute; el ganador y due&ntilde;o de la galaxia.&#10;&#10;",

You are samurai on a quest to become supreme military commander of Japan. To do this, you must defeat the other player by eliminating their 4 armor and 4 health tokens.&#10;&#10;Use cards to inflict damage and defend. When taking a turn, you may attack by playing an offensive card. To defend, play a card with a defensive value and subtract it from the attack value to determine if the hit landed.&#10;&#10;After taking an action, you may play an action card face down. This is your defensive stance during your opponent's turn. When you opponent takes an action, you may reveal your stance card. However, if your opponent chooses to attack, your stance will break and any benefit to be gained from it will be lost.&#10;&#10;Divine beings and forces of nature called kami provide crucial support in battle. Every kami possesses two abilities: an active one that requires playing a purify card and a passive ability that is &quot;always on.&quot; Not only do kami provide game-changing special powers, they can be called upon to sacrifice themselves in kamikaze attacks that inflict massive damage (crab bosses beware). Each time you activate a kami power, though, you must draw a shrine card. A mixture of good and bad events, shrine cards are yet another element of risk to think about when considering use of kami powers.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "The card game Elfer raus! Extra &mdash; which was first released as Elfer raus! Master &mdash; uses the same basic game play as the decades old Elfer raus, but adds a few twists. The game is played using a deck of 103 cards, consisting of:&#10;&#10;&#10;    84 number cards, numbered 1 to 21 in four colors;&#10;    15 connection cards;&#10;    4 jokers.&#10;&#10;&#10;There are also seven bonus cards used in scorekeeping.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, the eleven of each color is placed in the middle of the table in a column. The other number cards and the jokers are shuffled together, and each player receives a number of those cards as well as a number of connection cards. The goal of the game is to play all of your number and joker cards by building a grid &ndash; four rows, each from one to twenty-one.&#10;&#10;Each turn, you may play up to four cards from your hand. If you cannot play a card, or don't want to, you draw one card from the draw pile. The cards must be played according to the following rules:&#10;&#10;    You must place a number card next to a card that is one higher or lower of the same color and that is already on the table. So, the red twelve must be placed next to the red eleven, and the red thirteen must be placed next to the red twelve (or in front of the red fourteen). So, the red thirteen cannot be played if neither the twelve nor the fourteen has been played unless you use a connection card.&#10;    Alternatively, you can use a connection card to place a card above or below a card with the same number and a different color. For example, if the green row is above the yellow row, and the green nine has already been played, you may use a connection card to play the yellow nine in the yellow row. The connection cards are not part of your hand, so they don't count toward the maximum of four cards that you may play during a round.&#10;    A joker may be placed instead of any other number cards. If a player has a number card whose spot is occupied by a joker, he may exchange that card for the joker.&#10;&#10;&#10;If a player completes a segment from one to eleven or from eleven to twenty-one, he receives a bonus card.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player has played the last card from his hand. Then, points are counted:&#10;&#10;    Each bonus card is worth 11 points.&#10;    Each number card that a player still holds is worth as many minus points as its value.&#10;    Each joker that a player still holds is worth 11 minus points.&#10;&#10;&#10;The player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;",

Other players rival you for absolute mastery. He who completes his device first and collects the highest ransom is declared the winner &mdash; and ruler of the world!&#10;&#10;Players choose the doomsday device that they intend to build - keeping it hidden from their opponents until they are ready to unleash it on an unsuspecting humanity. They build up the resources needed to activate the machine by playing and drawing cards whilst using minion cards to steal resources from other players and protect their own.&#10;&#10;Once a player's device is ready they can threaten a city with it. If the city surrenders the player will gain resources towards building the next stage of their machine. If the city refuses to surrender then the player has to choose the humiliation of backing down or to activate the machine - thus destroying it.&#10;&#10;Each stage of the machine has a grander target, the winner is the player who forces the whole world to surrender.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "What do the pears cost?&#10;Do I still have enough money for tomatoes?&#10;The most skillful shopper goes home first with a full shopping bag.&#10;In this game children are introduced to shopping. They practice handling goods and money, learn to compare prices and take important steps towards their independence.&#10;&#10;Children must be able to count to four and compare numbers.&#10;&#10;Each player receives a shopping list showing 4 different goods and a purse with maximal 8 coins. In turns, players throw a dice yielding a number between 2 and 4, and move on ways between a common home, the bank and the four shops. The home is the starting place, the shops allow purchases and the bank allows to refill the purse. The first player to return home with all 4 goods on his shopping list purchased wins. Very simple.&#10;&#10;There are 9 different shopping goods: 3 meat products, 3 bakery products and 3 fruit/vegetable products. There are four copies of each product in the game. The butcher/bakery/greengrocery hold three copies of each meat/bakery/veggie product respectively and one copy of each product is found at the delicatessen shop.&#10;&#10;Out of its stock of 9 goods per shop, only three are on display and up for sale at a time. Goods cost between 1 and 3 coins each, depending on its display slot, clearly marked by a price tag showing coins above each good. Upon purchase, all remaining goods a shifted to the left (the cheap places) and new goods from the stock fill up the empty expensive places on the right.&#10;&#10;This may sound more complicated than it is: a three year old easily understands it and can execute the simple mechanic, thanks to arrows and price tags showing coins and not numbers. What a three year old that is yet unfamiliar with boardgames might not immediately appreciate, is the neat balancing behind the mechanic: unsold products decrease in price, whereas sought-after products increase in price; that buying bread at the delicatessen is more expensive than at the bakery, both in terms of money and distance to travel, but that the delicatessen may save travel between different shops, etc. However, learning this by playing is the hidden educational goal of the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "&quot;Cradle of Civilization&quot; is a two wargames in one pack that allows players to determine the fate of the ancient near east. In one game civilizations rise while in the other players battle over whether the great Persian Empire will survive. Both games emphasize simplicity but not at the price of being unrealistic.&#10;&#10;From Sumeria to Persia is about the Bronze and Iron Age, when civilization was born and city states went from kingdoms and finally to large empires, culminating in the Persian Empire founded by Cyrus the Great. Players of History of the World will recognize the base mechanics whereby players randomly select civilizations from cards, although the player in last place has more power to decide which civilization they will play.&#10;&#10;From Sumeria to Persia does offer players more options than previous games on the subject. Civilizations that survive can continue to expand in future turns. Random events create possibilities that defy history but were in the realm of possibility. The Minoans may have a brilliant military commander and the Egyptians could become a seafaring empire. There are also rules for constructing wonders, the placement of cities, and the general effects of the Bronze Age collapse. Lastly, the Persian Empire does appear.&#10;&#10;Alexander vs. Darius: The Fall of the Persian Empire simulates Alexander III&rsquo;s conquest of the great Persian Empire. Sometimes portrayed as a foregone conclusion, this game argues that Persia certainly had a chance to win if they had used different strategies or had some luck on the battlefield. Darius III need not have been Persia&rsquo;s last king.&#10;&#10;The heart of Alexander vs. Darius is a war weariness track, which moves down steadily for Alexander&rsquo;s army. Historically, it did not reach zero until after his invasion of India, but a Persian battlefield victory could have changed that. The game also allows players to explore Memnon&rsquo;s strategy of using Persian naval supremacy to raid Alexander&rsquo;s rear as well as exploring the possibilities of the Spartan rebellion. Lastly, the Persians themselves must worry about legitimacy, and therefore must be active in resisting Alexander, or risk losing their grip on the throne.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Pond is a combinatorial abstract game similar to Tak and Go. Players place, move, and transform pieces on a square grid to create connected lines of matching symbols. Pieces are removed from the board and scored when matches are made.&#10;&#10;Each piece is three-sided, and when transformed, pieces always advance through the three faces in the same order: Egg to Tadpole to Frog to Egg. Each face has unique movement rules. Because pieces can't transform in the backwards direction, players are never able to simply reverse their opponent's previous transformation.&#10;&#10;One player uses light pieces, and the other dark. When matching pieces are removed from the board, each player scores their own pieces from the set, regardless of which player created the set. The ability to score for yourself and your opponent creates asymmetrical incentives in otherwise symmetrical board states.&#10;&#10;Pond takes 2 minutes to learn and about 10 minutes to play. It can be played in the 4x4 &quot;small&quot; (&#229;&#176;&#143;) pond for a shorter game with tight quarters, or in the 5x5 &quot;big&quot; (&#229;&#164;&#167;) pond for a longer, more open game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "In this highly abstract strategic wargame, you are trying to conquer China by being the first to occupy fifteen provinces at the completion of a complete round of play (all players having had an equal number of turns).  Alternatively, the game can be timed and scored.&#10;&#10;You start with a small number of provinces under your control.  Population counters of your colour indicate this; if a province has extra population, it can move some into an adjacent unoccupied province --this is the simplest way of conquest.  Merger, diplomacy and force (Risk-like combat) are your other options.  Each turn you draw a Yin card and a Yang card.  Yin is bad, Yang is good.  Without looking at either card's instructions, you assign them to two of your provinces.  Yang will most likely increase your recruitment (which is normally three population per turn), but could also give you the capability to cross a natural barrier like a mountain range.  Yin will hurt you.  Some cards you end up holding in your hand.&#10;&#10;A player may attempt to convince another player to merge with his empire.  If the second player agrees then the smaller empire is absorbed by the larger and both players continue play as senior (larger) and junior (smaller) partners.  The absorbed empire no longer has a separate turn nor separate recruitment.  This concept of &quot;shared victory&quot; is intriguing, particularly with a larger number of players.&#10;&#10;The game allows any number of players but components are only provided for five.&#10;&#10;",

Additionally, wizards can invoke the highest power, the Wizard&rsquo;s Gambit, to thwart other wizard competitors and increase their chance of claiming powerful Spells for their own.&#10;&#10;Each Spell has a point value, which adds up cumulatively to represent their Spell Book&rsquo;s score. The first wizard to reach a Spell point total of ten (10) points wins the game and is proclaimed Grand Siege Magus.&#10;&#10;Wizard's Gambit is a light-hearted game for the casual gamer and for family play.&#10;&#10;",

Dinosaur and action cards have different backs, so the player knows what type of card he draws, but not which card exactly. If she draws a dinosaur card, she places it face-up in front of her. If she draws an action card, she may be able to take a second turn, steal from another player, or force an exchange of one bone for another; she may also be forced to discard a card, or she might end up with a rock, which is placed back in the dig area for everyone to work around. When a player has four cards of the same dinosaur, she groups them as a set; these cards cannot be lost or stolen.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the final dinosaur card is collected. Players score 1, 3, 6 or 10 points for a set of 1-4 dinosaur cards of the same type, and the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

On a turn, you do the following:&#10;&#10;&#10;         Draw: Draw the top card from the deck and add it to your hand.&#10;         Play: Choose one of the two cards in hand to play and place it face up in front of you.&#10;         Effect: Carry out the played card's effect, after which the card is considered as discarded.&#10;         End: Throughout gameplay you're trying to eliminate other players or uncover the location of the &quot;Lost Legacy&quot; card; this card might also be in the &quot;Ruins&quot;, a location that holds one card at the start of the game and possibly acquires more cards during play. When someone discovers the Lost Legacy, the game ends, everyone tallies the value of the cards they've played and the card left in hand, and whoever has the highest total wins.&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;By combining different Lost Legacy sets (while keeping only a single Lost Legacy card in play), up to six players can compete at the same time.&#10;&#10;",

The miniatures, which represent arena combat robots, are actually 5&quot; action figures with 14 points of articulation and 8 pieces of removable armor. Each piece of armor has a corresponding collectible card giving its statistics and special powers. Each basic set includes a fixed 10 card set (1 card per piece of equipment, including the figure itself, plus a character card)&#10;&#10;The game is played in rounds, which start with all players choosing which 3 pieces of equipment to use this round. Each piece of equipment also has an impulse rating, and whoever has the highest impulse goes first. Players then use their cards to move their figure a number of card lengths and/or use attacks based on a color-matching system on the ends of each card. If your attack is successful, a piece of your opponent's armor is destroyed (and so is its corresponding card).&#10;&#10;One of the more innovative parts in all this is that the actual figure poses have bearing on gameplay. Movement points must be used to enter a stance, and each stance has certain advantages and disadvantages (Except lying down, which is universally bad)&#10;&#10;Z-G was first shown publicly for sale and demonstration at Origins 2001 in Columbus, Ohio, with the subtitle &quot;Citizen.&quot; Although planned as the first set in a series of sets, &quot;Citizen Z-G&quot; was ultimately the only published set.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "The Big Push covers the gigantic battle of the Somme in summer-fall of 1916. Rivaling Verdun in ferocity, scale and casualties, Somme was Britain's first real chance to open up the Western Front in World War I. French and British allies, wanting to take initiative away from Germany at Verdun, launched a large joint offensive at the Somme, where their fronts met. British generals called it the &quot;Big Push,&quot; to break the trenches and carry them to victory. Here was a campaign that brought little save the cultural annihilation of the participants. Europe never looked at war quite the same way after the Somme.&#10;&#10;The British player controls the Allied forces (British and French), while the other player commands the defending German Army. It is also possible to have three players--French, British, and German. Each Game Turn represents one week. Map scale measures approximately 1142 yards per square (squares rather than hexes are used to prevent the easy outflanking of enemy units - something very hard to do in WW1). Ground units range in size from regiments to divisions. Each infantry strength point varies between 700 and 1500 men, depending on nationality and fighting effectiveness. Support units, like artillery, cavalry and tanks, focus their strength more on relative fire power and attack force. Play begins with artillery fire, where the other player may throw in his counter battery fire to offset the barrages. Ground movement comes next, followed by the declaration of assaults, appeals to command center resources, and defensive fire. After assaults take place, the phasing player introduces replacements and tries to rally his disordered units.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "The trick-taking game Tricky Dungeon is played with 15 different hero cards and a 32 card deck that consists of 8 cards in 4 suits. The hero cards are offered in 3 different languages: English, German and Dutch. The playing cards are language independant and are valued 0 to 7. The cards with value 3 and 4 in each suit are magical spells. Each suit also has one card marked as a potion, the value being different in each suit. These special cards offer special gameplay effects, depending on which hero is chosen in a round. The other playing cards show typical dungeon inhabitants. These become relevant with a few heroes that are in the game.&#10;&#10;Players compete over multiple rounds to accumulate the most gold and the player who ends up with the most gold wins the game. There are 3 sets of 5 unique heroes and each game a set of 5 heroes is chosen to play with. Every round one of the players acts as the active player and has to choose one of 5 available heroes. Each hero changes the game and describes how gold is earned. All the other players have to cooperate and try to stop the active player from reaching this goal.&#10;&#10;The active player chooses the hero to play with after the playing cards are dealt. In a 4 player game each player receives 7 cards. The remaining 4 cards are set aside. After the active player has chosen the hero for the round, that player may exchange up to 4 cards from hand with the remaining cards. In a 2 and 3 player game each player is dealt 9 cards and 5 cards are set aside and available for exchanging.&#10;&#10;Each hero determines the goal for the active player how gold can be earned. This can be a scaling amount of gold. For example if a player chooses the Barbarian gold is earned for every collected trick and potion card above a certain threshold. Some heroes offer a fixed amount of gold. For example, if a player chooses the Assassin, 4 gold is earned if the active player wins the final trick of the round. When the active player did not manage to earn any gold, all other players are rewarded for their good cooperation by earning 1 gold each. Some heroes change the game in other ways, for example playing cards without revealing them or making use of the set aside cards during a round.&#10;&#10;The playing and winning of the tricks uses mostly standard trick-taking rules. The first played card of a trick determines the suit that is asked. Other players must follow suit, if they can. In general the player who played highest card of the suit that is requested, wins the trick. Some heroes add trump cards that round, this can be a suit, one of the special cards (magical spells, potions) or even a specific number. If one or more trump cards is played in a trick, the highest trump wins the trick. Each suit is ranked (1 to 4), if multiple trump cards of the same value are played (e.g. multiple 4's with a hero in play that makes them trump), the higher ranked suit wins the trick.&#10;&#10;The three sets of five heroes each offer a range of options for players. Starting players are recommended to play with set A first. Sets B and C offering more tricky heroes to play with. Besides these three unique set of hero options, the game also suggests a few variants to increase variability. Instead of playing 2 rounds per player the 'Adventurer's Guild' variant forces players to play once with each of the five heroes that game as an active player. Another variant, 'Random Dungeon', shuffles all the 15 heroes together and the active player is offered 1 hero at random to choose to play with. Up to two times this hero can be refused an a new hero is revealed.&#10;&#10;",

Using the investigation speed indicated on the card each player has in hand, players take turns guessing which player (whether yourself or someone else) holds the &quot;Lost Legacy&quot; card; this card might also be in the &quot;Ruins&quot;, a location that holds one card at the start of the game and possibly acquires more cards during play. The player who guesses correctly wins; if no one finds the Lost Legacy, then everybody loses.&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "The eternal turning of the seasons has come full cycle once again. Spring in the hight country enters with a wash of fresh green and the warming chinook, while the show still lies deep on the mountain peaks. As the snow recedes, wild flowers of every hue splash across the lush meadows of the Northern Rockies. The small life in burrow and den creep forth, the birds sing loudly in the pines. Spring is the true beginning of the new year in the awakening wilderness of the Yellowstone.&#10;&#10;The old buck raises his head and turns his gaze to the horizon. The time has come - now to lead the herd to the summer pasture where the bounty of this land will drive away the hunger of winter past. But other animals have come forth from their dens with the spring - the coyote, grizzly bear, mountain lion, and the deadliest predator of all - Man. The natural dangers of this magnificent, rugged land loom ahead. Yet the herd, to prosper, must take to the well-worn trail, seeking to cross the migratory paths of the other grazing masses. As the young gambol and explore, every instinct of the old buck must be devoted to the trek. Without hesitation, he takes the first step toward the future.&#10;&#10;Yellowstone is a less complex game dealing with moving your herd from Winter Pasturage to Summer Pasturage back to Winter Pasturage.  Players control one of the following herds: bison, elk, sheep, or mule deer.  Along the way, you try to pick up Food Points and avoid predators.  You can move the animals in your herd a certain number of hexes in a turn; males are the fastest, females are a bit slower, babies are really slow and should be accompanied by females.  However, when you finally get back to Winter Range, you score more for babies and females than you do for males -- so you may find it necessary to sacrifice a male or two to predators.  Predators are controlled by your opponents, but you get to control them on your turn.  They are not major threats, but inducement to keep moving.  Collect those food points!  You'll need them for winter.&#10;The game's map centers on the Yellowstone Park area and some of the land south of there.&#10;&#10;",

If your Harvey falls all the way to the bottom, then you have to start again from the top.  Beginners play with 4 pegs, while advanced players use 3.&#10;&#10;",

It's up to you to choose the one that will win the day before you make the last lap, with the other biathletes chasing you.&#10;&#10;Goal of the game: Embody a biathlete during an unbearable suspense race.&#10;How to play: Choose their characteristics, rather very good at shooting or very good at skiing, unless you prefer them to be good in both disciplines. Each type of biathlete has its own set of movement die, shooting dice and Energy deck. &#10;You have energy cards that allow you to make the difference in the terrible climbs to leave your competitors behind. But this reserve is not inexhaustible.

    "description": "Opus-Dei: Existence After Religion&trade; is an atheist-themed game built around the world of philosophy, though no philosophical knowledge is needed to play, as it is a purely strategy-based game. The bonus-information, quotes and pictures of the philosophers, scientists and religious figures should however expand most peoples knowledge of philosophy.&#10;&#10;When playing the game, a queue of potentially existing philosophers, scientists and fools are lined up for each round. These humans are worth varying amounts of points, according to their intellectual status and magnitude. It is then up to each Zeitgeist, in their turn, to create the best of them into their particular World by playing up to two cards that can serve their best interests. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins!&#10;&#10;",
