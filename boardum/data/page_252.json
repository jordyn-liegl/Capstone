Each player is given 60 seconds to draw a shape with a loop of string, move it around, and interact with it, trying to help other players guess that word, then as many other words as possible in the time allotted.&#10;&#10;On a player's turn, they draw the top card of the deck, with each card showing four numbered objects or phrases; the top card of the deck will show 1-4 numbers, and those numbers indicate which objects the drawer can choose to depict with the string.&#10;&#10;When the drawer is ready, they flip the sand timer, grab the string, and start &quot;drawing&quot; &mdash; but they can interact with that drawing to help others guess the object, such as strumming a guitar, moving the tentacles on an octopus, or twirling the rotors on a helicopter. The drawer can't make any noise, and part of the string has to remain touching the table while they animate their drawing. Otherwise, the drawer can get crazy with it.&#10;&#10;The other players call out their ideas, and when a player guesses the word correctly, they receive the card, then the drawer quickly moves on to their next drawing. When time is up, the drawer scores 1 point for each word that was guessed correctly, and each player scores 1 point for each correct guess they made.&#10; The game contains three types of challenge words that are harder to draw, but worth 2 points if guessed:&#10;&#10;&#10;    2-Player: Make the drawing in the air with another player.&#10;    Don't Look: Draw with your eyes closed.&#10;    Forbidden Word: Guessing a certain word costs a card.&#10;&#10;&#10;After everyone has had two turns as the drawer (or one turn in a game with seven or more players), the game ends, and the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

Shuffle the treasure tiles, then place them in a face-up stack on the table.&#10;&#10;To start a turn, the player rolls both dice, then moves either Pirate Joe or the monkey one or two spaces clockwise (to a new island) depending on whether the pirate die shows 1-2 sabres or 1-2 bananas. She then moves Coco Capitano a number of spaces equal to the number of pips. If the captain shares a space with one of the other figures, she ends her turn empty-handed; if the captain is alone, she collects the top treasure from the stack and places it in front of her.&#10;&#10;She then has the option of stopping and keeping the treasure, or of rolling the dice again. If the captain lands on an occupied space, she loses all the treasure gained this turn, placing it on the bottom of the treasure stack. She keeps taking turns until she stops or runs out of luck.&#10;&#10;Once all the treasure tiles have been claimed, the game ends and players tally their scores, earning 1 point for a treasure chest, 2 for barrels, and 3 for bags. The player with the most points wins!&#10;&#10;Variants: For younger players, ignore the points and instead see who collected the most tokens. For older players, use only six islands instead of seven.&#10;&#10;",

If you&rsquo;re the first to match your letters, slam on the pot&rsquo;s lid to score.&#10;&#10;Gameplay summary: Each player gets a card of 5 words with a range of difficulty from 1 to 5.  Players announce the word they will try to spell.  The pot is opened and everyone scoops tiles out of the pot at the same time.  The pot contains letter and blank tiles, plus 2 &quot;fly in the soup&quot; tiles.  If a player gets one of these tiles, they must take all tiles they scooped, plus any matched, and put them back in the pot.  The fly in the soup tile is then out of play.  Letter or blank tiles are either matched to the word or put back into the pot.  The players keep scooping and replacing tiles until one player calls out &quot;Yummy!&quot; when they believe they have spelled the word.  If the word is spelled correctly, they win the card, and all of the other cards are discarded and the tiles put back into the pot.  If not, the round continues.

Coming from a distant planet they do not have peaceful intentions: they are ready to assimilate humanity to make us blue, small and flabby just like them. And since the day was not already awful enough, they want to start right from your city. They are plenty, smart and wicked, just like fag ash, but do not panic: as current lodger of planet Earth, we still have some aces in the hole to play.&#10;&#10;On our side, we have unshakable field agents, tough to the bones and loyal to the cause, although limited when it is time to take action. We can also count on a brilliant group of scientists: if these eggheads could just work together, they might indeed find a way to prevent the imminent invasion... too bad that at the first warning they fled and scatter to the ends of the city! They might be braniacs but definitely miss the guts.&#10;&#10;As part of the resistance, your mission is to coordinate the agents on the field and gather all the scientists before the aliens complete their plan of conquering the city. You shall send orders from your secret headquarter, but be aware: the enemy is looking for you, and if it manages to localize you, it would assimilate and bring you by its side with no hesitation! If that happens you will end up in the perfect situation to undermine all the effort of your former comrades.. the Earthlings!&#10;&#10;COURSE OF THE GAME&#10;&#10;The game is divided in three stages that repeat until the end of the game:&#10;1. Event execution (carried out by the architect)&#10;2. Players&lsquo; turns (carried out by all players clockwise)&#10;3. Consolidation (carried out by the architect)&#10;&#10;1. Event execution &#10;The invasion is underway! At any moment an alien attack or a stroke of luck can completely change the situation...&#10;&#10;The architect turns over the top card of&#10;the events deck and execute its effects.&#10;Then, he discards the card.&#10;&#10;2. Players&lsquo; turns&#10;&#10;Each player will be able to command agents in the city or to plan the best strategy to pursue his/her goal. Beware, though: with each action there is the risk of being detected and assimilated by aliens! The alien players may choose to stay hidden until the end of the game or to reveal themselves (without showing their cards)to be in favor with other alien players at the price of exposing themselves to the opposing faction.&#10;&#10;During his/her turn a player may have to perform risky actions that require to draw a given number of assimilation cards. Once drawn, the cards must be kept secret and cannot be revealed to other players. By drawing at least&#10;one Assimilated! card a player becomes an alien.

An alien player drawing a Human card is still alien. Moreover, drawing two or more Assimilated! Cards does not change the situation.&#10;Once alien, alien forever!&#10;&#10;3.

Per turn, the active player divides letters in different piles. Afterwards, each other player chooses a pile, with the remaining pile left over for the active player.

Picture cards are placed between two number cards. If the picture card is a Pac-Man card, the two number cards which bracket it are added together.&#10;&#10;If the card is a Ghost card, the number card on the right is subtracted from the card on the left. So opponents are allowed to place ghost cards and number cards on opponents game boards in an attempt to hinder point scoring.&#10;&#10;There is also a Pac-Man eating a Ghost card which acts as a multiplier between the two numbers.&#10;&#10;Players play one card per turn, and the person who reaches 100 points if the winner.&#10;&#10;An advanced version would subtract points from the players running total if the three card combination included a ghost and the subtraction resulted in a negative total.&#10;&#10;",

A set of food chits, each 1/3 of a circle, are placed in a bag. Players each take a few animal cards (based on the number of players) and on turn draw a food chit blindly from the bag.

This engaging and easy-to-learn game [20 minutes to learn] plays just like Bridge &mdash; but without the complex bidding.&quot; Two decks are included, each with colored cards numbered 2-14. Teams are chosen and 13 cards dealt to each player. Then each player declares Pass or Play, depending on whether they think their team can win at least 10 of the tricks. If a player says Play in Round 1, they are the &quot;dummy.&quot; They lay all their cards down and declare which color will be trump (or no-trump). Each player then declares their hand's pip strength (small dots on some cards) and color count (largest quantity of one color in their hand). Starting on the dummy's left, cards are played. You must follow suit if you can; highest card  of the 4 wins. [Note: if no one calls play in Round 1, players will bid on how many tricks their team can win.] After 13 tricks, one team scores points as indicated on a chart. If the declaring team fails to make their bid, the opposing team scores. Play ends after four rounds.   &#10;&#10;&#10;",

All players then add up their points from the top-left corner of each card, and also each token scores one point. The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

The cards have values from 5 - 50, with the most cards in the middle of the range. In your turn, you challenge an opponent to a duel in one of the suits. You play a card in any suit (not necessarily the one you are challenging in) , then your opponent plays a card in the same suit. Players can alternately withdraw, or keep going. You then play a different suit - in the same manner, adding up your total score. The suit you challenged in counts double. If the defender withdraws, the challenger places a base (i.e. scores a point) on the defender. If the challenger withdraws, he just finishes his turn without scoring. However, the loser forfeits all cards played (redrawing, but perhaps taking poorer cards), and the winner holds his played cards, and takes the loser's cards into a pool which can score points.&#10;&#10;If no one withdraws after all four suits have been played, players may add gray cards in an attempt to take the lead. Ultimately, a player will pass or run out of gray cards, at which point the high score will win the hand.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "This abstract game cleverly exploits its theme of warring spiders to introduce children to thinking games.  The board represents a web with two nests at opposite ends, and stands up between the players.  Each player uses his side of the board to move his spiders on (three small ones and a large one).  Each spider has two long flexible legs with which it steps over the web; each leg ends in a peg which fits into holes in the web.  The catch is that if you insert your peg in a hole occupied by an opponent's spider, it pushes his peg out.  A spider hanging by only one leg is a &quot;dangler&quot; and is in danger of being pushed off the web altogether (and out of the game) should the opponent push its other leg out.  Re-attaching a dangler uses up one's entire turn.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is either to eliminate all of the opponent's spiders or put a leg in his nest.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you move two different legs, belonging to the same or two different spiders.  The small spiders' leg span confines them to adjacent holes.  The big spider, the Daddy Long Leg, has a greater span and can use holes two spaces apart.  A move consist of detaching a leg, pivoting around the other, and plugging the free leg back in.&#10;&#10;",

Each time you walk on, you may drop another lounger, but these go onto their sides. When you decide you've done enough or cannot move on anyway, you stop drawing and turn your loungers upright. But if you draw a tile you can't place so that you walk on, you lose all the loungers on their sides back to your pot. The tile still gets placed, and the game has a clever rule. Whenever a tile is placed, it must go where it touches the most tiles. So if the tile is going next to where you stand, sometimes you have no choice, the game forces its placement. But usually you have a few choices and these are crucial to pushing your luck.&#10;&#10;Finally, when all the tiles are down, the island is scored. The longest beach gets a 10pt marker, the next a 9pt marker and so on (with rules for tie-breaks). Then, the player with the most loungers on that beach collects to points markers (more tie-breaks). Also, any loungers still in your pot are also worth 1 pt each.&#10;&#10;At first, you think you must fight over owning beaches, and try to wrest back control of a beach. But in fact you will only win by occupying several beaches, and often you only need 3 or 4 markers to secure control. Being able to start a beach, get control, then extend it to get most points will win. Players can be unlucky and draw un-walkable tiles a few times, but this means you are not picking the correct places when jumping.&#10;&#10;As the game ends, your options reduce, but you should have done your work already. The result is a nice looking island, with lush jungle and bluewater inlets, dotted with lots of loungers.&#10;&#10;You have nothing to do till your turn, but if you make the right choices, you should have a winning chance. Knowing when to go one more tile matters, and knowing when to stop. Players with lots of loungers left in front of them can still win, but may have wasted their opportunities.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "From the Website&#10;&#10;Cyberpunk: The Collectible Card Game is a game based in the near dark future of the Cyberpunk world. The world of Cyberpunk is a world in which corporations are the elite ruling class, dark soldiers of fortune rule the streets, and everybody has a price. It is a world based very much on authors like William Gibson, Bruce Sterling, Neal Stephenson, and movies such as &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, &quot;Johnny Mnemonic&quot; (which was based on a Gibson story), and &quot;The Matrix.&quot;&#10;&#10;Combining the elements of these popular worlds, Cyberpunk the CCG is a game where the player sits down to play the special agenda of one of the world's ruling groups (or Sponsors.) The player brings Hackers, Gangers, Rockers, Solos, and many other characters into a cohesive team under their command and then sends them on missions (Black Ops). Once the player has scored 100 ops points by completing missions (each mission is worth a different amount of points) the player wins. However -- in this world of intrigue and backstabbing - style is just as important. A player can also win if they manage to gather 100 points of style. The final way that a player can win is through the special agenda of their sponsor; each of the seven sponsors has a different agenda.&#10;&#10;2013 Edition released in December, 2003 as a limited edition; 2020 Edition released February, 2004&#10;&#10;",

What's more, your dreams have told you that the time has come, the stars have aligned so that you can perform the &quot;Ritual of Appeal&quot; and bring the Grand Octopus to surface once again. To perform the ritual, however, you need the right magical components, components to be found in a famous English university for young wizards and witches &mdash; and you're not the only one seeking them.&#10;&#10;In each round, players secretly place their cultist and monster tokens on locations, then reveal those locations at the same time. If only one cultist group occupies a location, that cult gains strength &mdash; but if two or more cults want the same spot, they must negotiate or both lose cult strength. If, on the other hand, a rival monster occupies the location, the cultist is eliminated. Gulp!&#10;&#10;",

Once you're ready, he moves.  If you guessed correctly, the tanks are killed.

You lose a special shot whenever you lose an AT gun.&#10;&#10;You have 6 moves each turn, no more than 3 per tank (unless down to two or fewer tanks).  Tanks can only go sideways or forward but those that reach the opponent's starting row are marked with a flag and can now move backward.&#10;&#10;Tanks attack each other by orthogonal proximity, in Stratego fashion (higher numbered tank wins).  Tanks attack AT guns using a spinner.  The installations are destroyed by being overrun.
