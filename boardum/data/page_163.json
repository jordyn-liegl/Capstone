He has very particular instructions about what should be painted in specific places. Players will take on the role of painters attempting to paint the new fresco according to his instruction, receiving points in the game for painting the Fresco and bonus points for fulfilling the Bishops' requests.&#10;&#10;During the game players draw color cards which they will use to paint sections of the fresco. Color cards can be gained from the market, which holds the three basic colors, or from the workshop, which contains the mixed color palette. When players have enough colors they can paint a section of the fresco and gain points. Play the right combination of cards, and you will extra points.&#10;&#10;When all sections of the fresco are painted, players total up their points and who has the most points is the winner of the game.&#10;&#10;Fresco - The Dice Game&#10;&#10;Roll and combine the right combination of dice to gain fresco tiles and be the first to complete your fresco!&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to complete the five different tiles to form a complete fresco. In order to complete a fresco tile players have to roll a result that matches the number next to each fresco tile.&#10;&#10;On their turn, players roll the dice exactly three times, on each roll setting one die aside. After the three rolls, the pips on the three set aside dice are added together, which allows the player to collect the corresponding tile. If the result does not match a fresco tile number, they gain a portrait token which will grant bonuses or points. The two color dice can be used to double the number on the corresponding colored die, making it easier to reach the higher numbers.&#10;&#10;Before a turn players can place the bishop on one of the five fresco tile spaces, earning extra points if they manage to roll that exact number. Other players can bet on whether the player is successful or not, and will earn some extra points if they guess correctly. At the end of the game, players count the points on their fresco and portrait tiles, and whomever has the most points is the winner of the game.&#10;&#10;",

The Southwest Front of the Red Army of Workers and Peasants struck back, resulting in World War II&rsquo;s largest tank battle.&#10;&#10;Fire in the Steppe is a complete Panzer Grenadier game based on the early battles of Operation Barbarossa in Ukraine: the huge tank battles around Brody and Dubno.  There are 42 scenarios based on these battles, organized into &ldquo;battle games&rdquo; that allow you to play the scenarios in sequence toward your army&rsquo;s operational goals. Plus a solitaire campaign game!&#10;&#10;Fire in the Steppe includes 562 playing pieces, most of which originally appeared in our old out-of-print Eastern Front game.  There are eight heavy cardstock maps: new versions of those which appeared in Eastern Front, with completely new artwork by Guy Riessen so they match up nicely with those from games like Broken Axis and Burning Tigers.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "In the all-too-distant future, a bunch of people play a dangerous sport called Fightball, and James Ernest wrote a game about it.&#10;&#10;The setting is the streets of the future &mdash; not the real future, but the crazy apocalyptic future we all know and love. In this particular future, gangs of street thugs have (again) become enamored of the world of modern professional sports. Unfortunately, they have no real idea of how these modern sports were played, besides what they can guess from old photographs and what they know about the sports of their day. If all future sports use multiple balls, surely so did the sports of the twentieth century, right? And even if they didn't, they should have.&#10;&#10;Thus was born Fightball, a weird version of basketball with at least three balls &mdash; maybe more, we're not sure &mdash; two goals, and extremely violent gameplay. The sport is played on the streets and overseen by flying robot referees, and it's played by the weirdest assortment of folks you're likely to see in a game.&#10;&#10;Basically, Fightball is like basketball. Players build a &quot;court&quot; out of 24 cards and play four rounds. The play is fast and furious, with each player playing as fast as he can. When one player reaches the &quot;BUZZ&quot; card (at the bottom of the deck) the round is over. Now, players score each location on the court, looking for a sequence of cards starting with a player, then a ball, then a shot. Other cards, like blockers, can affect the quality of the shot. Some shots succeed, and are worth points. Others fail, and are worth nothing. The highest score at the end of four rounds wins the game!&#10;&#10;Fightball was released as three sets of double decks, and any two decks can be played against one another.&#10;&#10;",

Until recently, your people have been living peacefully in underground dwellings to protect themselves from the noxious gases on the surface. But now you are besieged by violent and increasingly frequent asteroid attacks, which are causing irreparable damage and threatening your very existence.&#10;&#10;Working together with the other rulers, you must rally the troops to build infrastructure and develop technologies that will protect you from the asteroids and will ultimately allow you to escape. Use your race&rsquo;s special powers to help you and your neighbouring moons, which are suffering the same fate, to settle on Uranus before your moons explode.&#10;&#10;This is a co-operative game: players work together to try to beat the game. Players win the game if they manage to get all of the moon races housed in completed modules on Uranus before the moons explode. No race must be left behind.&#10;&#10;Each round has four phases that must be completed in order. Players play simultaneously within each phase, but wait until all players have finished a phase before moving on together to the next.&#10;&#10;Phase 1: Asteroid track. If the asteroid track marker lands on an asteroid attack, the next attack is carried out. Areas of moons are damaged and 'go dark' making these sections unusable.&#10;&#10;Phase 2: Mine and transport. Each mine on a player's moon produces a moon rock of the appropriate colour. The rocks are then transported along tunnel and grouped together in connected networks.&#10;&#10;Phase 3: Use and remove. Groups of moon rocks are used together towards a single project. Progress is marked on the project board. Players may get ready to build tunnels and mines, construct launchpads and fortifications, load up their space gun or work towards developing different technologies. Each technology helps the players to progress in the game.&#10;&#10;Phase 4: Build and activate. Completed projects can now be constructed on your moon. Mines may be built or fortified. Tunnels constructed or removed. Networks will change as your need for different groupings of resources changes.&#10;&#10;When all players have discovered spaceship technology and habitation modules are constructed on Uranus, players may travel to Uranus.

Animals, of course, with the game including six types of animals on 1x1 tiles as well as a dozen animals on 1x2 and 2x1 tiles.&#10;&#10;In each of the three rounds, you're going to use a worker-placement style system to acquire animals tiles, guest cubes, special action cards, door tokens, and more. Guests come in six colors: five of which match five of the animal colors (and these guests only want to see those types of animals), and a sixth color (white) that doesn't care what type of animal they see. Those are the guests you want most, but of course to acquire them, you must give up other things.&#10;&#10;Many of the animal tiles have walls along one or more edge, and these tiles should be placed against other tiles with walls. During the round, you'll place the animal tiles that you've acquired on the board, with these tiles touching one of the four entrances around the perimeter of your zoo, and before the round ends, you'll &quot;lead&quot; the guests through your zoo, with the red cube stopping at the red (carnivorous) animal, the blue cube stopping at the blue animal, and so on.&#10;&#10;You might need to snake your way around doors that block direct access to an animal, or you might have a door token that lets you cut through. When you don't have a matching guest for the next animal (or vice versa), the tour that day is done.&#10;&#10;After three rounds, the game ends, with players possibly scoring extra points based on their final bonus card, such as the number of rows and columns in your zoo that are filled or the number of rows that have four or five different types of animals.&#10;&#10;Solitaire rules are included with 5x5 Zoo.&#10;&#10;",

Vehicle and artillery rules are included for a combined arms gaming experience with statistics provided for all manufacturers of 15mm sci-fi and modern figures.&#10;&#10;The rules and statistics in Gruntz cover modern and futuristic technology, allowing for low tech and high tech mixed battles. The system includes statistics for alien technology and weird war style creatures like zombies and werewolves, so most modern and futuristic settings can be played.&#10;&#10;Gruntz only uses D6 die for all rolling and the core mechanic is based around a 2D6 roll adding a number from the models statistics and to succeed at a task you must beat a certain target number. For example if you wanted a unit of Gruntz to shoot at another unit, you add the Shoot statistic of the Gruntz firing to your 2D6 roll and must equal or exceed the ToHit statistic of the target model. For most actions you modify the roll depending on certain conditions.&#10;&#10;Initiative is based on a standard turn sequence or playing card base initiative which adds a series of special conditions for any Ace cards drawn and assigned to units.&#10;&#10;",

There are only three types of roles, and the feature is that anyone can play easily.&#10;&#10;When it's your turn, just draw one tile from the field and discard one. Although it is a simple action, you can change the hand you are aiming for by switching the tiles in your hand up and down, and you will notice that there are many options.&#10;&#10;The game ends when someone completes a role, and they take scoring chips according to their role.

In turn order, the active player has to play a card (if possible) and pass the turn until all the cards of the game are played. There are two ways to play cards:&#10;&#10;1) FACE DOWN: Place a tunnel card in the center of the table to complete the word &quot;SCAPE&quot;. If another card with same letter has already been played this way, you have to play it on top.&#10;&#10;2) FACE UP: Play the action indicated on the card, then discard it, showing the letter and identity of the card.&#10; Finish your turn by drawing until you have four cards (if able), then the player on your right becomes active.&#10;&#10;When all the cards have been played, the first card of each tunnel pile is revealed. If the SCAPE word is not complete, the &ldquo;SS&rdquo; player wins the game. If there is any card with the &quot;SS&quot; identity revealed in any heap, the &quot;SS&quot; player wins; otherwise, the team (RAF/USAF) with most heaps with its affiliation wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Avalon is a card-based game where a line of 11 landscape cards form the board and the cards in your hand are made up of Knights and Enchantresses. There are 8 of each in each of five different colors, for a total of 80 cards, which both players share as a common draw deck.&#10;&#10;The game starts with the landscapes face down, randomly assigned knights or enchantresses on each player's side of the landscape cards, and five knights/enchantresses in each players hand. In the course of the game, if you play knights on your side of the territory and you have at least as many cards on your side before playing the card, you have the option of declaring an attack with that knight. The other player has a chance to respond by defending with a knight of exactly the same color (in which case both knights are left in place). If the attacker is successful, the loser loses all of their cards from their side, and the winner loses an equal number. Then, the winner must lose an additional number of cards from their side or the hand equal to the total number of knights on both sides that were involved in the conflict. Finally, the region is turned face up with the crowns on the bottom facing toward the controlling player. You can only attack up to two landscapes per turn, but you may play as many cards as you would like to on your turn. The max hand size at the end of a round is 5. The object is to control 15 crowns at the end of your turn (number of crowns on a card ranges from 1-3).&#10;&#10;Two landscape cards have special abilities - Avalon reduces your loss from battles by one once per turn, and the forest with a standing stone allows you to declare an attack on your opponent with an enchantress as if she was a knight.&#10;&#10;Enchantresses normally will convert enemy knights from their side of the board to yours unless countered with a same color enchantress. The countering player receives the aggressor's attacking enchantress into his hand if he counters an enchantress.&#10;&#10;When the player is done playing cards, he draws one of the 5 Light tiles or 4 Dark tiles that describe the options for replenishing cards in hand. Light tiles give you their benefit immediately, and Dark tiles give you their benefit at the beginning of your next turn. Each tile is used only once until all tiles have been used, at which point they are all available again. After drawing a replenishment tile, the player's turn is over and the game continues with the next player.&#10;&#10;Avalon is part of the Kosmos two-player series.&#10;&#10;",

In turn, players place a card on the table, trying to place their card in chronological order to those already present. Instead of adding a card, a player may claim that the order in which the cards have been placed is incorrect. In this case all cards are turned over and the correct years revealed.&#10;&#10;If the order is correct, then the doubting player receives two cards and skips a turn.

You are a fossil-hunting paleontologist with the goal of constructing complete dinosaur skeletons that attract visitors to your museum.  Each dinosaur skeleton has a different point value (represented as visitors per year) and may consist of two, three, or four unique fossils.&#10;&#10;On each turn, you dig fossils from the dig site (scattered face-down fossil cards), initiate trades with other players, take a bonus dig if you manage to complete a skeleton for your museum, and rearrange your fossil cards so that all but three are visible to other players.  Strategic choices include deciding which fossils to expose and the number of increasingly expensive trades you perform to try to complete a skeleton or win a research award.  Random events, such as erosion, may force you to alter your strategy.&#10;&#10;Fossil Canyon uses a unique jigsaw-puzzle scoring method, where each skeleton or research award is represented by a puzzle piece with a length proportional to its value.  No adding victory points or moving pawns on a board; the length of your puzzle-museum indicates your standing in the game.&#10;&#10;Fossil Canyon is a family-oriented STEM game.  Adults will appreciate the beautifully-illustrated cards and the unique set-collection mechanics that make Fossil Canyon a fast-playing, lightly-strategic game.  Children will love the dinosaur theme and the tactile jigsaw puzzle scoring, turning the game into a race.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

O'Brien scheduled a world-wide pub crawl and invited all the greatest fighters in the land to take part. Can you become the greatest fist-fighter in the World of Indines by fighting your way through seven rounds, punching and gouging your way to supremacy?&#10;&#10;At the start of 7-Card Slugfest, each player chooses one of eleven characters and takes a set of seven cards associated with that character. In each set, four cards are simple punches &ndash; doing a variable amount of damage &ndash; while three also have special effects. At the beginning of each round of the game, players shuffle their deck and place it face down in front of them. A stage card is flipped over to show the rewards for first, second and third most KO points earned this round.&#10;&#10;When someone yells fight, the players simultaneously start picking up cards from their decks, looking at them, then playing them on another character. Whenever a player runs out of cards, they take a drink token from a common supply. Their character's stamina is ten, plus or minus the value of that drink token. When everyone has played his cards, the next step is to resolve the stacks of cards played on characters, applying damage in the order it was dealt. If a character's stamina is equalled or exceeded, the character who achieved the knockout earns a KO point. If a character survives all the punches aimed at him, then he receives the KO point. Players can also score two KO points for knocking out Boris, a non-player character. KO points are turned into gold according to each round's stage card, and the player with the most gold at the end of seven rounds wins.&#10;&#10;",

Set in a fictive fantasy setting, champions from all over the known world meet to compete for the title of champion of Duelists.&#10;&#10;Every character comes with their own deck of cards featuring different attacks, defenses and abilities.&#10;&#10;Players take turns planning and attacking. There's always three cards played out in front of each player, with only the least recent card being active. When performing an attack, the attacking player sets a damage die to a number they want to use, while the opponent gets to guess the damage set based on the cards both played.&#10;&#10;Damage is done directly from the card decks of each player, thereby limiting their options the more damage they take. Once a player can no longer fill their hand when it's their time to do so, they have lost the battle and surrender.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Each battle was not only a clash of arms but also a clash of military systems and weapons. The English longbow would be pitted against the French lance, with the crown of France in the balance.&#10;&#10;THE BLACK PRINCE game system, designed by Rob Markham, is medium complexity and features rules on the longbow, heavy cavalry charges, commands and command control, ammunition, and demoralization. The system is quick to learn and quick to play, with games taking between 1/2 and 3 hours to play.&#10;&#10;",

Second (or first), buy the right to place it in a row or column labeled with a particular letter.  There's an auction on each player's turn where one choice in both these possibilities goes on sale at the same time.  So, perhaps the auction is for B, or a blue pearl.  If you win the auction and you've already got a pearl, you immediately have to choose a spot for it somewhere in row or column B; if you've already got your letter bought, you get the blue pearl and immediately choose a spot for it; if you've got neither, you can take either one and await getting the other in a later auction.&#10;&#10;Ultimately your scores are determined by how many pearls of the same color are clustered together and the number of empty spaces surrounding the cluster, and whether you have more pearls than anyone else in the cluster.&#10;&#10;Tahiti is an excellent choice if you enjoy auctions, area majorities, and that &quot;Acquire&quot; kind of feeling you get from watching squares fill in and grow into scoring groups.&#10;&#10;",

Furthermore, players can build Strongholds, battle enemies or receive bounty from specific hexagons on the board.

However if you take too long or choose the wrong path around the map, you give your opponents the chance to become empowered and so the balance of the game can quickly shift the other way.&#10;&#10;The first player who combines four elements to create the Mythalix, claims the victory!&#10;&#10;",

Homecoming was also marred by the tragic death of Becky Sue Lamour, a student at Roley High who was killed near midnight after the Homecoming dance, when the car in which she was a passenger stalled on the railroad tracks at Back Road Crossing and was struck by a freight train.

When completely addressed, the game is a War College-level education on the conduct of World War III operations at Division/Brigade level between NATO and Soviet forces. The game system builds on the combat-as-part-of-movement late-SPI systems such as Next War and Fifth Corps, and has as one of its basic premises the idea that unit strength is subordinate to tactical and command considerations.&#10;&#10;Central to its uniqueness, NATO Division Commander contains two identical mapboards and rules for Controller play, producing a refereed, double-blind, fog-of-war effect which is still unique today, more than 30 years after publication.  The game includes solitaire and face-to-face rules to help controllers build up their knowledge of the game, and decide what they will include, and what slows the game down too much for their taste: thus allowing the game experience to be controlled for the players' experience and expectations. It also allows testing of scenarios before controller use.&#10;&#10;Scenarios are comprehensive and infinitely flexible, which makes demands of controllers, and offer a unique playing experience for those peering down the gun barrel.&#10;&#10;With 1200 counters, rule books, and a pile of playing aids, NATO Division Commander still is, the one true smorgasbord of World War III land-based operational simulations.&#10;&#10;",

Now is your opportunity to face off Poseidon against Ishtar! Thor against Cthulhu! Morrigan against Yog-Sothoth! You have one goal and one goal only: annihilate your foes' believers and seize absolute power.&#10;&#10;Achieve this task by staking the souls of your followers, using the same bluff, psychology, and tactics that have made Texas Hold 'em Poker the world's premier card game. Once you seize victory, you can rest, and listen to the cheerful song of your people. You have won the clash of the gods. You have won Theomachy.&#10;&#10;The game is quick to play &ndash; typically less than 45 minutes. First, choose your god. Then, drafting cards into your personal deck lets you slowly build your might. Ante up your followers, and stake them against your foes' minions. You can call, raise, or fold, in similar fashion to high-stakes Poker games (and what stake is higher than your own worshipers' souls?)&#10;&#10;Your spells are powered by a Constellation, which is laid down in the middle of the table as a Texas Hold'em Poker style flop, river, and turn. Just as in Hold 'em, some Constellation configurations provide you with great combinations for your secret hand of cards, some are disastrous, while most are middling to fair.&#10;&#10;Using miracles, spells, and powerful artifacts, powered by the Constellation, send your followers into battles, build temples, and inflict terrible curses on the unfaithful. You face a tough decision in every hand: do you put your power on the line to help your believers, or do you turn your back to cut your losses, abandoning them to certain death? If neither you nor your opponents yield, the showdown takes place - hurricanes are opposed by deathly plagues, tempests extinguish walls of fire, and the ranks of the faithful shrink every second.&#10;&#10;Use your god&rsquo;s power to create miracles and activate myth cards for your heroes, temples, and godly artifacts. For example, the Norse pantheon has access to the Fenris wolf, Thor's hammer, and more. Babylon has Lilith, Ur, the tower of Babel, and more. Even the Lovecraft pantheons have myth cards and their own dark miracles. Place Wilbur Whateley in the forefront of your fight, or wield the Pallid Mask!&#10;&#10;Theomachy: The Warrior Gods includes four pantheons: Celtic, Norse, Slavonic, and Lovecraft's Great Old Ones.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "The greatest nation in the world is in decline. A wealthy oligarchy has all the money, land, and power, leaving the masses to starve and struggle under the weight of oppressive debts. A bitter, partisan feud between polar opposites &ndash; liberal and conservative &ndash; finds no room for compromise. Government, once conducted with dignity and restraint, becomes a dangerous game of brinksmanship and obstructionism. The very foundations of the republic are undermined by demagogues and dictators, using civil unrest to seize power. Opponents are marginalized or made to disappear, with even murder given the veneer of legitimacy retroactively. The result is the collapse of the old order, and the establishment of new, totalitarian regime, with the populace often at the mercy of madmen and idiots, the venal and the vainglorious.&#10;&#10;We are talking, of course, about the Roman Republic. OPTIMATES ET POPULARES is a political game for two players, in which players fight for the primacy and dominance of their ideology. The Populares (&quot;populists&quot;) pursue a liberal and egalitarian agenda that seeks to better the lives of the poor through measures such as land redistribution, debt relief, and welfare programs. The Optimates (or &quot;best men&quot;) aim to thwart this progress, maintaining the traditional rights and privileges of the wealthy elites. Both players seek to win elections and pass laws, and to prevent their opponents from doing the same, using every tool at their disposal - building alliances through influential Senators, buying loyalties, inciting mob violence, and proscription - state-sanctioned murder.&#10;&#10;Central to the game is Political Will. Each action you take will cost you some Political Will. The more you accomplish, the more anger it incites in the opposition and its supporters - and so, each action you take also cedes Political Will to your opponent. This creates a dynamic tension in which each player must balance pursuit of his own goals against the backlash that's just around the corner. Each law you pass will also have subtle (and not-so-subtle) effects on the People of Rome and the Senate, building or eroding support for your overall platform. It's a careful balancing act - a vicious teeter-totter - a knife-fight on a tightrope.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Dreadball: KickOff packs all the hyper-kinetic sci-fi sports game speed and ferocity of its parent game Dreadball: the Futuristic Sports Game into an introductory version.&#10;&#10;The game lasts 14 turns, with each player getting seven turns. Each turn you have five actions to distribute between your on-field figures. The game takes place on field overlaid with a hex grid.  The aim is to throw the ball for a score into one of three score zones in your opponent's half. After scoring, your turn ends and the ball is launched back onto the field. At the core of the game are the actions. Each of your figures can have up to two of your five allowance spent on him. Players need to plan ahead, especially if they score, since the board does not reset afterwards. Available actions include move, slam (tackle), steal the ball, throw the ball, pick up the ball, and stand up. The actions all have the same basic mechanisms, so learning and remembering them is easy. Seven points or more, or, failing that, the highest score at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;KickOff is a simple new format that features a pocket-sized rulebook, game board, 2 basic starter teams and all the counters and dice needed to play.  It simplifies Dreadball by removing most valuable players, RefBot, fouls and league play. In the box you will find no cards, ref, roster pad or hex bases.  There are also two fewer models per team.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Veracruz: U.S. Invasion of Mexico, was originally published in Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #63. Veracruz is an operational simulation of General Winfield Scott's Mexican campaign, which took place between March and September 1847. The invasion was an American effort to end the Mexican War by marching into the heart of Central Mexico to capture the capital, Mexico City. Diplomatically, it ended the decades of border disputes and opened up vast new territories, which in turn led to the Gold Rush of '49 and the Great Compromise of 1850.&#10;&#10;European commanders and military experts, when viewing the upcoming conflict in 1846, could not see anything but a complete Mexican victory, given the size of her army with it's European system of training and assembly. But the European System was a hollow shell that worked with even less validity in the rigid hierarchical Mexican social structure. The entire system was exacerbated by a succession of generals and other leaders who were inept on a scale that dwarfs even the darkest Union days of the Civil War. On the other hand, many of the best generals of the American Civil War distinguished themselves here as lieutenants and captains: Robert E. Lee (engineers, Scott's chief scout), Ulysses S. Grant, George Pickett, Thomas J. Jackson, Braxton Bragg, Jubal Early, George G. Meade, Phillip Kearney, David D. Porter (USN), and Jefferson Davis, to name a few.&#10;&#10;The map depicts central Mexico down to Mexico City, the target of the American player. Players have to deal with supply and a complex set of morale rules. Counters represent basic units, horses, naval units, leaders and a US dummy unit. Other counters indicate supply, unit effectiveness, fortifications, cities and various status counters.&#10;&#10;Special rules for Yellow Fever ( 2000 U.S. soldiers died in combat conditions but over 11,000 died of disease), Limited Intelligence, Morale, Mexican Political Climate, Navy Gunboats, and Mexican Guerrillas.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 1 week&#10;Hex: 5 miles&#10;Units: Company to Regiments&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 21 x 33&quot; map&#10;One countersheet (200 1/2&quot; dual-side printed counters)&#10;One 26-page Rules booklet&#10;&#10;",

Players assume the role of security employees that spend their office hours hacking into their employer's own mainframe. The goal of the game is  to blackmail your boss into giving you a promotion, which is achieved by collecting a stash of state secrets and juicy office gossip. The first players to have 14 Secrets wins the game.&#10;&#10;Every turn, players have the choice to spend one of their Secrets to start a new hack (rerolling the dice pool), or simply scavenge for remains from the previous hack. They then choose an action from the die pool, removing it from the pool in the process. Players constantly have to weigh up their needs: which option to take yourself vs. which option not to leave for others, and creating new options for yourself vs. not creating new options for others.&#10;&#10;This game was originally created for Randall's Dice Or No Dice contest, which ran in January 2014 on BoardGameGeek.&#10;&#10;",

In each round, each player will be the seller once. The player chooses one of his transaction cards, then places an offer onto the table that at least matches the minimum offer required.

After seeing all of the offers, the seller either trades goods with an opponent or pays 2-4 nuggets to the bank in order to drop his offer into the bank bag (along with his nuggets), then draw that many items from the bag. (The bank bag starts with the same items as each player.)&#10;&#10;In games with at least four players, the seller can pay 2-4 gold nuggets to the bank in order to look at the secret valuation card held by any opponent.&#10;&#10;Once each player has been seller three times, the game ends and everyone reveals their valuation cards. Players then tally their scores, and the player with the highest total wins, with gold nuggets in hand breaking ties.&#10;&#10;",

The battle occurred near the town of Austerlitz in the Austrian Empire (modern-day Slavkov u Brna in the Czech Republic). Austerlitz brought the War of the Third Coalition to a rapid end, with the Treaty of Pressburg signed by the Austrians later in the month.[6] The battle is often cited as a tactical masterpiece&#10;&#10;The game is relatively small, with an 11&quot; x 17&quot; map and 100 counters. The map scale is 600 yards per hex, and each of the eleven game-turns represents one hour. There are four unit types in Battle of Austerlitz: infantry, artillery, cavalry, and dragoon. The infantry units are mostly divisions.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 1 hour&#10;Hex: 600 yards / 550 meters&#10;Units: Battery to Corps (1 strength point equals approximately 500 men or 5 artillery pieces.&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 11 x 17&quot; four color map&#10;One dual-side printed countersheet (100 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 8-page rulebook&#10;One six-sided die&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: High&#10;Complexity Level: Medium&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 2-4 hours&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "From the publisher:&#10;&#10;Red Poppies Campaigns: Volume 2 - Last Laurels at Limanowa (LLL), simulates Austria-Hungary's last independent victory against the Russian Empire in World War I.  In November 1914, Russia's 3rd Army pressed on Krakow, the center of Austrian Poland, while the Russian 8th Army threatened to break through the Carpathian passes into Hungary.  Desperate to relieve the pressure, Franz Conrad von H&ouml;tzendorf, Chief of the General Staff for Austria-Hungary, gambled on a counter attack about 25 miles southwest of Krakow.&#10;&#10;Conrad launched his 4th Army into the thinly held, 20-mile wide gap between the Russian 3rd and 8th Armies on December 3.  Austro-Hungarian forces rolled forward about 12 miles in just three days along a front from Lipanow in the north to Limanowa in the south.  Russian resistance stiffened on the 6th with fierce fighting erupting around the village of Limanowa.  Several days of see-saw action ensued until the lines crystallized on December 11.&#10;&#10;For once, Conrad's daring paid off.  In response to his gains, the Russians scrambled to secure their front and so abandoned plans to drive on Krakow and Hungary.  Conrad, however, paid a heavy price by suffering 12,000 casualties and expending the last of his elite 14th &quot;Innsbruck&quot; infantry corps to stop the Russians who easily absorbed and replaced their 30,000 losses.  Never again would the Austro-Hungarian Army win an independent victory; from now on, all progress depended on German participation.&#10;&#10;LLL is the second volume in the Red Poppies Campaign (RPC) system for gaming World War I battles.  Ownership of volume one, The Battles for Ypres, is NOT required to play LLL; everything you need to play LLL is in this box.  LLL offers the same rules as The Battles for Ypres except that section 12, the Ypres scenarios and campaigns, is intentionally left blank while section 13, the Limanowa scenarios and campaigns, has been added.&#10;&#10;LLL offers a map of the Limanowa battlefield scaled at 200 meters per hex.  Game play proceeds in interactive turns representing 10 minutes of real time each as players maneuver opposing cavalry and infantry companies across a rugged rural landscape typical of the Carpathian foothills.&#10;&#10;Product Information&#10;&#10;&bull; Complexity:                 6 out of 10&#10;&#10;&bull; Solitaire suitability:      8 out of 10&#10;&#10;&bull; Time Scale:                 10 minutes per turn&#10;&#10;&bull; Map Scale:                  200 yards per hex&#10;&#10;&bull; Unit Scale:                 Companies, squadrons, sections&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Will you help these villagers to fend off bandits, or will you command the thieves to steal all the rice you can and punish the insolent peasants?&#10;&#10;Seven Swords is a game for two players in which one player controls seven samurai and the villagers to try to repel the attack of the evil villains while the other player controls the bandits who try to steal all the rice they can and destroy the village. The game lasts 18 turns, after which the player with the most victory points (VPs) wins. The samurai player begins the game with the VPs in the villagers' houses and rice stores, and the bandit player must attack peasant houses and steal rice to acquire these VPs. The bandit player can also earn extra points if he eliminates the samurai in combat.&#10;&#10;Each turns consists of two phases. The bandit, who plays first, has seven cards in hand that symbolize the seven sectors of the village. He discards a card to give himself a number of actions that turn, and he might receive additional actions from the samurai player. With these actions, the bandit can play different bandit troops &ndash; including infantry, archers and cavalry &ndash; with which he can then move around the village and attack the samurai, villagers and rice storage. The samurai player then chooses between five chips &ndash; combat, movement, leadership and two special action chips &ndash; to see how many actions that he has that turn. A samurai can perform three types of actions &ndash; attack, move, and use the villagers to attack bandits &ndash; but only one time for each samurai until one of the special chips has removed the counters of such action. The more actions that the samurai player performs, the more actions the bandit has.&#10;&#10;After a certain number of turns, the bandit player discards one of his action cards, then eliminates any samurai who is in the field of the discarded card. Other details in the game include bows that help players attack from a distance and fences that keep the bandits from just walking into the village. In addition to having a double-sided game board with different village layouts, the samurai player establishes the placement of villagers, fences, nows and rice storage at the start of each game, allowing for wide variability in gameplay.&#10;&#10;",

It takes place in the Dungeonfell, also known as the buried plane, with all but one player acting as a group of adventurers on a quest. The quest is created by the last player, known as the storyteller, who must create a set of challenges based off of quest cards randomly drawn at the start of the game.&#10;&#10;The game concept can be described as putting the spirit of a traditional pen and paper RPG into a micro table top game. Players pick a character background card (ex:  Ogre Slayer, Swindler King, etc.) and add special power cards to them (ex: Fireball, Backstab, etc.) they then draw a Flaw card which gives them a unique attribute (ex: chronic liar, Impatient, etc.) and a personal goal card (in secret) which they must complete in addition to the main quest to win the game (ex:  Outsmart an enemy, Betray a party member, etc.).&#10;&#10;During combat the game is played on modular map cards with heroes and monsters acting in sequence; the storyteller controls all the monsters. Heroes obtain loot cards at the end of combat in addition to leveling their characters stats. To win the game, each player must complete the main quest developed by the storyteller (through the use of the quest cards) as well as their own personal quest cards (which are kept hidden until completed).&#10;&#10;",
