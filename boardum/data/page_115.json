    "description": "The Curse of the Black Dice is a pirate-themed dice game driven by a random mission generator and four possible mission types. The missions are generated by rolling a handful of black dice to determine the difficulty of each part of the mission. By rolling their own player dice and with the help from the pirate crew, the players try to get at least the same amount of dice to each mission part to fulfill this part. Each part grants rewards and penalties, and each mission has another endgame trigger condition: Each mission gives a reward if the crew fulfills it and punishment if they don't. What's more, if pirates don't fulfill the mission, they also risk that the next part of mission will be more difficult because of the curse of the black dice. In the end, only the player who has captured the most amount of gold wins &mdash; that is, if the ship doesn't sink and take all players to the bottom of the ocean with it.&#10;&#10;Sail together to find treasures, board ships, plunder villages, or even kill the mighty Kraken...and betray the other players when they don't expect it. There can be only one winner, but all players can lose together!&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Bank Heist  is a social deduction game for 5 - 8 players with an explosive action phase. The game sets itself apart from other popular social deduction games by not allowing player eliminations until a secondary phase of the game.&#10;&#10;Players are randomly dealt a secret identity card that could read Agent, Rival, or Crew. Agents get to know if they have a comrade as do Rivals. Crew usually have the numbers advantage but are always in the dark.&#10;&#10;The game is played in 2 primary phases: The Robbery and the Getaway. During the Robbery players try to load cash into the truck before the police arrive at the bank. Players draw and pass cards to observe what the receiving players do with those cards in order to figure out who they can trust. Crew must place cash bags into the truck. There is one Crew member that has &quot;Sticky Fingers&quot; and must keep cash bags even though they win or lose with the Crew. Agents try to stop the Robbery by keeping cash bags. Rivals need a successful robbery, but will try to eliminate the others before the end of the game. Not all cards are cash. The deck is filled with items such as Adrenaline, Zip Ties, Knives, and more.&#10;&#10;As the Robbery moves along, players also flip over Alarm cards which cause instant actions to happen such as checking other players Identity card for a Crew Tattoo or showing your hand to a player you trust. Additionally, there are Attribute cards such as Martial Skills or Gun Jammed which can enhance or hinder player abilities.&#10;&#10;If the Robbery is successful, play moves to the Getaway. During this phase players will use the information and items they collected during the Robbery to eliminate those they don't trust before the truck reaches the Hideout. Each faction has different abilities during this phase that will help them achieve their specific win conditions.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

It is 1025, and the emperor Basileios II has ascended into the heavens without providing for an heir. In Constantinople, representatives from the most important aristocratic families vie for their favored to inherit the Emperor's ring and throne.&#10;&#10;It is a futile and petty dispute as each family is not about to surrender the throne to any of the others, but they ultimately decide that the winner will be the one who's supported by most of the wealthiest cities of the empire. Every ambitious successor raises the banner of  his dynasty and begins the struggle to win over the cities that will secure him the throne.&#10;&#10;Each family secretly chooses seven imperial cities that they will seek to control through the actions available to them: Commandment, Diplomacy, Exile, Trade, Garrison, Espionage, and Corruption. May the rightful heir arise!&#10;&#10;&#10;Nekken is a fantasy-themed implementation of this game using the exact same materials as Byzantio and with a map on the reverse side of the game board, giving a different game experience and essentially two games in one.&#10;&#10;Four tribes have been living in peace for over 3000 years despite the ancient hatred of each other. United in the capital city Nekken, they slowly forgot their fear of the large volcano that looms over the metropolis &ndash; until the volcano erupted. Forced to abandon their homes, the tribes spread throughout the continent, facing danger in many forms while trying to establish new colonies. Their ancient hatred has also been awakened and now they must struggle to survive. However, they still need each other, a new cold war emerges in the shadow of the searing heat of the volcano.&#10;&#10;In Nekken, each player takes the role of a leader of their tribe and tries to be the one who will prevail and become the ruler of this new society. The goal is to achieve prestige through the establishment of new and glorious cities, using actions to move their leader on the map, exploring, establishing cities, betraying friends to achieve their objective. Hopefully no other ruler intends on settling in the same place!&#10;&#10;",

A player can choose to change the number on a die up or down by one instead of moving.&#10;&#10;The game revolves around attempting to land on other ships (friendly or otherwise) which allows sliding down at least one loop of spiral until it reaches an unoccupied spot, thus cutting out a lot of transit time.  When this happens, the die is rolled before it is placed in its landing spot to receive a new number. Typically, long chains are formed which can be taken advantage of by all players. Knowing when to form, break, take advantage of, and foil the use of these chains is the key to winning.&#10;&#10;In the three-player version, the first player to get 4 of their 6 ships out wins.

    "description": "The 1920s &mdash; a time that is often referred to as the &quot;Roaring Twenties&quot;, a boisterous period characterized by rapidly changing lifestyles, financial excesses, and the fast pace of technological progress. In 1919, the requisite number of legislatures of the States ratified the 18th Amendment to the Federal Constitution, enabling national Prohibition within one year of ratification. Prohibition began on January 16, 1920 when the Eighteenth Amendment went into effect. During this time, the sale, manufacture, and transportation (a.k.a. bootlegging) of alcoholic beverages was illegal throughout the United States. Federal Prohibition agents were given the task of enforcing the law. Even though the sale of alcohol was illegal, alcoholic drinks were still widely available at &quot;speakeasies&quot; and other underground drinking establishments.&#10;&#10;Welcome to the Opulent, a posh speakeasy located in vibrant Atlantic City! In The Opulent 1-4 players are tasked with the operations of a successful nightclub during the historic Jazz Age. Each player takes on a distinct role that plays a vital part in the success &mdash; or failure &mdash; of the Opulent. Cater to the recognizable social classes of the 1920s. Politicians, mobsters, aristocrats, and social celebrities are all seeking a grand time in your club. Entertain your patrons with upbeat jazz tempos, or melodic waltzes, with the Opulent jazz band. Fancy the illegal indulgences of your patrons by preparing them an exotic mixed drink, a good whisky on the rocks, or even a simple brew. Pay lookouts to deter Federal Agents seeking to shut the club down. Hire flappers, a chanteuse, cocktail waitress, or other helpful hands and amenities to improve your club.&#10;&#10;Manage the Opulent in ten scenarios dating from 1920-1929 during one of the most historic periods of U.S. history! Each scenario has a dollar value that is associated with the cost of operating The Opulent for that particular year. Players must have enough money in the club coffers to cover this cost in order to win the scenario if playing a single session game, or to progress to the next scenario if players are taking on the Opulent campaign.&#10;&#10;With a focus on theme and history, &quot;The Opulent&quot; is a light cooperative asymmetrical game set during 1920's prohibition where players operate a campaign driven upscale speakeasy.&#10;&#10;",

A vast island chain, covered in the ruins of ancient civilizations, the Archipelago appears every few centuries, far out in the southern ocean. At such times, pirates, adventurers, wizards, and legendary heroes all descend upon the islands in the hopes of finding lost treasures and powerful artefacts. A few, drawn by the blood of their ancestors, search for the fabled Crystal Pool, whose waters grant abilities far beyond those of normal men. It is only the bravest, however, who venture into the islands, for they are filled with numerous deadly threats. Cannibal tribes, sorcerous snake-men, and poisonous water-beasts all inhabit the island ruins, guarding their treasure hordes and setting traps for the unwary.&#10;&#10;In the wargame Frostgrave: Ghost Archipelago, set in the world of Frostgrave, players take on the role of Heritors, mighty warriors whose ancestors drank from the Crystal Pool. These Heritors lead their small, handpicked teams of spellcasters, rogues, and treasure hunters into the ever-shifting labyrinth of the Ghost Archipelago. Using the same rules system as Frostgrave, this standalone wargame focuses on heroes who draw on the power in their blood to perform nigh-impossible feats of strength and agility. This game also includes thirty spells drawn from five schools of magic, a host of soldier types, challenging scenarios, treasure tables, and a full bestiary of the most common creatures that inhabit the Lost Isles.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "In Bushido: Der Weg des Kriegers (the subtitle means &quot;Way of the Warrior&quot;) players take on the roles of Daimyo, feudal lords in medieval Japan, and compete to become the next shogun of the empire, who gets appointed by the emperor. And this truly has to be an honorable man.&#10;&#10;Basically this game is all about resource management and conflict, but unlike other games in this category you won't necessarily win, if you conquer the most areas. Your main goal is to earn enough honor, which can be achieved in different ways. There are two kinds of honor. 'Daimyo-Honor' is the victory condition and can be directly gained by holding provinces, and indirectly by transforming 'Samurai-Honor' at a set rate. 'Samurai-Honor' is gained by winning a defensive or offensive battle. It can be transformed into 'Daimyo-Honor' with a tea ceremony.&#10;&#10;The first Daimyo who earns 50 points of honor wins the game. If this goal is not reached within 12 turns, the Daimyo with the most honor at that point wins the game.&#10;&#10;What needs special mentioning is the turn mechanism of the game, which is really cleverly-devised: depending on the number of players, different 'offices' are in the game that get assigned to the players. In a 4-player game these offices are:&#10;&#10;Daimyo: The active player. For clarification: in game terms, every player is a Daimyo, but only the active player acts as Daimyo. The Daimyo, as active player can restock his resources, attack a province and play special tiles. Most importantly, he assigns the other offices to his opponents.&#10;&#10;Samurai: The general. He will lead the attack in the Daimyo's name. He can earn 'Samurai-honor' with a successful attack.&#10;&#10;Bushi: the poor guy who is attacked by the Daimyo. He can earn 'Samurai-honor' with a successful defense.&#10;&#10;Sensei: He gives council to the Daimyo. Tricky position, because his council can do the Daimyo harm or good. He can cancel an attack, spy on other players, use Ronin to destabilize a province, and suggest to the Daimyo how hard to punish his Samurai    when he loses a battle.&#10;&#10;The battles are resolved by a system that depends on the number of troops and a rock-paper-scissors element. The opponents have the possibility to improve their odds by investing some of their resources.&#10;&#10;The tricky part of the game is that most of your actions depend at least partly on the goodwill of one of your opponents. For instance the Daimyo depends on the Samurai to win, but the Samurai will only do this, if he sees enough gain for himself. This makes the game very interactive, with much discussion and haggling at the table.&#10;&#10;",

To do so they first must dispatch opposing creatures.&#10;When a player suffers damage, they move their watchtower/castle card from left to right in their hand. If the building reaches the rightmost position, it is destroyed.&#10;Since the amount of cards in one's hand is the amount of mana the player gets at the beginning of their turn, and defeated creatures go back into your hand on the rightmost position, knowing which creature to play and which creature to let die is key to managing both your position on the board and your life total.&#10;&#10;",

The old bear found no joy in the beautiful scene though, he had survived enough winters to know the work that lay ahead. His mind reluctantly turned to thoughts of hunting and hoarding; stashing as much food as possible while the woodland was awake and bountiful.&#10;&#10;The bear&rsquo;s brooding was interrupted by an annoyingly cheerful voice:&#10;&ldquo;Look Huni, another big juicy berry! This will be our biggest stash yet!&rdquo;&#10;It was those two ridiculously radiant rabbits, Huni &amp; Bunz. As he watched the little bunnies bounce from bush to bush a cunning plan started to form. Maybe he wouldn&rsquo;t have to make such an effort this year? After all, there were plenty of other critters already hard at work! Ol&rsquo; Grizz pondered this new revelation. If he could apply a little pressure, maybe twist a tail or two, he might just be able to convince his new best friends to share...&#10;&#10;In Survival of the Fattest, you take the role of a woodland critter and use your unique tricks and abilities to forage for food. Spend your gathered food to complete delicious recipes from the Market for in-game bonuses and end-game victory points. After 3 seasons, if you&rsquo;ve fed your critter and accumulated the most victory points, you shall be declared the winner!&#10;&#10;Survival of the Fattest is a visually stunning family-weight game using action selection, hand management and unique critter abilities!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The cards available are determined by a number of warbands placed on the rondel. But warbands are also necessary for the tableau-building part, since the new buildings can be built only within the reach of the warband. Also, the resources available are determined with a similar way. The warband movement therefore plays a vital role in player&rsquo;s task to achieve victory. The consists of 6 interchangeable modules, each with 9 buildings. For each game players select 3 of those modules which grants a great replay value to the game.&#10;&#10;",

Will you play as a member of one of the criminal factions (Heisenberg, Los Pollos Hermanos, or the Juarez Cartel), trying to amass a fortune by manufacturing the biggest stash of Blue Sky while eliminating your rivals? Or will you join the ranks of the Drug Enforcement Administration, ready to slap the cuffs on the lawbreakers who would dare peddle their poison in your city?&#10;&#10;In more detail, when playing a criminal faction, your goal is to produce Blue Sky, then sell the quantity needed to win before your opponents can. You can also win the game by taking out all of your opponents by using cards to bomb, shoot, or otherwise eliminate them. As the DEA agent, your goal is to seize the criminal factions' labs (by playing DEA Raid cards). You can also win the game by taking out all of your opponents, either by killing them or putting them in jail. In game terms, on their turn, a player takes two of the following actions:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Draw a card.&#10;    Play a card from their hand.&#10;    Produce Blue Sky (dealer only).&#10;    Sell 1 Blue Sky on their faction board (dealer only).&#10;&#10;&#10;Be the one who knocks.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Though now largely forgotten the successful defense of Cholm by Kampfgruppe Scherer ranks as one of the great small unit sieges of the Second World War and perhaps of all time. Now you can relive the first ten days of this epic battle, when the underfed soldiers of the Soviet 3rd Shock Army attempted to capture the town, its food, and its vital road hub &ldquo;on the march&rdquo; and avoid what would ultimately become a long and unsuccessful siege. As the Soviet side you have more men, stronger artillery, and armor. As the German side you have the town, the high ground, and air power. Hitler has declared Cholm a festung: there will be no withdrawal. In the waist-deep snow and sub-zero temperatures the battle will be fought to the last man and the last grenade.&#10;&#10;Circle of Fire by designer Michael Rinella utilizes an updated version of the low-complexity area-impulse system first used in the award-winning Avalon Hill classic Storm over Arnhem. Unlike that game, however, this design includes a hallmark of later area-impulse games: the &ldquo;sudden death&rdquo; mechanism to end turns unpredictably. The game includes a full size area map produced directly from aerial photographs and situational maps, and 176 large counters. Easy to learn, quick to set up, and fast to play, Circle of Fire is both a great introduction to the area-impulse system and a great introductory conflict simulation game.&#10;&#10;&#10;    Map - One full-color 22&quot;x34&quot; mapsheet&#10;    Counters - 176 full-color 5/8&quot; die-cut pieces&#10;    Rules length - 8 pages&#10;    Charts and tables - 2 pages&#10;    Complexity - Low&#10;    Solitaire suitability - Low&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Leverage is an exciting board game of strategy with a unique action feature; it includes various weighted pieces and is built around universal laws of balance and force. Leverage has been hailed as a favorite of GAMES MAGAZINE in 4 different years.&#10;&#10;Rules and game pieces are simple and easy to understand, yet tactics and strategy can be as sophisticated and challenging as the players themselves. Two opposing strategies (speed &amp; sacrifice vs. conservation &amp; mass force) provide intrigue and depth, as either may be merged into the other as the game unfolds.&#10;&#10;Constant action potential -- Jump, capture, sacrifice, block; and, the players may rock the board at any time to see how the leverage advantage is changing.&#10;&#10;Suspense -- The board always stabilizes at a level position until a move is made that tilts it down to rest at one end; there is no halfway tilt!  When the board tilts down, scoring pegs are removed until it returns to level.&#10;&#10;The winner is (1)the one who tilts the board down towards his opponent when the opponent has no scoring pegs left to remove, or (2)the one who moves all of his remaining playing pieces into the opposite Safety Zone while having more or an equal number of scoring pegs than his opponent.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;From award-winning designer Ted S. Raicer, The Fall of the Third Reich covers the dramatic last two years of WWII in Europe, as the Western Allies and the Soviet Union fight against fierce German resistance to bring down the Thousand-Year Reich.&#10;&#10;The time is July, 1943. From the beaches of Sicily to the plains of central Russia, millions of men are poised to decide the fate of Europe and bring about the end of WWII...&#10;&#10;Two large hex maps cover Europe from France to Central Russia, and Leningrad to Sicily. Units are Armies, Corps, and in a few cases, Divisions. There are twelve two-month turns.&#10;&#10;Those turns play quickly, and yet there is a lot of subtlety within each one, with rules for both reaction and exploitation. Getting the most out of the various movement segments is essential for both players: as the Axis for plugging gaps in the front line, and as the Allies for exploiting every last opportunity to move ever further into the Third Reich proper. But the German player will quickly learn that a passive defense is doomed to fail, and that selective counterattacks are vital to hold the enemy at bay.&#10;&#10;The game includes rules for Soviet and German Command (Stavka), while the effects of Hitler's increasing interference in military affairs is presented through a rule which requires the German player to use OKW (West Front Headquarters) or OKH (East Front HQ) to be able to retreat infantry units from an enemy ZOC.&#10;&#10;While the Soviets and Germans begin the game locked in a death struggle at Kursk, the Allies face the early dilemma of where to invade, with a choice of invasion sites ranging from Holland to Greece. Knock Italy out of the war or Second Front Now! in Northwest Europe: the choices are yours.&#10;&#10;Supply rules have been kept as simple as possible, while still modeling the historic importance of logistics. The Western Allies in particular will learn the importance of ports in supplying their armies, and have to base their strategy around them.&#10;&#10;Perhaps most significantly, the game effectively models the Strategic Air War over Europe with only a few simple rules and a handful of counters. But though easy to learn, this &lsquo;game within a game&rsquo; can have a dramatic impact upon the course of the war, as the Allies must prioritize their air resources while the Luftwaffe struggles both to slow the Allied air offensive and support the German armies in the field. The challenges are numerous and subtle.&#10;&#10;Other rules cover variable (and degrading) German troop strength,  Allied Airborne drops, Strategic Transit, Forts, Yugoslav Partisans, and Axis Minor Powers, including Italian Surrender&#10;&#10;The game can be played by two (Axis and Allied/Soviet) or three players (Axis, Allied and Soviet) but also works well solo. The Fall of the Third Reich is a game of large scope and nail-biting decisions, combining fidelity to history with a fun playable game system.&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;Product Information&#10;Complexity: 5 out of 10&#10;Solitaire Suitability: 8 out of 10&#10;Time Scale: 1 turn = 2 months&#10;Map Scale: 1 hex = 30 miles&#10;Unit Scale: Armies, Corps and some Divisions&#10;Players: Best with 2 players but can be played well with 3 players or solitaire&#10;Playing Time: 6-10 hours&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Shibuya is a famous district and railway station in central Tokyo, famous for having the most busy pedestrian crossing in the world.&#10;&#10;The game SHIBUYA is a competitive puzzle game to guide pedestrians to their destinations. The game takes place at the heavily used pedestrian scramble at Shibuya, Tokyo. Pedestrians can successively move over adjoining grid's cells sharing the same color or shape, but they cannot move over the cells presently occupied by other pedestrians. Try to find your best route in the busy pedestrian scramble where people are rushing to all directions.&#10;&#10;In this puzzle game for two players, or for four as two teams (2 vs 2), first place the tiles to form the pedestrian scramble. The player or team who manages to have their pedestrians cross the street wins.&#10;&#10;Publisher's

With Legends of Boxing, I wanted fighter's styles to merge into certain types of action. That is the single biggest difference in this game and any that have come before it. The fighter's strategies, or modes, are an integral part of a his ratings in this game, reflecting his tendency to be defensive, fight from the outside, brawl on the inside, or &quot;walk down&quot; and pressure his opponent.&#10;&#10;I have played many hundreds of bouts with LOB since 2000 and I still enjoy it as much today as any other sports game I own. Perhaps even better, is that I have enjoyed sharing my hobby with hundreds of other gamers all over the world.&#10;&#10;It is now available through the online store at www.stonemountain.press&#10;&#10;",

It's time to begin the race! The first person to finish two laps will win.

The game lasts three rounds, and in each round, players play a card from their hand to advance their car on the track. If the player wins the trick, they move their car as much as the lowest number on the card played in the round. Other players wind up their spring, which can help to boost them along when they win a trick. As long as a player avoids winning a trick, they gain the chance to advance much more later &mdash; but too much winding makes your spring stop working!&#10;&#10;The player who first circles the track two times wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

Merchants from the rich provinces of Holland and neighboring Zealand gather in stately rooms to discuss the foundation of a mighty consortium: a company that will hold the monopoly of the very profitable East Indies trade.  One question occupies their minds more than anything: who will control the new company?&#10;&#10;Each player takes the role of a merchant living at the end of the sixteenth century.  These merchants sent out ships to explore and expand the profitable trade in the east, where they traded cloves, nutmeg, silk and tea in such remote areas as India, Indonesia, China and Japan.  These goods were then sold at great profit in the West.  The journey, however, was a dangerous one, and fitting out a ship was prohibitively expensive.  Merchants therefore cooperated in small groups, called compagnies in Dutch, to fit out ships together.&#10;&#10;At the same time, competition was cutthroat, not just abroad, but also at home, where Amsterdam was the most fearsome rival.  Your task in this game is to make as large a profit as you can - but at the same time uphold the honor of your hometown against the mighty merchants from Amsterdam.&#10;&#10;This box contains two game versions: the basic game, which can be played by 4 or 5 players, and the advanced game, for 3 to 5 players.  The basic game is suited for people aged 10 onwards and takes about an hour.

Once a market has a type of goods on it, only goods of the same type can be added to it. No market can have more than four cards on it, and the same good can by played into at most two markets. The player then refills his hand to seven cards.&#10;&#10;When all the markets have cards in them or two markets are full with four cards, the round ends. Each player reveals his secret stock; for each stock card that has a market devoted to it, the player scores 1-10 points, depending on the type of spice and the number of cards in the market. A player can score an identical spice card only if two markets carry this spice.&#10;&#10;Players clear the markets, then begin a new round.

    "description": "Geoff Noble - Designer&#10;&#10;On the 15th December 1899 General Sir Redvers Buller tried to cross the Thukela River in order to relieve the Siege of Ladysmith. He was faced by well entrenched Boer commandos who inflicted a reverse upon the British that ultimately led to Buller being relieved of command.&#10;&#10;Redvers Reverse is a solitaire area movement game that recreated the difficulties for the British in trying to affect a successful crossing of the Thukela against the Boer commandos (who are played by the game system).&#10;&#10;The game is at Battalion and Battery level with emphasis upon the leadership of the British at a Brigade level for Infantry and at Divisional level for the Cavalry.&#10;&#10;The key feature of the game is to present the player with the problems and difficulties that Buller himself faced. The player is provided with the same level of information and ability to influence events.&#10;&#10;Units are activated by orders sent from HQ to the various commanders, with the caveat that the receiving commander may not react as required. Orders remain in place until a rout or a commander initiative role. The nature of orders are to occupy a designated area.&#10;&#10;Combat is resolved rolling a 10 sided dice with a minimum number to hit. The impact on the two sides, from hits received, differs considerably due to the asymmetrical situation, both historically and in game terms. In addition there are numerous die modifiers for Dug in (mostly Boer), Terrain of area, Density of units in the area, Flank fire etc etc.&#10;&#10;Boer fire is usually determined by each Gruppe firing at the closest occupied area but there are certain designated exceptions.&#10;&#10;Besides combat loses units can become Disrupted, Suppressed or Rout. Leaders can Stand Firm or Panic. Both Units and Leader can recover from these postures during the Recovery Phase.&#10;&#10;For the British it is a race against time, the longer he delays the higher the Boer confidence goes, this is measured by a &lsquo;Confidence track&rsquo; which rises and falls according to events on the Battlefield. As the level of Boer confidence, alongside the extent of the Boer loses, is central to determining if the Boer retire and thus the British win, it must be kept low at all costs. This simple rule prevents the British concentrating against the Hlangwane and turning the Boer flank, he just hasn&rsquo;t got the time to redeploy his forces.&#10;&#10;There will also be a simple rule to handle Hart&rsquo;s confusion when trying to find a fordable crossing of the Thukela.&#10;&#10;The Boer Gruppe are in their historical positions but their exact Firepower can change slightly from turn to turn. The British player does not know the exact firepower of each Gruppe until they are engaged. As loses are inflicted upon the Boer&rsquo;s their firepower will slowly decline and the likelihood of them withdrawing slowly increase. Whether or not they withdraw is determined at the end of each game turn by revealing the full firepower available, the position on the &lsquo;Confidence track&rsquo; and a die role.&#10;&#10;The British can win but it won&rsquo;t be easy, the system will win most of the time. The intention is for the player to feel that if I give it one more go I can do it.&#10;&#10;Game scale:&#10;Map: 22&quot; x 34&quot; area map with a scale of 3&quot; to a mile.&#10;Units: Company/Battalion/Battery with individual leaders.&#10;Turn: 30 minutes each.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

In its place, newcomers to Panzer Grenadier are encouraged to start with Elsenborn Ridge: Tactical Combat During the Battle of the Bulge &#226;&#128;&#147; A Panzer Grenadier Game instead.&#10;&#10;Note - This is the second edition of Panzer Grenadier: Airborne.&#10;&#10;This game is part of the Panzer Grenadier series&#10;&#10;",

Players will gather medicine and equipment, employ accomplices, bribe the police, and perform shows &mdash; but not all plans run smoothly.

Performing shows in related sets grants fame bonuses, as does getting your name in the local newspapers. Grave-robbing in the night damages your reputation, but earns cash! At the end of a busy week, the player who has earned the most fame wins.&#10;&#10;This worker placement game features lots of action spaces because the emphasis is on timing your actions correctly to make the most of your limited resources.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Four-Player Chess (Four-handed chess, Chess-4, and 4-Chess) is often credited to Capt Charles Verney, who was the first known to have documented the game in England in 1881.  Four-player versions of chess probably have existed for hundreds of years prior to Verney in one form or another.  Verney's four-player board consists of three rows added to each side of a standard 2-player board, and four complete sets of chessmen in four different colors.  Modern four-player boards and colored pieces are available from several manufacturers.&#10;&#10;In Verney's version (1881), 4 player chess was a partnership game, and the object was to checkmate both opposing partners at the same time.  In modern variants, four player games can range from partners, to cutthroat (every player for himself), to temporary alliances at will.&#10;&#10;Starting configuration affects fairness (bias).  The standard 2-player configuration of queen facing queen is biased in four player chess because there is only one axis of symmetry.  Four player chess requires two axes of symmetry to be fair (unbiased).  To avoid bias, Verney recommended a staring configuration of all queens on light (or all on dark) squares.  Another unbiased starting configuration is all queens on the right (or all on the left) of the king.&#10;&#10;For the most part, four player chess follows (or can follow) all the normal rules of two-player chess.  Verney had special rules for partnership playing, disallowed castling, and pawns had to make it to the enemies last rank in order to be exchanged for another piece.  Pawns could also march up and back down the board.  Verney also had checkmate as the ultimate move.&#10;&#10;In modern variations of four-player chess, partnering may not be required, but allowable, castling can be allowed, and actual capturing of a king a required move to eliminate a player.  The Chess Federation does not recognize four-player chess in any form, and there are no official rules, so players are free to experiment with variations and make their own rules.&#10;&#10;See also:&#10;&#10;        Bughouse Chess&#10;        Vendetta&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Only recently have you discovered how to extract iron from the ore in the peat bogs, and it's best to use your new discovery before others use it against you. As a Teutonic lord, your duty is to ensure your family line is preserved and that your land prospers and grows. Of course, every other lord seems to be thinking the same thing.

Each god has a request and will help you to gain ground. You use the favor of the gods to aid your cause, and in return you appease their desires. In order to win you will need to appease the various gods in your deck. Appeasing gods requires dramatic losses to your position or the composition of your deck. When you appease the appropriate number of gods, the game ends, and whoever has appeased the most gods wins.&#10;&#10;The game board is composed of different landscape tiles: Mountains, Forest, Hills, Scrub, Bog, and Lakes. Each tile contains two different terrain types and an enchanted land. Players will create the board in the beginning of the game by joining the tiles together. City tiles are used to fill in some of the open square spaces on the map not used by enchanted lands. There are a number of different kinds of cards in the game: God Cards, Creature Cards, Town Item Cards, Enchanted Item Cards, and Event Cards. Players build a deck with cards to take over land and to battle each other.&#10;&#10;Asgard's Chosen plays with 2-4 players, and includes both a solitaire version and a two-player co-op version.&#10;&#10;",

American honor is being tarnished as the British Navy seizes American shipping and impresses her sailors in sight of her shores.  America launches a war to regain her honor and perhaps capture Canada from England, thus securing her northern border.  The war will see the burning of the White House by the British and a great battle won by America after the war is officially over.  The American Navy will distinguish itself against the greatest naval power in the world.  You are in command at New Orleans, Chippewa, Lundy's Lane, and many other land battles.  On the water in command of the Constitution and other ships, can you bring the British Navy to her knees?

As ChronoCops, agents of the most prestigious research department for time travel, the players travel through time to famous people and places where they have to solve puzzles. To do this, you need to bring the right things together to think outside the box, clear obstacles out of the way, and work together to stop the insane Professor Knix, the former mentor of the ChronoCops.&#10;&#10;The players explore different timelines, which can be opened up only gradually by successfully solving puzzles. Each timeline has different jump markers that players can travel to, some in the past or future, others in alternate realities. There are clues and objects hidden everywhere that the ChronoCops can collect and combine with the Chrono Decoder to use at a specific location. The group can also get tips on the back of the chrono-decoder if they get stuck.&#10;&#10;In ChronoCops: Da Vincis Universal-Dilemma (&quot;Da Vinci's Universal Dilemma&quot;), Professor Knix plans to drill into an underground river, but the ChronoCops can't allow that to happen! To stop the mad professor, they first have to recalibrate an LED in their chronograph, and to do that they need Leonardo da Vinci's help. But somehow Professor Knix has left behind chaos in the past &mdash; and also some annoying Cronks, the professor's strange helper beings.&#10;&#10;",

They don't know the island is the final home of dinosaurs, survivors of millions of years, and they aren't happy to let outsiders explore their island. Of course, the pirates also don't know that the island is sinking or that there are other pirates looking for the same treasure. Who will get away with the most loot and become the pirate remembered by history?&#10;&#10;Before the game, players outfit themselves with a variety of crew, weapons, and gear before choosing the section of the island that they will explore, knowing that the jungle takes longer than the beach as they look for their parts of the map. The search can be interrupted as other players play dinosaur (and other) cards to cause mayhem and carnage. Once the treasure is located, players draw treasures from a bag, looking to avoid the pirate ghost and island sinking events, and return safe to their ship &ndash; a question of how far they'll go in pushing their luck.&#10;&#10;",

All the while they must be wary of subterfuge from the other players, who they see as insidious imposters...&#10;&#10;Arkon is a fast paced strategy card game, played from one central deck of 52 cards. Players must win clans, either through a bidding process, that functions like an silent auction, or through using their cards as actions, to take other players clans. The first player to get each of the four clans, or four of one type of clan out into play, wins.&#10;&#10;Arkon hinges around a few central dynamics. First, cards can be played in multiple ways. Players will constantly be challenged to make tradeoffs, as they choose whether to use a card for some sort of advantage, keep it as a counter (all action cards can be countered by their matching action card) or use the card for its influence value to win a bid and move the player closer to winning the game. Because cards double as influence, and winning bids is a key component of your victory condition, Arkon reduces the &quot;dead card in hand&quot; phenomenon.&#10;&#10;Arkon pushes you to create a game plan but also to stay dynamic, as opponent's actions may force you down a different path. Because all players draw on each turn, you are constantly getting new cards in hand and new options to leverage.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "From the Introduction:&#10;&#10;The rules were originally written to address the author&rsquo;s passion for refighting ancient battles from Classical Greece, through the period of Macedonian dominance of the Eastern Mediterranean to the rise and eventual fall of the Roman Empire. However, in response to requests from play-testers, they have been extended to cover everything between the biblical era and the late medieval period.&#10;&#10;They have been designed so that they can be used for anything from solo play with 100 or so miniatures through to huge games with 3000 plus miniatures and up to 5 players a side. A square grid has been used to promote speed of play. This also enables figures which have been based on different frontages for use with a variety of rule systems to be used together on the same battlefield.&#10;&#10;Absolutely no dice are used in To the Strongest! Instead, an innovative (and entertaining) mechanism uses playing cards to activate units, which can each potentially move or fight multiple times during the same turn. Shooting and melees are resolved quickly and decisively, amidst a flurry of playing cards....&#10;&#10;Despite their relative simplicity, the author believes that these rules capture the essential flavour of an ancient or medieval battle, and that the more seasoned gamer will find more than enough command decisions to entertain and challenge him. He wishes that players may enjoy very many happy games, and may victory always fall to the strongest!&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "ScrumBrawl is a board game where players control fantastic creatures vying for supremacy within the Arena, scoring goals by maneuvering various types of enchanted orbs into portals set within the Arena or fighting other creatures to the death to prevent them from reaching the portals. The 100-card deck contains fifty creatures with different characteristics that determine how the creature interacts with the orbs (throw accuracy, catching ability, and throwing range), how fast a creature can move, and how effective it is in battle. Many creatures also have unique magic abilities that can be used to manipulate gameplay.&#10;&#10;When players summon creatures, corresponding creature tokens (miniature cards that stand erect in cardstands) enter the 20x20 square gameboard, known as the Arena, where the orb and portal tokens await the contestants. In a four-player game, players may compete in teams of two. Goals are scored by creatures that maneuver an orb token onto a portal token by picking up, carrying, handing off, and throwing the orb with their creature tokens. Additionally, players can score goals (known as Skins) by successfully destroying opponents' creatures in combat. Combat results are determined by dice rolls as are the success of throws and catches of the orb between creatures. A number of Alter Reality cards allow players to change the values of individual rolls which make the outcome of every roll something that can quickly be challenged.&#10;&#10;Enchantment cards can be played on creatures to grant them enhanced stats or new abilities as well as make them hardier in combat. Event cards, such a Lightning Storms or Fumbles can change the flow the game in seconds forcing players to constantly rethink their strategies for scoring or engaging in combat.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player or team reaches three goals, one of which must be a non-skins goal. No lead is safe and no two matches are ever the same making each game a unique and often humorous experience. The name is the combination of Scrum (a Rugby term where players strive for possession of the ball) and Brawl (a roaring fight, in our case, to the death). ScrumBrawl is the inaugural title for VicTim Games LLC.&#10;&#10;Game time ranges from 20-40 minutes for a 2 player game, 30-45 minutes for a 3 player game, and 40-60 minutes for a 4 player game.&#10;&#10;",

To play, choose one card from your hand simultaneously and put it face down in front of you. Reveal your chosen card simultaneously. Place cards into your caf&eacute;, respecting the order of initiative, and choose whether to resolve their effects.&#10;&#10;SCORING&#10;At the end of the round, review your caf&eacute; from left to right to see which objectives have been fulfilled. Each card has one objective, which earns you coins if you have that card in your caf&eacute; and you fulfill its requirements. If a Group card has been placed in front of a card, that card&rsquo;s coin reward is either doubled or tripled, depending on which half of the Group points towards you. Add up all the coins you have earned from your objectives. If you have earned the most coins, you win the round and receive 1 Tip card. If you now have 2 Tip cards, the game ends and you win! Otherwise, set up the next round and continue playing.&#10;&#10;",
