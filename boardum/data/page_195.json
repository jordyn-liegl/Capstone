    "description": "One of the original set of Avalon Hill &quot;Adult Games&quot; that includes U-Boat, Tactics II, Verdict, and Dispatcher.&#10;&#10;This is one of the earliest &quot;typical&quot; wargames, with movement/strength counters, order of appearance chart, CRT, etc.&#10;&#10;Board has square grid with squares 1&quot; = 1/4 mile. One hour turns.&#10;&#10;27 Confederate counters&#10;41 Union counters&#10;&#10;Units include infantry, artillery, cavalry, HQs (but had no use), and outposts (pickets, not in '64 Ed.).&#10;&#10;Roberts redesigned this game in 1961 with hexagons.  Although it sold out, Roberts wasn't happy with it.  He then re-released it in 1964 with squares again, like the 1958 version.  However, the rules were significantly changed.&#10;&#10;The 1958 version was basically a miniatures game on a map.  You used range cards (shown in the illustration) both to move your units and then to check their firing range.  Units could rotate on their centers before checking with a range card, which was placed along the front side of the rectangular pieces.  You got better odds hitting from a flank.  Artillery had double range the of infantry or cavalry (this was only optional as far as I know). There were at least 3 slightly different rule books for the '58, '59, &amp; '60 Ed., all were basically the '58 one.&#10;&#10;The game also had optional rules for hidden movement.  You left the room while your opponent put his pieces on the board and moved them, recorded their new positions and removed them again!  If they came within sight of a unit (including an outpost unit), he had to tell you where they were seen, or leave them on the board if still in sight.  Line of sight rules for all this.&#10;&#10;The 1964 version required you to keep your units aligned with the square grid rather than the free form miniatures style movement of the 1958 version. This really didn't work well. Units facing diagonally had to be adjacent to form a solid wall of ZOC sqs. to their front and could not therefore protect their flanks if they spread out any at all. This made doubled and tripled attacks easily possible.&#10;&#10;Every version would benefit from a road movement bonus rule, x3 at a minimum (but x4 would be better, units that move this fast should not be able to attack that turn, though).&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "From the Decision Games' website:&#10;&#10;In September 1944, Operation Market Garden was intended to open a direct path for the Allied armies to circumvent the West Wall and threaten Germany's industrial Ruhr heartland. British, American and Polish airborne forces were ordered to assault and capture key bridges along the main highway leading through Holland, the Arnhem bridge being the most distant of them all. Unfortunately, the Allies had gravely underestimated the strength of German forces in the area; so, when the airborne forces landed, they found themselves scattered amid an SS panzer division. The various bridges thus became the fulcrum of the entire operation for both sides.&#10;&#10;Arnhem utilizes the new Fire &amp; Movement combat system that's designed so players can augment their units with &quot;support fire&quot; during the course of the turns. From mortars to self-propelled artillery, units can receive support assets to engage enemy positions and formations, allowing combat to develop at all levels. A single recon battalion, for example &mdash; perhaps supported by tanks &mdash; could be tasked to assault a lone enemy paratrooper battalion defending a landing zone. As that attack gets underway, however, the recon battalion may find itself strafed by enemy fighter-bombers. More support will be necessary to take the landing zone, but assets are limited.&#10;&#10;In Arnhem, the attritional design of the new Combat Results Table simulates the true nature of battles in Europe. Units are typically two-sided formations that can incur casualties, accurately replicating the realities of combat and the high losses sustained by both sides during the actual fighting for Arnhem. Winning the battle is thus a matter of maneuver, firepower and asset management.&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    A Bridge Too Far: Arnhem&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Each time a roll is made one or more scoring dice must be removed and the player can chose to stop with the total score they have accumulated or roll on. If no score is made on a roll, the player zilches and all the accumulated score for that turn (not from previous turns)is lost (like Can't Stop). If all the dice are used for scoring then the turn continues with all 6 dice again.&#10;&#10;Scores are &#10;5=50&#10;1=100&#10;3 of a kind = kind X 100&#10;&#10;On a 6 dice roll: 1,2,3,4,5,6 = 1500   &#10;and 3 pairs = 1000 (though six 6s can be 1200 from two triples of 600)&#10;&#10;To win a player knocks instead of rolling on their turn and each other player has one turn to pass the leaders score.&#10;&#10;Also there is an optional rule for the start: A score of less than 500 can not be kept until you are on the board and if a player Zilches on their first three turns they go negative whatever score they had before the final roll of their third turn and can subsequently stop at any score.&#10;&#10;The game is suspenseful as players roll diminishing numbers of dice against increasing odds. It can have longish down time unless you decide to have several players having their turns at the same time with different sets of dice. (faster but less suspenseful).&#10;&#10;",

The game ends when a player reaches 500 points, lowest score wins.&#10;    The Totally Insane Card Game has numbered cards 0-10 and 27 action cards such as the Change Hands.   If you do not like the cards in your hand, you think another player MAY have a better hand, play the Change Hands to the discard pile and change hands with him.  Other examples of action cards are the Moving Cards, these cards when played, will move the entire hand of all players ether two players left or one player right. The Totally Insane Card Game includes Draw 2, Draw 4, and Take 2, cards that make the next player ether Draw 2 or Draw 4 cards from the draw pile, or Take 2 cards from any player. Of course the draw cards add together so you might have to draw 6 or 8 cards. In Totally Insane, players could take cards from your hand, helping you get rid of your cards, while adding cards to their hand.  The Totally Insane Card Game has a Totally Useless Card this card is exactly what it says totally useless.  At no time can the Totally Useless Card be played to the discard pile.  So what do you do with a card you can&rsquo;t play to the discard pile?   Simple, you give it to anther player so he can&rsquo;t play it either. (If you can&rsquo;t play it, you can&rsquo;t go out.) You can give it away with cards like the Change Hands, Moving Card, or a Forced Kindness.  When you play a Forced Kindness to the discard pile, you give two cards from your hand to any player.  You never know who will be picked on next.  The Totally Insane Card Game boasts one Dead Card, any time this card is played to the discard pile, the hand is over immediately all players add the points of there cards, then deal the next hand.  This is just a sample of the action cards and how they play.  &#10;    The Totally Insane Card Game is designed to play in turn and out of turn, (matching) so you must be alert, or you may miss an opportunity to play a card.  &#10;    The Totally Insane Card Game is fast moving and outrageous fun, for 4 to 12 players Ages 8 and up. &#10;Find us at totallyinsanecardgame.com&#10;&#10;",

The infighting among the city's major factions has only increased since war's end and the city itself faces utter destruction as the dangers of the surrounding wilderness grow. Without leadership the city will soon fall. There must be one who can unite the city under their leadership and restore order. You must be this one.&#10;&#10;Welcome to Allegiance: War of Factions, a collectible card game where each player takes the role of a lord or lady vying for control of a mighty city. Extend your influence in an attempt to control the city's major political, religious, and economic powers. While fighting for control, it may even be necessary to join forces with those who you would call your enemies as the city itself stands on the brink of being overrun by the denizens of the wild.&#10;&#10;So then, to which Factions will you make your call for support? House Mosfin? Is the strength of Droman Tregorian and his house sufficient to stand with on your way to dominance? Or would your ties to the Goddess Kalim better serve your efforts? Surely those who support the Glory of Kalim would recognize your true strength and the divine calling which Kalim, herself, has given you. Yet, there are those veterans, men of honor and war, who have the taste of freedom and blood fresh on their tongues. Perhaps your call to them to follow you yet again into battle would give you the strength needed to claim control over the city. The decision is yours - but choose wisely who you would call friend, for in this trying time it is unsure where their allegiances lie.&#10;&#10;Allegiance: War of Factions introduces a unique system of play which allows everyone to become more involved in every phase of the game. Why sit back waiting for your enemies to make their move when you can stop them before they even get the chance? Form alliances, threaten your enemies, back-stab your friends, hoard the city's resources - the choice is yours!&#10;&#10;",

A massive German riposte led by the XLVIII Panzerkorps stuck the Soviet flank and rolled back some of the initial Soviet Gains.  In December, additional German efforts pushed in the Soviet forces around Korosten.

In Goblin Grapple, the goblin clans are at war, and your goal is to unite the clans by proving your strength in battle.&#10;&#10;In Goblin Grapple, players race to gain points by collecting goblins in battle.  The goal of the game is to collect 100 points worth of goblins over multiple rounds of play.  Players start the game with 5 goblin cards and can use them to build their armies and challenge their opponents. Some goblins have special abilities, like the spy, which can be played to steal another player&rsquo;s card.&#10;&#10;Goblin cards are secretly played into armies, which are worth points at the end of the round, with the last goblin card played being revealed when entering battle. On your turn you will start by drawing a card and then taking as many actions as you&rsquo;d like.  To play a goblin into your army, play one card face down in front of you, creating a stack of cards. These cards will defend you if you are attacked by another player.&#10;&#10;To challenge another player&rsquo;s army, choose a player, and play a goblin from your hand face-up. The defender will then reveal their last army card played.  The stronger goblin wins the battle, unless special goblin abilities are activated, and the winning player will take all face up cards from the battle, placing them into their garrison. Once a garrison reaches 21 points or more, the round ends.  All players will add points from their garrison and army to their total score.&#10;&#10;Do you have what it takes?  Will you be the next Goblin Emperor?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "The classic SPI game covering the battle of Waterloo returns in this redesigned version. Napoleon's French Army of the North faces Wellington's hodge-podge Army of the Low Countries, who are fighting for time while awaiting the arrival of Blucher's Prussian Army of the Lower Rhine. The maps use natural contours to show elevations, withterrain features including the critical chateaux, villages and farms, walls, woods, hedges, sunken roads, slopes, streams, and marshes.&#10;&#10;Most of the vividly colored counters represent combat units: infantry battalions, cavalry squadrons, artillery batteries, and engineer detachments. Many battalions have additional counters for specialist skirmishers, or additional counters to represent greater size. Unit capabilities are modified by a number of formation markers, from infantry squares to cavalry vedettes. Individual leaders enhance unit performance, while each army's high command is represented by key commanders and unit headquarters.&#10;&#10;The game mechanics have been streamlined; a single dice roll inflicts casualties and disorder. Units and larger organizations wear down over time and must be rested or risk a catastrophic collapse. Finesse trumps brute strength in combat; players must utilize a variety of arms, formations, and tactics to seize key ground and destroy enemy units. Hidden movement allows each player to prepare surprises for the other. Multiple scenarios cover everything from the historical battle to a fight for an individual chateau. The French player may decide on an early start, or even on turning the battle into a demonstration.&#10;&#10;The Prussian arrival can occur early with fewer troops, or later with more, at the will of the allied player. It's all here, from massive cavalry charges to grand bombardments to skirmishing to wild melees, with the fate of Europe in the balance.&#10;&#10;Game Components:&#10;&#10;1 32-page Color Rules Book&#10;1 16-page Color Battle Analysis &amp; OB (extract from S&amp;T #292)&#10;7 Counter Sheets (1,960 die-cut counters)&#10;4 34&quot; x 22&quot; soft maps&#10;2 Player Aid Sheets&#10;1 Time Display Sheet&#10;3 Army Display Sheets&#10;1 Prussian Off-Board Approach Sheet&#10;6 6-Sided Large Dice&#10;Storage Bags&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "MARK is a game about collecting, processing, and reselling recycled components for a profit. Each turn, a player rolls a pair of color dice and chooses one of the showing die colors to perform an action with. Each color is tied to one type of recyclable material. A player can choose to receive a single new recyclable good to his delivery yard, or he can choose to move a single recyclable good from his delivery yard to his treatment area, or he can choose to sell one good from his treatment area to the market grid in the center of the board.&#10;&#10;The market grid has 5 rows, and each row can hold only one variety of recyclable materials. When selling to the market, if it is the first time that good has been sold, the player may choose which row to sell into (left-most position in the row only), otherwise he must sell into the next empty space in the row that variety already occupies. He receives the amount of money shown on the space where he places his recyclable good. When the row is full, all goods of that type are removed from the game. The game ends when four of the market rows are completely filled.&#10;&#10;If the player rolls both dice of the same color, he has no choice in which recyclable material to choose, but may perform two actions (delivery, treatment, or sale) with that type of good. In addition, there are two special symbols on the dice (one on each). One is a star symbol, which acts as a wild. The player can choose whatever color he desires. The other is a gavel, which triggers an immediate auction for the type of good shown on the other die, after which the player takes another turn. The auction is a closed-fist auction.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the player's turn, he must pay 5 dollars in storage fees if he has more than 2 recyclable materials in his delivery yard. He must also pay 5 dollars in storage fees if he has more than 2 recyclable materials in his treatment area. This provides tension between waiting for bigger pay-outs and selling recyclable materials early.&#10;&#10;The player with the most money at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "From the Avalanche Press website:&#10;&#10;At the end of November 1939, the Red Army sent about 450,000 men into Finland in an attempt to conquer the Soviet Union&rsquo;s much smaller neighbor. In what became known as the Winter War, ferocious Finnish resistance soon shocked the world and inflicted repeated defeats on the invaders.&#10;&#10;The Soviet plan included attacks in the dark forests of Eastern Karelia, attempting to outflank the stout line of Finnish fortifications to the south. Their 139th Rifle Division advanced in early December 1939 along the river Aittijoki, faced by only a handful of Finnish battalions. The Finns panicked in some places, and a near-rout seemed inevitable. Finnish Marshal Carl Gustav Mannerheim sent a small group of reinforcements led by Col. Paavo Talvela, previously in charge of buying artillery ammunition for the army.&#10;&#10;Talvela proved that a warrior lived within the bureaucrat, as he put new heart into his men and stemming the Soviet advance. After heavy fighting, the Finns had destroyed the 139th Rifle Division and routed the 75th Rifle Division. But they suffered serious losses as well, as the Soviets here had committed ski troops of their own including the &ldquo;Red Finns&rdquo; seldom mentioned by Finnish writers.&#10;&#10;Winter Fury re-creates the twin battles of Tolvaj&auml;rvi and Ilomantsi from 1939, as well as the 1941 Finnish offensive over the same ground. It uses a &ldquo;variable impulse&rdquo; game system to model the two armies&rsquo; very different capabilities. Each turn, each player puts a number of markers into a common container. These are then drawn one by one, the number drawn varying with the current weather condition. The Finnish player has weaker forces, but will usually draw more markers and these allow the Finns to conduct more operations. The good Finnish units are better than the Soviet ones, and more mobile in the forests. The Soviet cannot move his or her divisions together, complicating the Red Army&rsquo;s efforts. But Soviet artillery is very powerful while Finnish guns are little more than a nuisance. The Soviet player also has tanks and armored cars, which not only are powerful in battle (at least on the roads), they also might cause the Finns to panic and run away.&#10;&#10;Winter Fury is the second in our line of Playbooks: a 64-page book about the battle and the forces involved that also includes a complete historical game on the subject. The book includes a lengthy background piece by David Lippman as well as rules, scenarios and other historical data. There are 280 playing pieces and a 34x22-inch map.&#10;&#10;",

Build armies and fleets, build more cities, make and break alliances, spy on your opponents, and go to war to conquer all of Europe.&#10;&#10;Players have up to five armies and fleets to move and attack with on a large 38x28 inch map of Europe which accurately depicts Europe in 1000 C.E. Each army can contain six types of combat units: Knights, Heavy Cavalry, Light Cavalry, Heavy Infantry, Light Infantry or Peasant troops. Fleets can contain warships, Raider ships, or Transports for moving your armies. Every season you can build more units into your armies or fleets to have a better chance of capturing more territories. More cities can also be built to increase income without the need to capture territory. Combat occurs between armies by using a unique combat system that gives a feel of your troops lining up on the battle field and facing off. The system uses 2d6 to determine outcomes.&#10;&#10;Will the Byzantine Empire rise again and give rebirth to the glory and ancestors of Ancient Rome?&nbsp;Can the upstart Kievan Rus Empire bring a new golden age of Slavic Culture and power?&nbsp;Or will the Fatimid Caliphate push further into Europe and create an even greater Muslim Empire?&#10;&#10;",

For each suit, if a player hits their bid, they earn one point per trick.  However, if a player does not hit their bid exactly, they lose 1 point for each trick they were off. Zero trick bids are also possible.&#10;&#10;The player with the most points after a certain number of rounds wins.&#10;&#10;",

In some villages, you trade your wares for other wares.  In other villages, for your wares, you receive wampum--bands of shells and beads used as currency by American Indians--and subsequently the white European settlers as well. The types of wares you are trading and the types in the village where you are trading determine whether you will get wares or wampum.&#10;&#10;Clever trading in the right village at the right time is the key to collecting the most wampum and winning the game.&#10;&#10;The game won second prize in the 2009 Hippodice Game Design Competition.&#10;&#10;",

They can also carry out a mission or send the people to raid the dens of other Stworza.

Each week a team of three contestants tries to complete a Level by running along narrow pathways that hover high in the sky. The better they perform, the more credits they win.&#10;At random intervals gaps appear in these tracks, over which players must jump, or otherwise fall onto the pathway below. &#10;And large mutant creatures, known as Blockers, are also waiting to try to stop their progress.&#10;&#10;The aim of this solitaire micro game is to win as many credits as you can!&#10;Each Level consists of 3 tracks (high, mid and low), divided into 7 Zones (cards). The game has 3 Levels, each getting progressively more difficult.&#10;Runners who successfully reach a Level&rsquo;s End Zone are awarded points (credits), depending on the height of track and the Level. A runner who completes one Level can then tackle the next one (hopefully with their other team mates if they also finished it).&#10;You control a team of 3 Runners. You&rsquo;ll be rolling dice and deciding how best to assign them so that each Runner has the best chance of progressing. Runners also have special abilities that can modify their dice score.&#10;&#10;Zone Runners was voted Best Solitaire Game in the 2017 9-card Nanogame PnP Design Contest.&#10;It was also voted 2nd Best Overall Game.&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#10;EXPANDED EDITION&#10;This edition adds 2 expansions, 4 character ability reference cards, an updated turn tracker card and card backs. &#10;Available from both PNP Arcade https://www.pnparcade.com/products/zone-runners and Randomskill Games https://randomskill.games/product/zone-runners/&#10;&#10;",

Played with different colored sailing ships and on a beautiful large world map board, the game is set in the year 1806, at the peak of Napoleon's power. The game is played on three levels: the first level is rolling dice and moving one of six cargoes indicated on cargo cards from one port/continent to another, avoiding ever changing bad weather and war zones, lest you sink at sea.&#10;&#10;The second level features pirates that every player gets a chance to be, by the pick of specially marked new cargo cards, once your voyage is complete. Pirates need not reveal themselves until they so desire. Poker face is critical to this game. Pirates can attack merchant ships by rolling additional dice. Knowing when to hold and when to attack are critical to success. However, there are also a few Lord Nelsons at sea - the game's police force -  that can Neutralize pirates.&#10;&#10;Finally, there is the most exciting third level; the Secret Treasure Islands. With every game there is at least one, truly secret treasure worth 50,000 pounds that makes the game a fun, fast, in your face adventure. Since the location of these treasures changes from game to game, no two games are ever the same and although the better strategists more often than not win this game, no one is ever really out of it. The emotional intensity of the game often increases into a climactic finish.&#10;&#10;The Box and Board are beautifully designed, money comes in British pounds (paper), ships are wooden and painted with different colored sails, ship manifests are included to keep record of your payouts, and variously colored lighthouses mark where you start and where you end. Weighs 3.3 lbs.&#10;&#10;",

In 1941 Erwin Rommel arrived in North Africa to save the collapsing Italian empire. Among the units under his command was the Deutches Afrika Korps.

    "description": "Operation Peace for Galilee&#10;&#10;Lebanon &lsquo;82 is a simulation of the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in &lsquo;82, an attempt to clear out PLO terrorists and expel elements of the Syrian army from the country. Hoping to establish the pro-Israeli Christians as the legitimate government in Lebanon, the Israelis sent in the IDF, which soon became embroiled in vicious urban battles. The game also includes a 1975 scenario, as well as a 2006 scenario, showing the evolution of Israel&rsquo;s ongoing struggle against the PLO.&#10;&#10;Lebanon &lsquo;82 utilizes the Fire &amp; Movement combat system that is designed so that players can augment their units with &ldquo;Support Fire&rdquo; during the course of the battle. From artillery to air strikes, units can receive support assets to engage enemy positions and formations, allowing combat to develop at all levels. Lebanon &lsquo;82 also includes rules for a possible Syrian entry, and features the Syrian Surface to Air Missiles! Israeli air support could come under fire from Syrian fixed SAM batteries; more support fire will be necessary, but assets are limited.&#10;&#10;In Lebanon &lsquo;82, the attritional design of the Combat Results Table simulates the true nature of modern warfare; Units are typically two-sided formations that can incur casualties during a game, accurately replicating the realities of combat, especially during the street fighting encountered in 1982. Winning the battle is thus a matter of maneuver, firepower and asset management &mdash; not merely odds ratios requiring numerical superiority. A stunning map of Lebanon depicts the entire battle area, ranging from the Israeli border to the capital Beirut itself &mdash; including all of the famous battle sites, such as the PLO refugee camps.&#10;&#10;",

In this variant the secondary attribute (color of stripes &amp; Helmets) has to fit, too.&#10;- The second side of the game board features obstacles (looping, jump) that need special sounds.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the first car finishes one round.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "BABEL is a balancing game in which players make a tower of paper by building walls of different heights. This game has three modes of play: hidden identity mode (saboteurs may exist), limited communication co-operative mode (players use strange languages - frog, robot, dog, cat, no words), and random co-operative mode (players may not choose walls).&#10;&#10;In hidden identity mode, players are secretly assigned a role: Builder or Saboteur (Fanatic is the 2nd Edition). A Builder's goal is to build an eight-tier tower, and a Saboteur's goal is to make one of the builders collapse the tower.&#10;&#10;The 2nd edition, published in 2017, kept the gameplay the same, but made significant changes to the components of the 1st edition (2016). The original edition had the player's Height cards also acting as the actual floors of the tower. The Height card had a sort of Pac-man shape. By combining two pieces, you made the hexagonal floor you would build. The player building the level was meant to arrange the floor parts to match the wall parts. That is, if the heights combined are a 3 and a 5, the 3-wall goes over the 3-floor, and the 5-wall goes over the 5-floor.&#10;&#10;The 2017 edition did away with this physical mechanism; instead, players had normal playing cards numbered 1 to 5, and wholly separate floor tiles to actually build with. This edition also introduced a new card 'Break Down The Wall', which means that only one wall piece is used in the level being built. Also, in the new edition, the tower starts with a floor, and on your turn you place two walls and then the floor. The new edition also has a sturdier box and is slightly larger.&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;Each player has three cards in their hand. In your turn, you place a floor card, which is numbered 1-5, face-up, and other players place a floor card face-down, saying a hint (saboteurs might be misleading you). Then you choose and reveal one of these face-down cards (the unused go unseen to a discard pile), take a floor tile (in the 2016 edition - combine the chosen card with yours to make a hexagonal floor), and take two walls that correspond to the floor numbers. You must place the floor and the walls on top of tower without making it collapse. Height of walls gradually vary over floor numbers, so you should pick the same number if you want to build an upright tower.&#10;&#10;If you are a saboteur, it's up to you whether you secretly or explicitly betray the builders. You may try to mislead builders to take unbalanced walls, or boldly build up a skewed tower in your turn. But beware. Your side loses the game if you make the tower collapse yourself. You may also reveal your identity during your turn, in which case builders need to complete one more floor to win the game.&#10;&#10;In the co-operative mode, players may loosely discuss which card ought to be selected (you cannot say obvious info, such as 'my card is a 3!'). But discussions are done in foreign languages - dog, cat, frog, robot, and no words. You are dealt a card and can only use your given language to communicate.&#10;&#10;The game can be played as a solitaire but only in random mode. You randomly take two floor cards and use the corresponding walls to build one tier. Repeat the process until you build 12-tier tower without it falling.&#10;&#10;There is an instructional manga by &#228;&#184;&#131;&#232;&#137;&#178;&#230;&#180;&#139;&#229;&#147;&#129;&#229;&#186;&#151; (Nanairo Youhinten) in the first edition. The second edition has a manga by Ayame Gonta (&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#129; &#227;&#130;&#180;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#229;&#164;&#170;). These are online on the Game Market webpage for the game (see links below).&#10;&#10;Publisher's summary&#10;BABEL is a dexterity game where you build a tower using walls of&#10;unoriented heights.&#10;You may play the game in 3 variations:&#10;&#10;     Hidden identity mode - the traitor secretly tries to collapse the tower&#10;     Co-op mode - as postfin of the myth, build with limited communications&#10;     Solitaire mode - build the tower as high as you can with random draw of walls&#10;&#10;&#10;Difference between the first edition and the 2017 new version:&#10;The following improvements were made from the version sold at TGM2016.&#10;1: Introduced the &quot;Height Card&quot;. No need to combine the floor cards anymore.&#10;2: Introduced the &quot;Break down the wall&quot; card. When played, the active&#10;player must build the tower with only 1 wall card this turn.&#10;3: Construction order for each turn altered, from floor=&gt;wall to wall=&gt;floor.&#10;4: More sturdier box.&#10;&#10;BABEL&#227;&#129;&#175;&#228;&#184;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#158;&#227;&#130;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#169;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#191;&#228;&#184;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#161;&#148;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#174;&#140;&#230;&#136;&#144;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#131;&#144;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#232;&#163;&#143;&#229;&#136;&#135;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#232;&#128;&#133;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#230;&#154;&#151;&#232;&#186;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#230;&#173;&#163;&#228;&#189;&#147;&#233;&#154;&#160;&#229;&#140;&#191;&#227;&#131;&#162;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#231;&#165;&#158;&#232;&#169;&#177;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#190;&#140;&#230;&#151;&#165;&#232;&#171;&#135;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#230;&#165;&#189;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#229;&#174;&#140;&#229;&#133;&#168;&#229;&#141;&#148;&#229;&#138;&#155;&#227;&#131;&#162;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#128;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#169;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#128;&#231;&#165;&#158;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#136;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#131;&#162;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;1&#227;&#131;&#145;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#130;&#177;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#184;&#227;&#129;&#167;3&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#162;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#230;&#165;&#189;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;&#229;&#136;&#157;&#231;&#137;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#168;2017&#229;&#185;&#180;&#230;&#150;&#176;&#231;&#137;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#233;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#239;&#188;&#154;&#10;2016&#229;&#185;&#180;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#153;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#128;&#142;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#131;&#158;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#177;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#128;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#233;&#160;&#146;&#229;&#184;&#131;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#229;&#136;&#157;&#231;&#137;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#228;&#184;&#139;&#232;&#168;&#152;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#231;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#230;&#148;&#185;&#232;&#137;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#239;&#188;&#145;&#239;&#188;&#142;&#233;&#171;&#152;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#231;&#149;&#170;&#229;&#143;&#183;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#176;&#142;&#229;&#133;&#165;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#141;&#138;&#229;&#136;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#186;&#138;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#181;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#191;&#229;&#144;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#229;&#191;&#133;&#232;&#166;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#239;&#188;&#146;&#239;&#188;&#142;&#229;&#163;&#129;&#230;&#159;&#177;1&#230;&#158;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#230;&#148;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#128;&#136;&#231;&#160;&#180;&#229;&#163;&#138;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#128;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#232;&#191;&#189;&#229;&#138;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#239;&#188;&#147;&#239;&#188;&#142;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#231;&#149;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#187;&#186;&#232;&#168;&#173;&#232;&#161;&#140;&#231;&#168;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#186;&#138;&rarr;&#229;&#163;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#229;&#163;&#129;&rarr;&#229;&#186;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#164;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#143;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#239;&#188;&#148;&#239;&#188;&#142;&#231;&#174;&#177;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#233;&#160;&#145;&#228;&#184;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;BABEL&#227;&#129;&#175;&#228;&#184;&#141;&#230;&

    "description": "The hook of the party game Let's Hit Each Other with Fake Swords is that...you get to hit each other with fake swords. Why you're doing that is to claim action cards. Collect three cards of a color, and you have a set; collect three sets before anyone else, and you win.&#10;&#10;Each round, the fight boss divides cards into piles, then after a countdown of 3-2-1, everyone points to the pile they want. If no one else has pointed at your pile, take that pile and place those cards (or card) in front of you. If no one points at a pile, discard that pile. If multiple people point at a pile (or multiple piles have multiple people pointing at them), the fight boss chooses which two people pointing at the same pile will fight, and those players then try to hit one another with fake swords &mdash; but they must follow all of the rules on the cards over which they are fighting. Maybe you have to stand on one leg or wield the sword without bending your elbow or keep a running count of the things the fighters hit...or maybe you have to do all three of those things!&#10;&#10;If the fight boss sees a fighter violate a rule &mdash; such as disobeying a card or hitting an opponent on the head or arm &mdash; the other fighter wins. If a fighter hits their opponent on the chest or back (or meets the victory condition on a card), they claim all of the cards in that pile. Everyone else who was pointing at the same pile as someone else gets nothing.&#10;&#10;",

It is also, fortunately, a game whose practical details can be learned in 15 minutes or less, in spite of the apparent complexity of the rules.  Having been told how to maneuver his ship by the speed-scale and how to lay the firing arrows, the rest is up to the individual's keenness of eye and his ability to keep cool amid excitements.&#10;&#10;",

The arena however is designed to make this difficult, 16 square tiles each comprised of four spaces with walls and falling floors restricting the robots' movement.&#10;&#10;Players move their robot in straight lines and rotate tiles to change the layout of the arena to their advantage, creating routes to allow them to destroy another robot or limiting an opponent&rsquo;s possible moves and trapping them. Another feature of the arena is that once a robot leaves a space it falls away leaving a space that cannot be occupied. As the game progresses these spaces reduce the robots&rsquo; possible moves, forcing them together into a final showdown.&#10;&#10;A game of Robot Royale is won when a player reaches their goal, three points in an average game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Each of these cards contains an obstacle or event that must be resolved by the active player when the card is tapped.&#10;&#10;Most of the obstacles are resolved by playing the potion card that matches the obstacle. When a player flip an obstacle card that he can't resolve, the rat takes a wound. On a second wound the rat will die and by out of the round.&#10;&#10;After resolving any door the player can end his turn and collect the rewards. He collect 1 yellow chit for each door card face up and 1 green chit for each door card face down. The yellow chit can be traded for cheese tokens and the green chit represent the rats being poisoned by the lab and will die if they take too much!&#10;&#10;",

Do you have what it takes to be a famous football player? Find out today with  Famous First Downs - the World's Smallest Gridiron Football Game!&#10;&#10;&#10;Famous First Downs is a fun, fast-playing simulation of the sport of American football. The game focuses on offensive and defensive play-calling and on the need to build and manage your team&rsquo;s momentum over multiple scoring drives. Each down, the offense declares a play to which the defense secretly responds. The offense then chooses a play option, resulting in the success or failure of the play and determining any subsequent yardage. Blocked plays earn momentum for the defense while first downs earn momentum for the offense. That momentum can then be spent on special plays like interceptions, extra yards, and repeated downs. The various coins are used to track downs, momentum, and yardage. Famous First Downs is the fourth game in the Famous Games Company's line of World&#226;&#128;&#153;s Smallest Sports Games and a personal favourite of the company's founder.&#10;&#10;",

The rules cover areas such as U.S. air strikes, Medevac evacuation by helicopter of U.S. casualties, 'body count' victory points, NLF ambushes and booby traps. It was first printed as a magazine game in Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #26.&#10;&#10;SPI said: &quot;This game is unique in many ways. It uses a combat system in which the defensive value of a unit depends on the terrain the defender is in ... The game provides for true hidden movement for one player (the guerillas.) A wide selection of scenarios and Orders of Battle are provided.&quot;&#10;&#10;In 1975 SPI released John Young's design Search &amp; Destroy, a heavily revised version of the Grunt game system. Search &amp; Destroy successfully fleshed out the concepts introduced in Grunt, and benefitted from the increases in design and graphics that SPI saw from the early to mid seventies.&#10;&#10;",

The first three clues must begin with a different letter in the science term other than the first letter. If neither team figures out the science term, the lead scientist gives a final clue that begins with the first letter of the term. After each clue, teams have one minute to both submit a guess and place a bet based upon how confident they are in their guess. Each team that correctly guesses the science term scores points based on their bet, and the team with the most points at the end of the game wins!&#10;&#10;",
