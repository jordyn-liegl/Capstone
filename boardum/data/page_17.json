    "description": "With MicroMacro: Crime City &ndash; All In, the next district of the crime-ridden black-and-white metropolis Crime City now opens up for the players. On a new, huge city map, which seamlessly follows the previous plans, 16 tricky crime cases are again waiting to be solved by one to four amateur detectives. These are brand new stories, more sophisticated and criminal than ever before! The aim is to determine motives, find evidence and convict the perpetrators. An attentive eye is just as much in demand as creative powers of deduction to unravel everything on the 75 x 110 cm game board. As a little help, a magnifying glass is included in the game and the individual cases are again marked with symbols, so that parents can decide which cases even the youngest investigators may investigate and uncover. MicroMacro: Crime City 3 - All In can be played completely independently, no previous knowledge from the other two parts is required.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Expedition to Newdale is the new Oh My Goods! (2015) card game from renowned designer Alexander Pfister. In this board game adaption of the successful card game, 1 to 4 players from 12 and up compete in different chapters to experience the world of the Longsdale kingdom once again. The story of Expedition to Newdale starts about five years after the events from Oh my Goods! Escape to Canyon Brook, but you don&rsquo;t need to know the prequels at all. Each chapter of the game lasts about 90 minutes which adds up to around 12 hours of exciting campaign gameplay. And when you found your favorite chapter while playing the campaign, you can always come back and play it again to have even more fun!&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game you have your personal board, a coal mine as your start building and 5 hand cards. Depending on which chapter you are playing, the appropriate game board sits in the middle of the table. Each round is divided into 5 phases which are played in order (or partially parallel, once you become more familiar with the game). In phase 1, a new event is revealed which usually alters the course of play in this round slightly (e. g., by introducing new buildings). Additionally the event card shows a fixed amount of workers which are available this round. An information which is much appreciated, as you have to place your action markers in phase 2. The latter are numbered 1 &mdash; 4 which is important for phase 4 and means that you need to plan ahead. But first phase 3: in this phase, more workers are drawn from a bag and get added to the others. This means that productions which would have been impossible before (because workers were missing) are now easily done. Pushing your luck might be beneficial! Phase 4 is the opposite to phase 2. Instead of placing your workers, you resolve their chosen action in order of their numbers. We hope you had a backup plan in place if your desired workers were not drawn in phase 3, because this can trigger an unpleasant chain of events! Not enough workers could mean that a production does not happen, which then means that you might not have enough money to build the building with your second action marker. Oh, and your third marker was planned to directly produce in the newly built building? Well, where there is no building, there&rsquo;s no place to produce in, right? Clearly: planning ahead, a little luck and good alternatives are the way to success. In Phase 5, all players can either use a free building action or draw new hand cards. The last phase is used to resolve all buildings which do not need workers, e. g., an automatic coal production or a building which offers the conversion of a certain good to victory points. Afterwards the next round starts, of which you play a total of seven. A final scoring at the end of round seven will then show if you win or lose.&#10;&#10;",

During this journey, you will study animals, carry out cartographic surveys, publish your findings, and develop theories. Starting with the naturalist controlling the Darwin token, naturalists take turns in clockwise order, performing these two steps in order:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Study an animal or take inspiration from a character: Choose one of the three tiles facing the Beagle and place it onto your naturalist's notebook.

Gain the bonuses depicted or any additional scoring bonuses triggered by the tile's placement.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Voyage of the Beagle: After placing a tile on your notebook, move the Beagle as many spaces forward as the distance between the Beagle and the tile you just selected (1-3 spaces), then draw a new tile to replace the empty space on the journey board.&#10;&#10;&#10;Your goal is to score more points than your opponents to determine who contributed the most to On the Origin of Species.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

A liberally-illustrated rulebook teaches gamers ASL using a conversational style to teach the concepts of ASL. If you own and play ASL Starter Kit #1 you will be pleasantly surprised to find how easy it is to spot the new rules ASLSK#2 adds - we've highlighted the new rules so that you can skip rereading what you've learned in ASLSK#1 and get right to the new rules!&#10;&#10;What does ASLSK#2 add? GUNS! Artillery pieces. Anti-tank guns. The famous and deadly German &quot;88&quot;. Mortars and bazookas! ASLSK#2 adds the &quot;to hit&quot; procedure to the foundation you learned in ASLSK#1. And if you didn't get ASLSK#1? There are two &quot;infantry only&quot; scenarios to get you up to speed!&#10;&#10;This answers the inevitable question we get with the Starter Kit concept. Do I need ASLSK#2 if I have ASLSK#1? The Starter Kits are self contained. Each has everything you need to play what's in the box, with the higher numbers adding to the ASL knowledge you'll have from playing previous Starter Kits. We do not anticipate changing what you've learned from prior Starter Kits (for example, ASLSK#2 adds about 4 pages of rules to the base built by ASLSK#1). A better question would be &quot;Do I need ASLSK#1 if I buy ASLSK#2?&quot;. The short answer is a resounding no! You can dive right in with ASLSK#2. But if you do, and you like the game, ASLSK#1 adds more boards and scenarios (infantry only) for you to enjoy.

    "description": "Antike II is a challenging strategy game about evolution and competition among ancient civilizations. Ancient nations create cities, build temples, sail the seas, and discover new principles of science and technology. Their legions and galleys open new settlements and defend their people against attacks from their enemies. Two scenarios can be chosen as the game board is two-sided.&#10;&#10;Every nation tries to win ancient kings, scholars, generals, citizens, and navigators for themselves. The nation that acquires a specified number (depending on the number of players) of ancient personalities first wins the game!&#10;&#10;Lead one of these nations to victory&mdash;but watch out for your enemies as they will want to conquer your cities to destroy your temples. The game depends not on the luck of dice or cards, but on thoughtful plans and skillful diplomacy.&#10;&#10;Antike II differs from the 2005 Antike in several ways, according to designer Mac Gerdts. To start, players now own city tokens, which allows them some degree of choice as to which resource a newly founded city shall produce. Military units have become more expensive, and the rules for the conquest of cities are considerably easier. The scientific progresses were altered as well. Neutral temples now exist, which may be destroyed, gaining VPs of a general, without harming other players. The game features two new maps in a new graphical design, and a new card named &quot;BELLONA&quot; (the ancient Roman goddess of war) has been introduced to counter the starting player's advantage.&#10;&#10;Gerdts notes that the main goal of all of these changes was to make the rules for a conquest of cities easier, while also opening more possibilities to win the game without the need to attack other players.&#10;&#10;",

There are seven different rail companies that players can expand.  Each time you extend a rail, the other stockholders can veto your action, but it might cost them their shares.  When two companies' rail touch, the railways merge to become one.  The game is over when only one company remains or there are no rail tiles remaining, and the winner is the player who earned the most money over the course of the game.&#10;&#10;",

Axis &amp; Allies Pacific 1940, designed and developed by Larry Harris, utilizes the updated rules established in A&amp;A Anniversary Edition. Two new combat units debut in this game, Tactical Bombers and Mechanized Infantry. Australia and New Zealand, joined together as the ANZAC forces, represent a new playable ally. China fields more forces than ever before, but will need help from their allies -- the United States and England -- to withstand the might of expansionist Imperial Japan.&#10;&#10;Axis &amp; Allies Pacific 1940 features an oversized board that measures 35 inches wide by 32 inches high (89 x 81 cm). With over 450 pieces, deluxe game components and local storage boxes, this game raises the standard established by A&amp;A Anniversary Edition. All new rules for neutral nations, naval &amp; air bases, kamikaze attacks and convoy disruption add even more depth and historical accuracy to this giant game.&#10;&#10;Finally, this deluxe theater-level game is designed to join together with Axis & Allies: Europe 1940 to create the greatest Axis &amp; Allies experience to date! When joined, these boards will measure 5 feet wide by 32 inches high (178 x 81 cm). Both games have been designed to play alone or together to offer a 2-6 player global 1940 scenario, complete with separate set up and national objectives.&#10;&#10;Integrates with:&#10;&#10;    Axis & Allies: Europe 1940&#10;&#10;&#10;",

It&rsquo;s time to let the guns talk and soon everyone is aiming at everyone. The richest surviving gangster wins the game!&#10;&#10;Ca$h 'n Gun$ will make you relive the best scenes of your favorite gangster movies. Fun, bluffing, and tough negotiations are guaranteed, but will you dare to play? It's simply killing!&#10;&#10;On each turn, a player will assume the role of &quot;The Don&quot;, and will call out the steps in gameplay.&#10;&#10;Before the skirmish itself, an available pot of cash will be laid out before the players. This pot must be evenly split up amongst all of the surviving hoods.&#10;&#10;After that, the &quot;Don&quot; of the round will ask the players, including himself, to load their guns (in the form of selecting one of three possible cards: &quot;Bang!&quot;, &quot;Bang! Bang! Bang!&quot; or &quot;Click! Click!&quot; from a set of 8 cards: 2 &quot;Bang!&quot;s, 1 Triple-&quot;Bang!&quot; and 5 &quot;Clicks!&quot;), and then count down to all of the players aiming their guns (real foam guns).&#10;&#10;Each player will then take a look at how many guns are pointed at them, and also take a look at the available pot of cash for the round before deciding if they want to &quot;Chicken Out&quot; and remove themselves from the skirmish. If they choose to back down, they will get a &quot;Chicken&quot; token which will deduct from their ill-gotten gains at the end of the game.&#10;But all players have to &quot;Chicken Out&quot; at the same time, using a countdown like the aiming.&#10;&#10;The remaining players will resolve the shootout showing their cards. First, all Triple-&quot;Bangs!&quot; wound the players they are aimed at. If there are still-aiming players with &quot;Bang!&quot; cards, those now wound their targets. &quot;Click!&quot;s are only bluffs and do nothing. A player that is wounded during the standoff does not participate in the split of the cash and receives a bandage (any player that receives a certain number of bandages is eliminated from the game). Now all the used cards are discarded--even those of the players that &quot;Chickened Out&quot;.&#10;&#10;Now the remaining players will finally split the cash. If the cash cannot be divided evenly, the rest is kept on the table and is added to the new pot.&#10;&#10;The game is played 8 rounds, until all cards were played. Keeping track of the cards is important, since all players have only a limited supply of &quot;real&quot; shots.&#10;&#10;There are a couple of expansions packed-in with most editions that change some of the mechanics of the game, and also add a new &quot;traitor&quot;-based mechanic, as well.&#10;&#10;",

On Saturday nights, the factory comes to life as the ultimate race course with treacherous obstacles and rival sabotage. In Robo Rally, players move their robots through the course by speeding through corridors and dodging traps to reach each checkpoint first. Only the strongest robots survive!&#10;&#10;Enter the world of mad machines and dangerous schemes in the Robo Rally board game. Players control their robot with game cards which reveal directions on how the robots can move through the hectic Robo Rally automobile factory. Use strategy to outsmart rival robots while racing towards each checkpoint in your chosen course in numerical order. Beware of factory obstacles such as industrial lasers, gaping pits, and moving conveyer belts that can make or break the race.&#10;&#10;The 2016 edition of Robo Rally differs from earlier versions in a number of ways:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Players each now have their own deck of twenty cards, with the same cards in each deck. On a turn, a player draws nine cards from their deck, programs five of the cards, then discards the rest. Two cards says &quot;Again&quot; and repeat the action programmed in the previous slot; one card says &quot;Energy&quot; and gives a energy cube which you can use to buy options.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Since each player has their own deck, the cards no longer have priority numbers to determine who moves first. Now movement order is determined by whoever is closest to a transmitter on the game board.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    When players are damaged, they no longer receive one less card for each damage (or have one of their program registers locked) at the start of a round; instead they receive damage cards that will be shuffled into their decks. &quot;Normal&quot; damage from the board or a robot laser gives you &quot;spam&quot; damage. When you program one of these cards, you remove it from play at the appropriate time and replace it in the register with the top card from your deck. Surprise! Other types of damage exist, with a Trojan horse granting you two spam, a virus infecting nearby players, and a worm forcing you to reboot, which gives you even more damage. By playing the damage, though, you remove it from your deck.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

After each performance, your little troupe accumulates fame and may one day pique the interest of P.T. Barnum, the greatest circus mogul of all time.&#10;&#10;In 3 Ring Circus, players take on the role of a circus director who tours the United States at the end of the 19th century. Your objective is to hire artists and offer performances in various towns and cities with the intention of gaining fame. In towns, features are easy to set up and give you starting resources to upgrade your cast; small cities are somewhat more demanding, but they allow you to come into contact with better artists; audiences in big cities are even more demanding and want to see very specific numbers, but performing there brings you much more fame!&#10;&#10;On their turn, players can hire an artist or host a performance. At the beginning of the game, each player's circuses are empty, so it will be necessary to contract to form the company. The artist cards grant more or fewer benefits depending on the order in which they act, so one of the keys to the game is planning the shows that will be offered.&#10;&#10;If they decide to act, the players must move to a free space on the map. If it is a town, they receive the most basic currency cards as a prize. If you perform in a small city, depending on the number of pedestals you have in your company you can claim more or fewer entry cards (the second most valuable) or fame points. In the big cities, you get a lot of fame points, but the public always demands a specific type of artist.&#10;&#10;While your little circus tries to survive, the great and splendid Barnum Circus travels across the country, and when it arrives in a big city, a score is held in that region, and the circuses that have given the most performances there will gain even more fame.&#10;&#10;-description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Will a leader rise up and rally the support of the people, or will the shadow of anarchy spread over the land?&#10;&#10;In Warrior Knights, each player takes on the role of a Baron vying for control of the Kingdom. Each Baron commands four faithful Nobles who lead his armies into battle. Each Baron seeks to capture cities in order to gain Influence (victory points), which is used to measure his claim to the throne. Barons may also seek to gain advantage by increasing their income, gathering Votes to use at the Assembly, or by amassing Faith, which can be used to gain a measure of control over chance events. Only through cunning strategy and careful diplomacy can a Baron hope to attain victory.&#10;&#10;Warrior Knights has a very clever mechanism.  Each player has a selection of tasks they can accomplish each turn, such as move &amp; attack, gain political strength, hire mercenaries, and gain religious faith.  Only 6 of these are done in any turn.  Each player selects 2 tasks for each 1/3 of the game turn.  The cards of all the players are then shuffled together, so the players know only the two tasks they will perform in each 1/3 of the game turn, but not the order they will be played.&#10;&#10;In addition, the game has four special phases that are triggered based on how frequently players are choosing a particular task.  Collecting taxes individually, once done often enough, will trigger a taxation phase.  Players collecting political power trigger a session of Parliament.  When enough players want to hire mercenaries there is an auction for their services.  The flip side is that the more mercenaries that are hired the more often they want to be paid in the wages phase.&#10;&#10;The mixing of these two clever mechanisms, choosing tasks but performing them in a random order and triggering the 4 special phases at somewhat unpredictable times makes for a tense game.   Players can often be caught short of cash if wages are demanded more frequently than taxes are collected.  If the other players all collect political influence a Parliament might be called when one or two players have only a single vote.  These elements of variable turn orders and variable phases give the game a highly addictive quality.&#10;&#10;",

Each turn a card is revealed that displays 3 actions that players can choose from. Each player in turn choose an action by playing a 1, 2 or 3 card identifying the first, second or third action on the revealed card. The beauty of this mechanism lies in the distribution of 3 actions among 4 players. Someone always misses out.&#10;&#10;If two players choose the same action (and this is often, decided by the last player as the first 3 often - not always - but often  choose actions a1, 2 and 3) the players who chose it negotiate a solution. If they cannot come to an agreement they duel.&#10;&#10;This is one of the defining elements of the game, but can take some time (negotiations can) and so was dropped from the re-implementation as Domaine.&#10;&#10;The game board is built of 6 tiles randomly placed in a frame producing a slightly different game each time. It is seen by many as the third in a Teuber thematic trilogy defined by Entdecker, CATAN, L&#195;&#182;wenherz.&#10;&#10;The board is conflicted and in the manner of Go the idea is to capture as much territory as possible.  Each player starts with three castles (12 across all four players, and a crowded board). They build walls to create kingdoms, and train knights to defend them, both key actions on that action card they bid on each turn.&#10;&#10;Consequently this is a high conflict area grabbing game with a heavy element of negotiation.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Vampire: the Eternal Struggle (or VTES for short) is a multi-player collectable card game based on the award-winning Vampire: the Masquerade role playing game in which players take on the role of ancient vampires known as a Methuselahs. Considered mere legend by many, Methuselahs rule everything from the shadows, engaging in a eons-long Machiavellian conflict that encompasses political, social, and even physical warfare. The struggle is won or lost based on the actions taken by your minions &ndash; younger vampires who unknowingly do your bidding. In this way, the game can allow for deep and immersive storytelling as your minions purchase equipment, hire retainers, even suggest legislative changes to vampiric society, all in the service of your dark plots.&#10;&#10;VTES was the second card game designed by Richard Garfield (designer of Magic the Gathering, Netrunner, and other games). It was designed to avoid some of the flaws that Garfield found in Magic: VTES does not require you to include resource or mana cards in your deck, and cards are instantly replaced when played, meaning that card draw isn&rsquo;t as important as knowing when to discard a card to sculpt a better hand. It also has a gameplay experience more in keeping with a boardgame than a traditional card game &ndash; VTES is usually played by 4 or 5 players and games can last up to 2 hours.&#10;&#10;Unlike most multi-player games, players in VTES do not engage in a free-for-all. Each player directs their attacks to the player on their left (their &ldquo;prey&rdquo;) and defends against the player on their right (their &ldquo;predator&rdquo;). You gain victory points by eliminating or &ldquo;ousting&rdquo; your prey from the game, in which case the next player to the left becomes your new prey. The player with the most victory points at the end of the game wins (even if they have been ousted!). This arrangement makes the game a very social one &ndash; you and the player two seats to the left and right have common enemies. But if you help these allies too much, you may find that you&rsquo;ve made one of them too strong, and when they suddenly become your new predator, your help has transformed that ally into a deadly threat.&#10;&#10;VTES is also a resource management game. Each player begins with 30 points of influence called &ldquo;pool&rdquo; that Methuselahs hold dearer than unlife itself. If you run out of pool, you are ousted from the game. But this pool is also the way that you sway vampires to your cause. Each turn you have the opportunity to spend your pool to seduce a vampire. Weak fledgling vampire are easily swayed, but the older more powerful ones require convincing, which may require multiple turns to accomplish. Once a vampire is converted to your side, all the pool you spent on them becomes blood possessed by this vampire, which can be spent to play cards that allow them to activate their unique vampiric powers. Each minion must manage their blood and you must manage your pool &ndash; spending more provides you with additional minions, but brings you one step closer to being ousted. Under- or over- investing in your minions may well cost you the game.&#10;&#10;Vampire: The Eternal Struggle has risen once again from torpor! White Wolf has granted Black Chantry Productions license to print new cards! Details are still forthcoming as to what to expect. Go to http://www.blackchantry.com for the latest details. The game is also supported by Vampire: Elder Kindred Network&trade;, the official player organization responsible for sanctioning and regulating VTES tournaments, recording V:TES players&rsquo; ratings (and rankings), as well as designing and releasing new digital expansions featuring profession artwork.  Go to their site at www.vekn.net to check out what's new with the game!&#10;&#10;",

Players take opposing sides: one has to defend the stronghold, and the other has to break into the castle as soon as possible.

A desperate fight takes place every single turn. The invaders build war machines, equip their soldiers, train them, and use black magic rituals to achieve victory. Meanwhile, defenders repair walls, build cannons, train soldiers, and do everything they can to hold the castle as long as possible.&#10;&#10;If the invader manages to break into the castle before the end of seven rounds, they win; otherwise the defender wins.&#10;&#10;This second edition of Stronghold features:&#10;&#10;&bull; Ten objective cards for the invader and ten hidden defense plan cards for the defender; each objective encourages the invader to consider a particular move, while each defense plan shows the defender different ways to surprise the invader&#10;&bull; Shorter gameplay than the first edition, with attackers being placed on the board during set-up&#10;&bull; Gameplay limited to two players only, replacing the team rules in the first edition&#10;&bull; Streamlined rules and an enhanced rulebook&#10;&bull; Improved components, such as a larger game board and new artwork&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Blue Moon is a card game for two players, which has often been compared to Magic: The Gathering, although it has considerably different game mechanics. Particularly, it is not a CCG: There are no random cards in any expansion. It can thus be regarded as the first LCG, although it doesn't use that term yet.&#10;&#10;It is set in the fictional world of Blue Moon, where different peoples fight for dominance of the world and the favor of the Dragons.&#10;Each people has its own unique traits and gameplay mechanics, and is represented by a 30 card deck.&#10;&#10;The standard game box contains the 'Vulca' and the 'Hoax' decks, a small gameboard and three small plastic dragon miniatures, used as scoring counters in the game.&#10;&#10;Other decks can be bought separately as expansions with 31 or 30 cards each.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Rules overview from the official rules:The game consists of independent consecutive fights. The starting player begins the first fight.&#10;&#10;Each fight is contested in one of two elements, either fire or earth, as announced by the starting player of the fight. During each fight, players take alternate turns to play their cards building up power in their combat and support areas. Basically, each turn the players play a character card and possibly some additional cards to at least match the total power of their opponent, who must then in turn match his opponent&rsquo;s power, and so on. &ndash; If a player is unable to do this, he must retreat from the fight.&#10;&#10;A fight ends when one of the players retreats. The other player is the winner of the fight and attracts a number of dragons. Both players remove all their cards from their combat and support areas and place them onto their face up discard pile. The retreating player then starts the next fight.&#10;&#10;Usually, the game ends when one player runs out of cards and retreats from the last fight. Then the player with dragons on his side is the victor and scores some victory points (crystals). A player wins the game instantly if he has all three dragons on his side and then attracts further dragons.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Description from the publisher.The world of Blue Moon is in chaos. Its god has abandoned it, and its people are in open war against each other, while the ruling power of three elemental dragons reigns above all! In this original 2-player game designed by Reiner Knizia, each player takes control over one of the Blue Moon peoples - the creative machinations of the Mimix, the fiery Vulca, the lofty Flit, and the clever Hoax - in their quest for dominance. The Blue Moon Legends basic set provides all the material needed to play, including details on the various peoples, a game board, full-color rules, and three plastic dragon figures. Expansion packs contain additional people cards.&#10;&#10;Blue Moon is part of the Kosmos two-player series.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Avast ye pirates! Gather your crews and set sail for adventure on the high seas in Rum &amp; Bones: Second Tide!&#10;&#10;Based on online MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena) style games, Rum &amp; Bones has 2-6 players taking control of legendary pirate heroes, each with unique powers and abilities, as their crews fight over Davy Jones' legendary treasure!&#10;&#10;Players each control up to five heroes at any time, moving them across the game board in an attempt to destroy various key features on their opponents' ship. Victory is obtained by destroying enough of these features. Your heroes are not alone, however, as your crew also consists of deckhands and bosuns who, while not controlled by the player, will work on a simple AI to wreak havoc on the enemy!&#10;&#10;Of course, what would pirates be without plunder? And in Rum &amp; Bones the most sought after treasure are Davy Jones' mythical pieces of eight! Players amass these powerful coins during gameplay to unleash devastating abilities and attacks from their Heroes, crushing all enemies before them until only they remain!&#10;&#10;This game is both a stand-alone and compatible as an expansion to Rum &amp; Bones. In Rum &amp; Bones: Second Tide, 2 to 6 players will take control of one of two deadly pirate crews: The mysterious and monstrous Deep Lords, who seek to claim Davy Jones&rsquo; treasure in an effort to flood the world and reshape it to their liking, or the Marea de la Muerte&cedil; a crew of ruthless gold-seeking Spanish cutthroats who will stop at nothing to claim the treasure for their own greed!&#10;&#10;Players control teams of three to five heroes, depending on the number of players, each with various and unique powers and abilities. These Heroes are drawn from five different classes, each with their own strengths and weaknesses:&#10;&#10;     Captains: Jack-of-all-Trade Heroes who specialize in buffing other Heroes.&#10;     Brutes: The toughest of the tough, Brutes can take a ton of punishment and only get stronger for doing so!&#10;     Gunner: Ranged damage dealers, Gunners have the lowest HP of all classes, but can also dish out the most hurt.&#10;     Swashbucklers: Like Gunners, Swashbucklers specialize in dealing damage, but prefer the up-close-and-personal approach.&#10;     Quartermaster: While they don't deal the most damage, Quartermasters make up for it in raw utility: specializing in healing and buffing Heroes, and also enhancing your Deckhands and Bosuns!&#10;&#10;&#10;The most notable change to gameplay is their new &quot;dynamic Leveling System&quot;. Now each Hero begins the game with their Basic Attack skill card. As they gain Coins, which are obtained from KO'ing enemies and Objectives, they can use those Coins to buy new skills, as well as level up existing skills! Also, they've introduced a new &quot;Alternating Activation&quot; method of play where players will take turns activating 1 Hero (or their Crew), and then their opponent will do the same, continuing back and forth until everyone has gone.&#10;&#10;",

With each ship lacking fuel to get home, each player must collect basic elements from surrounding asteroids, using the gravity of the dimension and what little resources they have in order to reach the warp gate that will take them home. But in this dimension, moving ships will travel towards the nearest object, which is usually another ship, and when those objects are moving either forward or backward, reaching the warp gate isn't always easy. Time is running out to save your crew and your ship! As a grim reminder of the cost of failing to escape, the frozen hulks of dead spacecraft litter the escape route &mdash; but with careful card play, you can slingshot past these derelict craft and be the first to escape from the Gravwell!&#10;&#10;Gravwell uses 26 alphabetized cards to determine movement order and thrust; most cards move your ship towards the nearest object, but a few move you away from it. At the start of each round, players draft fuel cards, picking up three pairs of two cards, with only the top card of each pile being visible; you get some information as to which moves you can expect from the other spaceships, but you won't know which moves you'll be forced to make when you draft your cards!&#10;&#10;During a round, each player will play all of their fuel cards in the order of their choosing. During each phase of a round, each player chooses one card, then all cards are revealed and resolved in alphabetical order. When your opponents move in ways you didn't expect, you won't always be heading in the direction you thought you would! Each player holds an &quot;Emergency Stop&quot; card that they may tactically play only once per round to avoid such a situation.&#10;&#10;Whoever first reaches the warp gate wins, but if no one has escaped after six rounds, then the player who is closest to the gate wins.&#10;&#10;",

Each player has a hand of cards, and on a turn, you'll add 1-3 cards to the front of your hand (without changing their order), move one card in your hand closer to the front, then discard as many cards from the back of your hand as the number of cards that you added. When the sunset card comes out, you can take no more pictures, and everyone scores for what's on their camera.&#10;&#10;The cards all have numbers and colors on them, and you try to line them up in hand to score the most points possible.&#10;&#10;",

You can share spaces with other goats on the way up, but there is only room for one goat at the top of each mountain. If someone else's goat moves to the mountain top, they will kick you off and you'll have to start your trek over.&#10;&#10;It's a game about timing.

It is just a normal part of the cycle of the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;&#10;In Level X, each player has six playing pieces that they try to place at the end of the movement tracks on the game board in order to score victory points (VPs). The tracks are labeled 5-10, and they are 2-4 spaces long.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you roll four six-sided dice, then place them into groups of 1-4 dice with each group ideally totaling from 5 to 10. If you make such a group, you can either place one of your playing pieces on the first space of the track matching that number or advance your playing piece on that track until you reach the final space: the X. Whenever you first land on an X, you take a VP token worth a number of points equal to that track's number. If you are already on an X and roll that number again, you take another token. Only one playing piece can be on an X; if someone else lands on an X that you occupy, you remove your playing piece from the board and can start down that track again later.&#10;&#10;If you collect one token of each value (5-10), you take a bonus card, with the first being worth 15 VPs and the others worth 12, 9 and 6. When all the bonus cards have been claimed or three of the VP token stacks are empty, the game ends.

Each player plays with 2 double-sided hex tiles containing a mix of land and sea shapes. They take turns placing a tile each to make a map together. Land places tiles trying to complete land areas, and Sea places tiles trying to complete sea areas. Completed areas score a point per tile; land areas for Land, sea areas for Sea. Some tiles score bonus points for whoever completes the area they are in. So players may decide to strategically complete rival&rsquo;s areas to gain their bonus points. Other tiles allow players to play their second tile, or steal a player&rsquo;s tile - but not their last one!&#10;&#10;Using 2 double-sided tiles (one side always revealed and the other always hidden until played) means there is partial information to plan around, and some surprises too. Players replenish back up to 2 tiles from a choice of 2 face-up tile stacks.&#10;&#10;The strategy of the game involves careful tile placement to score from as many land or sea areas as possible, while minimising your rivals&rsquo; opportunities to score from the tiles you play. Watch your rivals&rsquo; possible plays, and control tempo strategically with Play Again and Steal tiles. Look out for opportunities to score valuable bonus points in your and your rivals&rsquo; areas. Carefully select tiles as you replenish your hand to prepare for your next turn.&#10;&#10;The game ends once the last tile is placed. The player or team with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;The basic Land vs Sea game is simple enough for light / family gamers. After you have played the basic game, you can unlock more scoring options on the tiles to add surprising depth:&#10;1. Mountain &amp; Coral scoring - score for cumulative chains of connected Mountain (Land) / Coral (Sea) sections.&#10;2. Caravan &amp; Ship scoring - score for Caravans &amp; Ships added to Trade Routes on the map, and score each Trade Route you have majority in (more Caravans scores the Trade Route for Land, more Ships for Sea) at the end of the game.  &#10;3. Waypoints - bonus points you can place on the map to entice cooperation, or score for yourself.&#10;&#10;2, 3 &amp; 4 player modes:&#10;You can play head to head with 2 players, or with 4 players in teams using the basic rules and any of the additional scoring options. 4 player games use Waypoints to prevent alpha players directly instructing their partner.&#10;&#10;The challenging 3 player mode uses all of the additional scoring options in a more asymmetric game. The Cartographer scores by connecting Mountain and Coral sections, and all players compete for bonus points and Trade Route scoring.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

But there&rsquo;s a trick: one cannot activate all their cards at once, which means that tough choices will have to be made each turn in order to select the cards that are the most needed.&#10;&#10;The resources gathered from the activated city cards will allow the players to acquire cards from a common pool, allowing them to get improved buildings, technologies, wonders, etc. and therefore to leverage their civilization deck to new heights through more and more efficient card combos. As the common pool of cards progresses (either as players have acquired cards or because they didn't - which leads to one card from the pool to be discarded per turn), the game progresses through eras. Medieval cards are better than classical cards, and industrial cards are even better, but of course those cards are more and more expensive to acquire.&#10;&#10;A modular board, at the center of the table, holds each civilization's army. The board is made of Provinces to be conquered. Unoccupied Province's inhabitants are barbarians who will provide resources to the player who defeats them.

With war on the horizon and whisperings of a prophetic storm approaching, now is the time to gather all your strength and set out to forge your place in Terrinoth's book of legends!&#10;&#10;Rune Age is a deck-building game of adventure and conquest for 1-4 players. (The box says 2-4 players, but 2 of the 4 scenarios include solitaire rules.)&#10;&#10;Set in the fantasy realm of Terrinoth (Runebound, Descent: Journeys in the Dark, Runewars, and DungeonQuest), Rune Age puts players in control of one of four races, vying for dominance in a world embroiled in conflict.&#10;&#10;Designed by Corey Konieczka, Rune Age is a unique deck-building game that centers around scenarios. The four different scenarios included in Rune Age present alternate win conditions for players, from an all-out war to determine the victor to a cooperative game experience where players all win or lose together. Scenarios not only dictate the win conditions, they also determine which card types will populate Terrinoth (forming the central card pools) and which Event cards will form the Event deck. The Event deck contains thematic challenges, enemies, and happenings that are tied to the chosen scenario, creating a new play environment each turn.&#10;&#10;Gameplay in Rune Age centers around players working to develop their individual deck of cards. At the beginning of the game, each player begins with a small assortment of cards in their deck, drawing five cards each turn to carry out their actions. Each player's deck represents their faction's military strength and capabilities. These decks will be formed with their faction-specific Unit cards and a central collection of Neutral Unit cards, Tactics cards, and Gold cards.&#10;&#10;While players begin with limited cards in their deck, through cunning and strategic use of their available cards, players can expand their deck to create a destructive force of their own clever design. Will you create brutal deck of formidable Units? Or will you rely on Gold and Influence to acquire neutral forces and powerful Tactics?&#10;&#10;",

The Havel River was difficult to navigate near the Oranienburg mills, so a canal was built from the Havel that crossed the older Ruppin canal, thereby forming the Oranienburg canal cross. During the industrialization in the 19th century, lots of companies and businesses were formed at this important waterway. Moreover, additional streets and railways were built.&#10;&#10;In Oranienburger Kanal, you erect new industries and shape the infrastructure by building pathways, streets, railways, and canals. Most important of all are bridges that connect buildings. To do all of this, you have access to various actions that you select in the right moments.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, the player with the best industrial area and the best infrastructure wins.&#10;&#10;Oranienburger Kanal also includes a solo game!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Analyze the characteristics of every era you are facing, make the best choice for your kingdom development, and become several famous civilizations in our fascinating history. By going through the rise and fall of empires, a unique civilization of yours will finally arise!&#10;&#10;Age of Civilization is a pocket-sized civilization game. Throughout one game, each player leads up to three historical civilizations to form a unique combination of abilities. Players build Wonders, research technology, develop culture, conquer for glory, or even exploit their people. Only the player who wisely manages his workers and wealth can achieve the greatest civilization.&#10;&#10;Game-play overview&#10;&#10;The game is played with 6 rounds. In the 1st round, each player picks one civilization card in the market and gains a number of worker tokens according to the population value indicated on the civilization card. Players may assign workers to action slots in the public region. There are usually 5-6 actions for each player to choose and these actions change between rounds. By assigning workers, players carry out the actions' effects such as earning coins or paying coins for technologies, wonders, or victory points, etc. At the end of a player's turn, workers may return to the player or disappear according to the kind of action it was working on.&#10;&#10;In subsequent rounds, players MAY pick another civilization card to replace their previous one. In that case, you reset the number of your workers to the population value indicated on the new civilization card and you lose the main ability of your previous civilization, but the legacy abilities of all your civilizations last forever. In each game, a player can only pick three civilization cards in total, so deciding when to raise a new civilization and which civilization combinations to pick is a big strategic decision of players. When the 6th round ends, the player with the most victory points is the winner.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "The Sun is dying&#10;&#10;In recent years, the Sun has become increasingly unstable, to the point where experts claim it could go supernova at any moment. The various inhabitants of the planets in this solar system are launching one last effort to save themselves, which involves building a final Ark to propel a small selection of their people into deep space. This requires a great deal of energy, and in a final ironic twist, the only source of such great energy is the dying star itself. In the process of extracting and transmitting the energy required to save themselves, they will be compounding the instability of the Sun and hastening the end of their worlds.&#10;&#10;Sol: Last Days of a Star is a board game for one to five players where each player represents a different planetary effort to transmit as much energy from the Sun back to their Ark so they can to escape the solar system before the Sun explodes!&#10;&#10;The board represents the solar environment: two layers of orbit around the Sun (Upper and Lower Orbit), and three layers within the Sun itself (the Convective, Radiative, and Core). The deeper you take actions, the higher your rewards, but the faster the instability of the Sun is increased. Your Mothership rotates slowly in orbit around the Sun, and this is the only place your ships can launch from to perform useful tasks in the solar environment. You can either convert ships into stations or use the ships to activate yours and other players' stations. If you activate your own stations you get the full reward, while activating other player's stations you split the reward with the owner. You gain energy by activating Energy Nodes, and you use this energy to either activate Ship Foundries to build new ships (which you need since you are constantly losing ships by converting them into new stations) or activate Transmit Towers to transmit the energy back to your Ark to turn into Momentum (which is ultimately how your Ark will escape). But you cannot enter the Sun without converting ships into Solar Gates which span the high energy membranes separating one layer of the sun from the next.&#10;&#10;You must carefully manage your time and resources in order to transmit the most energy back to your Ark before the Sun is lost forever. With any luck, some small collection of your last planetary residents will escape the solar system before it is engulfed by the oncoming supernova!&#10;&#10;",

A player may pay a certain number of 'beans' to refuse a block and it gets passed to the next player.  When a player's structure falls, they are out of the game.  Last player standing wins.&#10;&#10;Description of Bandu (1992, Milton Bradley, 2-6 players):&#10;Bandu is based upon the game of Bausack. Each player is given a base block and a number of beans. During a turn, a player chooses a wood block from a common supply and either holds a Refuse or Use auction. All player bid with their beans and the winner/loser must place the piece on their tower. If your tower falls you are out of the game. The last tower standing wins.&#10;&#10;Description of Sac Noir (Rio Grande Games, 2-8 players):&#10;There are five variations on how to play. The goal in all of them is to build a tower. The bag contains very different wooden pieces (i.e. an ashlar, an egg, a ring, a fir tree etc.) as well as a sack of beans for the &quot;auction variation&quot; of the game. Depending on the variation you choose, either each player builds his own tower or all build one together. The &quot;auction variations&quot; are the most suspenseful and surprising. One might end up spending quite some beans to avoid building an especially difficult element. Gambling and bluffing abilities are needed just as much as a feeling for statics and construction skills. It's a game with almost endless building possibilities. It's a challenge for steady hands and shaky suspense for clever tacticians.&#10;&#10;",

Those cards are hidden in the deck and will trigger painful dilemmas when drawn...&#10;&#10;Basic Deck:&#10;&#10;     8 Door cards - two each of red, blue, green and brown&#10;     10 Nightmare cards&#10;     58 Labyrinth cards:&#10;         16 red chambers:     3 keys, 4 moons, 9 suns&#10;         15 blue chambers:    3 keys, 4 moons, 8 suns&#10;         14 green chambers:   3 keys, 4 moons, 7 suns&#10;         13 brown chambers:   3 keys, 4 moons, 6 suns&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;Three mini-expansions, all standalone and compatible with one another, are included with the basic game:&#10;&#10;&#10;    &quot;The Towers&quot; introduces a new type of card that allows more searching and deck manipulation, while also imposing an additional victory condition.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    &quot;Happy Dreams and Dark Premonitions&quot; adds evil time bombs that will impede your progress at predictable moments of your quest as well as helpful but unreliable allies.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    In &quot;The Book of Steps Lost and Found&quot;, you must find the eight Door cards in a randomly given order and may remove discarded cards from the game to cast powerful spells that will help you complete this difficult task.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The target player can play a &quot;MISSED!&quot; card to dodge the shot.  Other cards can provide temporary boosts while in play (for example, different guns to improve your firing range) and special one-time effects to help you or hinder your opponents (such as Beer to restore health, or Barrels to hide behind during a shootout). A horse is useful for keeping your distance from unruly neighbors, while the Winchester can hit a target at range 5.

    "description": "Eight-Minute Empire, by Ryan Laukat, is a quick game that implements the Civilization/Exploration theme using card-driven area control (by placing armies and cities in a small map) and set collection (by getting resources from the board and the cards). Players spread through the map in order to collect points at the end of the game by having majorities in regions and continents. All actions (such as land or sea movement, army production, or the founding of cities) are driven by cards that are face-up (six at a time) and available by increasing prices. Cards also contain resources, which also give points when the game ends if properly collected.&#10;&#10;Its first version was available as print-and-play, and a regular (Kickstarter funded) version was published in 2013. An expansion featuring a European map is available as an expansion (Eight-Minute Empire: Europe Expansion Board), and a stand-alone sequel has also been published (Eight-Minute Empire: Legends).&#10;&#10;From the publisher:&#10;Build an empire and conquer the land in around eight minutes!&#10;&#10;In Eight-Minute Empire, 2-5 players take turns selecting a card from six displayed.  The card gives a good, and also has an action that the player takes immediately.  Actions help players take over the map, but sets of goods are worth points at the end of the game, so players have to balance the two aspects.&#10;&#10;Eight-Minute Empire is the super-quick area control game with tough decisions.  It's easy to learn and perfect for when you only have a few minutes.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Originally published as Texas by db-Spiele.&#10;&#10;The battle between farmers and ranchers is fairly abstract. A single pawn travels on a square grid. Each player has a hand of cards face up. These each have a direction and a distance. The player can either draw a card and add it to his hand, or play a card. If he plays a card, then the pawn moves the appropriate distance to an empty square, and the player places one of his markers. Each player also has judge symbols that can each be used only once. The judge lets you move onto a previously placed opposition marker and reverse it. Players score points for each contiguous region equal to the square of the number of markers. If a player is not careful, such a move may be forced, as there is a maximum number of cards that a player may hold.&#10;&#10;Contains rules for playing with 4 (in two partnerships of two players).&#10;&#10;Later republished 1999 as Rosenk&ouml;nig by Kosmos, as part of the two-player game series. The republication also included a re-theming of the game. The setting changed from Texas to England, and the factions changed from farmers and ranchers to the factions of the Plantagenet family from the Wars of the Roses (1455-1485) - the Lancaster (red rose) and the York (white rose) factions in a similarly abstracted fashion.&#10;&#10;Rosenk&ouml;nig is part of the Kosmos two-player series.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Twenty years ago, the settlers started into the depths of the galaxy to discover unknown planets, the undiscovered universe lying before them. Maybe they'll find planets with good ore or carbon deposits &mdash; or perhaps only barren ice planets. They might encounter alien folks and start lucrative trading, with pirates and wormholes being a constant challenge for them.&#10;&#10;Catan: Starfarers is a new version of Starfarers of Catan, originally released in 1999, that contains completely revised graphics and game materials, revised rules, and (most importantly) a variable game board that brings even more variety to the exploration of space.&#10;&#10;Changes to the mechanics include&#10;&#10;-If you are lower in the points you get cards on your turn regardless of what you roll. Two random cards initially, then one, then none as your victory points go up. This is a nice touch. No matter how unlucky you are you still get something. Plus if a player rolls a seven, the person can take a card from any other player, but their opponents now draw a random card from the deck.&#10;&#10;- Market Trades: Since you have no roads you no longer need ports so, since you no longer have ports you can trade with the market for any resource on your turn; provided you have the right cards. Additionally the ratios aren't bad, Any resource for 3:1, i.e. three of one for one of any other type. Goods (a type of resource) trades for 2:1. This plus no road blocking allows you to trade for resources and keep playing.&#10;&#10;- There are NPC races that can give you benefits, some of which are +1 resources whenever you get a resource of the same type. But you have to get there early. Now there is a new dynamic to the game, going out into space becomes a strategy on its own.&#10;&#10;- Negotiated trades: Since the resources are more readily available there are less negotiated trades. They still exist and someone can still trade 1:1, 3:1, etc... but it is no longer a singularly driving force in the game. Unless you have a big move and you're missing that one card.&#10;&#10;- Resource (set collection) becomes part of your strategy without being limited to negotiation and luck of the die. I think this actually works better.&#10;&#10;Colonization: You colonize to claim planets in a system. This is the same as building towns in Catan. But how many can be in a system (hex) depends on player count. In a three player game you're only allowed two colonies per system. In a four player game each system only holds up to three players colonies.  If you got blocked out early from the closest systems, reach further into the stars to other systems. Who knows you might meet pirate and you'll have to fight, or traders, perhaps a race of Travelers who will open a worm hole to anywhere on the map.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Le Havre: The Inland Port is a two-player game in which both players compete to become the richest harbormaster. How they do so? Players acquire resources, construct buildings and, after twelve rounds, score the total value of their buildings and their money in cash.&#10;&#10;Each round, a set of new, predefined buildings is added to the market. Both players now take turns by either building one of these buildings or by using an existing building's effects. To construct a building, players have to pay a certain amount of money and/or resources from their warehouse. Most of these buildings, in turn, allow to change the amount of resources on a player's warehouse board in a specific way when used. This is crucial to the game as players are restricted on how to fill or empty their warehouse. They have to combine and optimize these steps to max out the capacity of their warehouses. Players can even use their opponent's buildings, but they have to pay them one Franc (=money) to do so. When a building is not used during a round, it steadily increases in worth as its effects can be used up to four times in subsequent rounds. But a building that is not used for too long has to be sold to the market for half its value! The game uses an Ora et Labora-like wheel to track this status of each building in play.&#10;&#10;Although Le Havre: The Inland Port shares gameplay elements with Ora et Labora and is linked in theme with Le Havre, it is a distinct game with its own mechanisms and gameplay.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "The year is 1667 and you are a pirate sailing the waters of the Caribbean. A Spanish Galleon floats nearby, and you&rsquo;ve talked your crewmates into working together to steal all of its treasure. What you haven&rsquo;t told your fellow pirates is that you have no intentions on sharing the treasure once you have it. Your crewmates have told you that they share your loyalty and that they&rsquo;ll help you maroon the greedy pirates on your ship to the rocky island of Tortuga. But you&rsquo;ve seen your friends&rsquo; loaded pistols and heard their whisperings of a mutiny. You know that nobody can be trusted.&#10;&#10;Tortuga is all about the interactions you have with the other players. In some cases, such as when you and your shipmates are attacking the Spanish Galleon, you need to rely on your enemies in order to succeed. In the very next turn, however, your shipmates might stab you in the back with a mutiny in order to keep all the treasure for themselves.&#10;&#10;Since nobody holds a &quot;hand&quot; of cards, this game is also about knowledge and communication regarding the community Event cards. Unless you are in desperation mode, it is not wise to reveal Event cards at random. Almost half of the Event cards can hurt your team drastically. It's often in your best interest to use an action to view the cards first, or to rely on the knowledge of a trusted ally. Knowing where harmful Event cards are located allows you to force an enemy to reveal those cards and suffer the consequences. The most successful players are the ones who are able to discern who is on their team and then share vital information with them at opportune moments.&#10;&#10;Vote cards also play a key role in the game. Each Vote card has three sections - one each for Attacks, Mutinies, and Brawls. Players must put themselves in the best position to use their Vote cards, since their hand of Vote cards may not always be ideal based on their pawn location. For example, sometimes it may be worth putting in Water, causing an attack to fail, in order to save a Crossbones card for when you want to Mutiny against your captain.&#10;&#10;For 2-9 Players. 20-40 minutes.

Players will use their cards to gather gems, forge them into Artifacts, then combine those into Rune Stones, which grants a special ability for the rest of the game.

    "description": "Meuterer is a role selection card game in which players take the roles of crewmembers aboard a merchant ship. Each round, each player reveals goods from their hands that they wish to sell. However, most ports deal in only one sort of good, and only the captain may decide where the ship goes. If a player chooses to become the mutineer, he/she will try to become captain in order to change the destination of the ship. Each player may also have an ally in the fight, and the side which played the most conflict points gets the final word on the ship's destination.&#10;&#10;The player with the most points at the end of the game is the winner. Every time a player sells more goods than the other players or reaches their destination, they score points. Allies to a mutiny also get points.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Of Japanese origins, Shogi is played on a 9 by 9 board, and the object is to capture the opponent's king. There are two main differences with Western chess. First, not only pawns but almost every piece can promote if it reaches the opponents three last rows. Second and most distinctive characteristic is that captured pieces become property of the capturing player and during his turn he can &quot;parachute&quot; or &quot;drop&quot; them back to the board instead of performing a normal move. Because of this feature, similar to Bughouse, the game can last longer than a Chess game, the board generally stays fairly crowded and there is no simplification going into the endgame. However, the endgame is typically more rapid with many possibilities for attack and ways to achieve a checkmate, which also makes draws/ties very rare.&#10;&#10;According to &quot;A World of Chess&quot; by Jean-Louis Cazaux &amp; Rick Knowlton (2017, ISBN 978-0-7864-9427-9), Bishop, Rook and Drunk Elephant were introduced to the 9x9 Shogi creating Sho Shogi, the immediate predecessor of Shogi, in the middle of the 15th century. Modern Shogi where created with the introduction of the drop rule and the removal of the Drunk Elephant piece in Sho Shogi. This happened between 1567 and 1587 (earliest recording of modern Shogi). The latter date is based upon a picture in the diary of the samurai Matsudaira Ietada, dated 1587, which shows a game identical to the one of today.&#10;&#10;",

Your goal is to stay alive until you reach the safe, sandy beaches of the California coast.&#10;&#10;Three different stages of adventure cards create an experience of increasing difficulty and ensure that each playthrough is unique. Each round begins with an auction that determines both player order and which cards you will encounter. Since the resources used for bidding are the same as those used to battle the oncoming zombie hordes, your survival depends as much on your resource management as it does upon winning those bidding wars. The player who either accumulates the most points or survives the longest wins.&#10;&#10;Zombies of all types await, with cannibals, anti-personnel mines and radioactive wastes also being among the hazards awaiting the players.

    "description": "A game of political intrigue set in the Soviet Politburo of the early 20th century, with a satirical edge.  With politicians like Eduard Boremtodev, Nikolai Shootemdedsky and Natasha Nogoodnik vying for control of the party, you know the battle will be an entertaining one.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, a number of politician cards are laid out to fill the positions of the politburo.  Players then secretly note influence on ten politicians they hope to control during the game, indicated by a number from 1 to 10.&#10;Gameplay is not clockwise, but proceeds phase by phase with the politician holding the relevant office performing the appropriate action by the player who reveals the greatest influence on the politician in question.  Players attempt to remove politicians opposed to their interests by purging, exiling them to Siberia or by demoting them within the Politburo.  One&rsquo;s own preferred politicians can be promoted or pardoned of their previous &lsquo;sins&rsquo;. &#10;But each action a politician takes causes him (or in one case, her) to age by one or more years (a measure of the aging effect of the stress of the job). Each turn, politburo members face a health check which can result in the politician becoming ill, or even dying.  The 'older' a politician gets the more likely it is that he (or she) will become ill.&#10;At the end of each turn, the Party Chief must be healthy enough to wave to the crowd at the October parade. Controlling a politician who succeeds at this three times makes you the winner.&#10;&#10;The original Fata Morgana edition included rules requiring the players to hold funeral speeches for deceased party chairmen and drinking vodka with it, for instance. The later Avalon Hill edition scrapped these rules and gave the game a less satirical and more serious tone.&#10;&#10;Jolly Roger reimplemented an edition providing three different KREMLIN games in one box -See Kremlin (Third Edition)-:&#10;&#10;1: The 'original' with fictional politicians, set in a USSR where KGB investigations send those found guilty to Siberia. This version will have victory conditions based on the original Fata Morgana rules.&#10;&#10;2: A version inspired by the Avalon Hill variant titled 'Revolution'. Set in the 1920s, it uses historical politicians as well as fictional politicians. It's a more violent game as those arrested by the KGB are shot and removed from the game&#10;&#10;3: A new version, set in the modern USSR and Russia, an era of entrenched bureaucracy and alternatives for escaping KGB persecution. This version introduces the concept of &quot;Going into Exile&quot; to avoid Siberia. It also includes modern politicians from the 1960s onwards, whether it is Kosygin or Putin and Gorbachev.&#10;&#10;",

Then you may either fulfill the order of a ship on your shores or claim a business from a shared display and place it onto your island (or do nothing). Clever planning and timing is vital because until you supply the ships on your shores, they block valuable island space which could be used to collect more fruit &mdash; but if you concentrate too much on the ships, the most promising businesses may get snatched by your opponents. Also, the sooner businesses are claimed, the quicker the game might end.&#10;&#10;With each play, Juicy Fruits poses new puzzles of how to move your tokens efficiently and how to balance clearing your island with claiming businesses.

The scene is set in the ruins of a mighty kingdom, now inhabited by sparse groups of natives and swarms of monsters. Beneath it all are the rich remnants of a magical civilization, scattered and lost across the map.&#10;To this scene come the adventurers, seekers of riches and fame, to make a name for themselves in this promising field. Swordsman and Dwarf, Magician and Sorceror, the humans and the half-humans come seeking to loot the legendary riches of a lost civilization. Now you can play the part of one of these adventurers, stepping into an unknown Realm of magic and monsters, battles and treasures.&#10;&#10;As a player, you will take on the role of one of the sixteen major characters who are represented in detail in the game. You will control where he goes, what he tries to do, how he handles himself in combat, and much more. In the course of the game, you will run into deadly monsters, tribes of humans ranging from old friends to sworn enemies, and treasures that will enhance your abilities in many ways.&#10;&#10;MAGIC REALM is a complex game designed to recapture the suspense and desperate struggles of fantasy literature. The game creates a small but complete fantasy world, where each game is a new adventure with a new map where everything lies hidden at new locations. The game includes many more playing pieces than are actually used in a single playing. The additional pieces are set up and can appear, depending on the directions in which the characters explore, but many of the treasure troves, treasures, and spells will still be set up, unfound, when the game ends, and many of the monsters and natives might never be met. The result is an extremely unpredictable game full of surprises, a game that plays very differently each time it is played.&#10;The complete game system includes hiking, hiding and searching, fatigue, wounds, rest, trade, hiring natives, and combat between characters, monsters, and natives using a variety of weapons on horseback and afoot, as well as many magical effects.&#10;&#10;Between exploring a new land where the mountains, caves, valleys, and woods change every game, and not knowing what you will find in each place, you will find each game a new and unpredictable adventure, filled with surprises. You will find this like no other board game you have ever played.&#10;&#10;Avalon Hill Complexity rating - 9&#10;&#10;See also the list of articles about Magic Realm in The General.&#10;&#10;",
