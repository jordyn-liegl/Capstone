The game includes a core set of rules used in all three scenarios and scenario-specific rules unique to each game.  Optional rules add further chrome and complexity to the game.&#10;&#10;March to Peking depicts the Anglo-French attack on China in 1860 to force it to open itself up to European trade.  Special rules allow for the veteran Chinese Hunan army (engaged fighting the Taiping rebels elsewhere) to march to Peking's relief.&#10;&#10;Zulu War depicts the British campaigns in 1879 against the Zulus in South Africa.&#10;&#10;The Sudan covers three separate campaigns; the 1883-85 Mahdist uprising in Sudan, the defence of Khartoum in 1884-85, and the recapture of Sudan in 1896-98.&#10;&#10;The game consists of rules, two 34&quot; x 22&quot; maps and 620 counters.&#10;&#10;",

For this, a draw is carried out at each round, where players choose two dice, one to access a sector and the other to place it inside the necklace. The player must check if there is already a die with the same face in the selected sector, as there can only be one face of each type in each location.&#10;&#10;Players score points each time they fill an empty spot on the necklace and also receive points for links and for controlling areas within sectors. The game ends as soon as the players have no more space to fill in the necklace, the player with the most points wins the game.&#10;&#10;Masai is simple but intense and cerebral, don't miss this challenge and become the best Masai craftsman.&#10;&#10;",

You still have leaders with short names and shorter tempers looking over your shoulder and telling you want to do (handled in game terms with directives and procedures that turn your decision making choices as much into &quot;How do I please him?&quot; as &quot;How do I beat the enemy?&quot;) Counters represent mostly Soviet armies and German corps, with &quot;assets&quot; that can be attached to both, and minor Axis allies represented as well. Map scale is 55km to the hex, with 2 turns per month.&#10;&#10;The Battle of Stalingrad manages to provide monster game nuances in a game small in size with innovative design. For example, the sequence of play is not the same for each side. And why should it be? The Axis and Soviet armies do not do the same tasks each turn, because their armies operated differently.&#10;&#10;The Soviet player actually allocates supplies as he sees fit. Does he reward success or try to stave off defeat? Both players use Tactical and Strategic movement, as they move their forces around the battlefield. German Primary and Secondary objectives are determined randomly (and hidden from the Soviets!). Side operations in the Caucasus offer additional victory points but occupy units to achieve them. Are the points worth the cost?&#10;&#10;Operation Uranus, the great Soviet counteroffensive, has optional start times, with incentives for delay (if the rest of the Soviet front can hold out!).&#10;&#10;Sudden death victory is possible for both sides, encouraging that extra effort that could win it all...or leave one exposed and exhausted. At the end of the game, key point adjustments and multipliers get factored in and compared. Short of the Sudden Death victory, which side really &quot;wins&quot; can be in doubt to the very end.&#10;&#10;As it should be, in a situation like this.&#10;&#10;Part of the TPS, &quot;Decisive Battles&quot; series&#10;That means straightforward rules, key insights into the history behind the game, and designs aimed at one-session conclusions and high replay value. With shifting objectives and variable entry times for key units, no two Stalingrad games will play the same.&#10;&#10;",

They took advantage of each other to start controlling all sorts of private and public sector projects. Any excess budget from private projects was put into use to improve public services and infrastructures. Megacorporations that failed to give the impression that they were committed to helping the public weren&rsquo;t going to last long...  &#10;You are a CEO during this tough time, working to achieve your corporate goals and stay on top while doing your best to appease the crowds and dodge the attacks from your rival megacorporations.

    "description": "In Zoned Out, you take on the role of a developer trying to build a thriving metropolis from the ground up. To win, players will need to use the right combination of residential, commercial and industrial development as well as downtown construction to gain the most points.&#10;&#10;On their turn, a player selects one of the square city cards from their hand and adds it to the city, overlapping at least one existing square. They must then move their planner to one of the four squares of the new card. If they left the zone they were previously in, they will score points for the size of that zone with additional bonuses for connected parks and mansions and penalties for connected parking lots and abandoned houses. Zoning out also helps build one of the city's four downtown towers, which award points at the end of the game based on who contributed to each of them the most.&#10;&#10;Mastering Zoned Out takes good timing and clever card placement. In the game's advanced mode, players will also be competing to earn points from a variety of public and private objectives for the city.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Santa has his hands full and Christmas is just around the corner. What is worse, all his Elven helpers aren&rsquo;t well. In such circumstances Santa asked for help from his closest friends - the Vikings. You are the leader of one of the mighty Viking Horde which came to the shores of The Grateful Island. Your goal is to visit the local town homes and &ndash; obviously - deliver presents. Then you can in turn collect the tokens of gratitude left there for Santa!&#10;&#10;Giftbringer is a roll&amp;write game. To play you&rsquo;ll need 4 six-sided dice, the Rulebook and for each placer a pen/pencil and a Player Sheet. Before the start of the game randomly determine the Merry Leader (rolling player).&#10;&#10;The game itself consists of 10 Rounds. At the beginning of each Round the Merry Leader rolls the 4 six-sided dice. All players write down the roll results in the slots for the given Round on their Player Sheets. The results of the roll are the numbers that the players can use that Round. For each die roll the player can cross off a die symbol on one of the Vikings, one of the Roads or one of the Houses. Alternatively he can use one or two of those die rolls for a Special Action (Santa's Blessing), but each Special Action can only be used once per game.&#10;&#10;Initially each player has to Recruit a Viking - without one he cannot Visit the town itself. This also applies if a Viking already delivered all his Presents and the player has to Recruit another one. After having the first available Viking the player has to choose one of the Ships on the map to start his journey (this cannot be changed later, even with a new Viking). From that ship he can then start crossing the die symbols on Roads and Houses to visit them. He cannot jump over Houses or Roads and can only progress to an unvisited Road/House, adjacent to any of his already visited Roads/Houses.&#10;&#10;When a player crosses the die symbol on a Road segment leading to a House (including crossing a potential die symbol on the House itself), he visits the House. Then he has to cross the required number of Presents on his Viking (and the House) in order to get the token of gratitude available there (which he writes down under his Viking). Once all gratitude token spaces of a Viking are filled, that Viking has done his job and cannot be used anymore - the player has to Recruit another one. If a Happiness symbol is also present on the House, after delivering the Presents for that House the player marks the next available Happiness token on his track.&#10;&#10;After completing the last Round the player with the most points will be the winner of the game. Points are scored for each collected token of gratitude and for the achieved level of Happiness on a given player's Happiness track. Additionally, the final score can be influenced by the number of a given type of collected tokens of gratitude (e.g. 15 points for collecting 8 Cookies).&#10;&#10;",

The statistics of the historical runners have been modified so that they can compete with the current racers.&#10;&#10;Components are the rule book (a5 format), 7 sections of 'track' , four charts (summary, race pace/progress record and timing charts for 1500m and mile), 36 cards for runners and record sheets for races and a training log for the optional campaign rules.

Frequently played at conventions as a multi-player game, and the subject of many postal games in days gone by, the game was designed way back in 1986 as no more than another solo replay game, and its appeal to all shapes and sizes of gamers surprised me then and continues to do so. Or maybe not quite so much as it did, for I have to say that when I worked on it again recently ...&#10;&#10;... I appreciated the quick easy-to-understand-but-difficult-to-suss-out game system that does in fact produce races over this classic track distance ( one mile and 1,500 Metres, despite the title) that are accurate and realistic and yet require a lot of on-the-fly decisions for each runner.&quot;&#10;A quote by the Game designer&#10;&#10;Expanded By:&#10;&#10;    More Metric Milers&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Napoleon&rsquo;s Eagles 2: The Hundred Days, is the second game by designer Christopher Moeller in a series aiming to cover all of the great battles of the Napoleonic era.  Following Napoleon&rsquo;s Eagles: Storm in the East, The Hundred Days covers the Emperor Napoleon&rsquo;s Belgian campaign in 1815:  four battles that culminated in one of the most famous conflicts in history: Waterloo.&#10;&#10;Featured are the final four battles of the Napoleonic age: Quatre Bras and Ligny (June 16, 1815), and Waterloo and Wavre (June 18, 1815). Two campaign games allow the battles of the 16th and 18th to be played together, as well as a grand campaign that combines all four battles.&#10;&#10;While there are multiple scenarios presented in the game, each with its own special rules and conditions for victory, most battles are won by inflicting nine demoralizations on an opponent&rsquo;s army, before they do the same to you. Combat is a back and forth affair, using specially designed decks of playing cards. Combat is simple, fast and straightforward, but has a number of subtle wrinkles that you&rsquo;ll discover during play. Combat units, featuring glorious period artwork, represent infantry and cavalry formations, massed artillery formations, and those leaders operating at the highest levels (Wing and Army command).&#10;&#10;Product information&#10;Complexity: 5 out of 10&#10;Solitaire Suitability: High&#10;Time Scale: abstract (one full day of battle is 6 turns)&#10;Unit Scale: Infantry and Cavalry Corps&#10;Players: Two&#10;Playing Time: 30 to 90 minutes; 4 hours for large campaign&#10;&#10;Components&#10;225 Poker-sized cards which include 89 Unit Cards, 32 Terrain and Info Cards, and 104 Playing Cards&#10;Two Player Aid Cards&#10;Three Scenario Set-up Cards&#10;One Rules and Scenario Book&#10;1 Box and Lid set&#10;&#10;-description from publisher's website&#10;&#10;",

One player rolls the two dice &ndash; one showing colors, the other symbols &ndash; then everyone simultaneously tries to grab any discs showing the colored symbol determined by the die roll. If a die shows a white face instead of a color or symbol, then that characteristic is ignored for the round. For example, if the roll is white (i.e., blank) and red, then players can grab any disc with a red symbol. If both dice show white, then it's a free-for-all, with players grabbing as many discs as possible!&#10;&#10;A player can use only one hand to grab discs. If a player accidentally grabs the wrong disc, she must return that disc to the playing area, along with an additional disc as a penalty.&#10;&#10;When all the discs have been claimed, the game ends and the player with the most discs wins!&#10;&#10;",

Don&rsquo;t be afraid to purposely mess with other players!&#10;&#10;In Troublez players flip cards from one huge shared deck and sort zombies into three rows on the table. Every card must follow several placement rules. First, numbers can go only up and second, no two cards of the same color can be next to each other. When you successfully play a card onto the table, you can decide to stop and collect all the cards from a row of your choice, or you can push your luck and flip another card. If you cannot legally play a card, that is a bad luck and you are getting nothing!&#10;&#10;The deck consists of zombies in three colors, but cards with special abilities can be also found there. A Net allows you to steal a zombie card from another player. With A Shotgun you can discard some zombies others are holding and if you get An Axe, you must discard a card yourself. You can be clever with your cards, since after a players turn each other player gets to grab a card from the table. Will you leave them something good? Or will you maneuver so only The Axe is waiting there?&#10;&#10;To assemble a horde you must turn in a set of cards &ndash; four cards of the same number, or five cards of different numbers.

    "description": "Discovery (also sold as Destination Tresor in French, and Discovery Island in Sweden) is an interesting deduction game of discovery. Each player begins in an unknown location on an island (the opponent picks where the other starts), and each has the same goal: find the hidden treasure. The treasure is hidden in one of 28 spots on the island, and there are 7 clues available in special checkpoints to help determine where it is. The island is made up of 5 different types of terrain, and for each type of terrain there is a set of corresponding hexes.&#10;&#10;In play, one player calls a direction (Northeast, South, etc.) and the other player (who knows where you are) reveals a hex on the type of terrain you just stepped into. On the back of the hex there is a number, showing how many hours have been used.  Each turn, a player gets 12 hours worth of movement. By moving this way, you can eventually figure out where you are and then start moving with more accuracy.&#10;&#10;The game uses a clever device that reveals only one spot of a 6 x 6 matrix. A card, from a large set, is initially placed and this determines where the treasure will be for that game. When players get to a checkpoint, they can reveal that spot on the card to get a clue. The clues can tell you which of 4 types of treasure spots is &quot;live&quot;, and also the six surrounding terrain types. The board is well designed so that with a few clues you can narrow down the options of spots.&#10;&#10;Components (Based on Nordic 2002 version)&#10;-    2x Map boards     &#10;-    2x Plastic map sheets     &#10;-    1x Checkometer     &#10;-    28x Checkometer cards     &#10;-    18x Equipment cards     &#10;-    2x Whiteboard pencils     &#10;-    210x Terrain tiles divided as     &#10;-    - 20x Plain tiles     &#10;-    - 82x Jungle tiles     &#10;-    - 35x Mountain tiles     &#10;-    - 50x Swamp tiles     &#10;-    - 20x Outback tiles     &#10;-    - 4x Special tiles&#10;&#10;",

Five public objectives are revealed, showing players the seashells they want to collect &mdash; whether by type, color, or overall pattern &mdash; on their 3x4 treasure chest board. You receive two secret objectives, keeping one and discarding the other. If you wish, you can play with each player taking a mermaid character (each of which has a unique power) and a moonshell, which serves as a wild seashell.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you take three actions, repeating actions if you like. The actions are:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Rotate: Turn the game board 90&ordm; in the direction of the tide. &#10;    Pull 2: If the two rock spaces on the side of the game board next to you don't have any seashells on them, choose a column, place the first two seashells in this column on these rocks, slide the remaining seashells toward you, then draw from the supply bag to fill the empty spaces.&#10;    Collect: Take a seashell from a rock in front of you, and add it to your treasure chest, sliding the seashell to the bottom of the column in which you place it.&#10;&#10;&#10;If the bag runs out of seashell tiles, add the sea urchin tiles to the bag and continue playing. When someone has filled their treasure chest with twelve tiles, finish the round, then score. The &quot;trove&quot; objective scores only for the player who has the most seashells of that type or color, whereas the other four types of objectives &mdash; collector, array, pairs, composition &mdash; can be scored by each player, sometimes multiple times. You also score 1 point for each sea urchin and if you achieved your secret objective, you score for that, too. Whoever scores the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

At that time the family with the most glory points earns the right to the hand of the princess and wins the game.&#10;&#10;Integrates with:&#10;&#10;    Slavika: Equinox&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The naval and aerial combat that surrounded Guadalcanal are assumed to have their historical results so only historical reinforcements are available.&#10;&#10;The &quot;Basic Game&quot; introduced the components: the map board, unit counters, victory conditions, movement, zones of control, and combat.&#10;&#10;The &quot;Tournament Game&quot; the effects of different terrain types, reduction of units due to combat rather than wholesale elimination, ranged artillery fire, and point-based victory conditions.&#10;&#10;The &quot;Optional Rules&quot; introduced hidden movement, supply rules, different ranges for different artillery units based on their historical composition, withdrawing units from the island, and specialized capabilities for amphibious tractor and engineer units. Records for step reduction were kept on paper side records, rather than using reduced units (as in Anzio: The Struggle for Italy &#226;&#128;&#147; 1943-1945); records for hidden movement were also kept on paper, rather than using screens to hide each player's view of the opponent's forces as in Midway.&#10;&#10;The game victory conditions in the basic game were that the United States won if the Japanese were unable to hold Henderson Field for two consecutive turns between the September 25 and November 20 turns, inclusive, with the game ending on November 20 turn. The Tournament Game extended until the January 29, 1943 turn, with the point-based victory determined based on points awarded for eliminating enemy combat factors, occupying Henderson Field, or (for the Japanese) having Henderson Field in range of their artillery units.&#10;&#10;Avalon Hill discontinued the game before assigning it a complexity rating; however, in the  Avalon Hill &#039;&#039;General&#039;&#039;, Volume 3, Number 6, Avalon Hill assigned to the game the following characteristics:&#10;&#10;     Playing Time: 2-4 hours&#10;     Play Balance: Even&#10;     Complexity: Very Complex&#10;     For Beginner: Very Poor&#10;     Play-By-Mail: Poor&#10;     Suggestion: Use of Optional Rules&#10;&#10;&#10;The rules were revised to a small extent in their second printing in June, 1966.

As representatives of the IWC, you will go on missions to research and protect endangered fauna. Each mission revolves around a specific animal, including the collection of data on related animals, in order to gain a better understanding of the behavior, habitat, and other important features of the animal being studied.&#10;&#10;Animalia: Preventing Extinction is a co-operative card game in which you will attempt, on behalf of the IWC, to conduct research on endangered animals. As you do so, you will also raise funds that the IWC can use to protect animals and create global awareness of the animals&rsquo; plight. These goals can only be achieved if you communicate well and work together as a team.&#10;&#10;Each round consists of a series of 8 turns for each player, called tricks. The first Animal card played in a trick determines that trick&rsquo;s color. The other players must follow suit by playing an Animal card of the same color, if possible. Whoever plays the highest-valued card in a trick&rsquo;s color wins that trick. That player moves the trick&rsquo;s cards to their personal trick pile, which is kept facedown beside them. When all tricks are played, each player with one or more Mission cards must fulfill their mission(s) by collecting (in their trick pile) all of the Animal cards listed on their Mission card(s). If even one of the missions has not been successfully completed, the players immediately lose the game. However, if all players&rsquo; Mission cards have been successfully completed, those Mission cards are set aside and the players continue on to the next round.&#10;&#10;Animalia: Preventing Extinction also offers a campaign mode. The campaign game can be played in solo, two-player, and three-player mode. For setup, select how many and which continents you will play in a row. Any money earned will continue to the next continent. If you fail at any moment during the campaign, you have not succeeded in completing the campaign.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "HIR&THORN; (pronounced hirth) is a two-player abstract strategy game in which two leaders (Viking kings) fight over control of a piece of land. The first to either control the five middle spaces or push the other player's king off the board wins. Although it has a relatively small board (eleven squares), the ability to use moves to build stronger units makes the gameplay quite intricate. The game is designed in recent times but with the ambition of resembling a game that could potentially have been found in a Viking grave.&#10;&#10;In the game, the players start on each short end of the board and take turns. Each turn they can make five moves. For a move, a player either moves one piece (Hird or King) one step, moves a Hird into or off a Karve (boat), or moves a Karve and all Hirds on it one step. A Karve may have at most four Hirds on it. Pieces entering empty spaces have to stop. Pieces entering enemy-controlled spaces stop on the line between the spaces. After a player's five moves, any conflicts (pieces on lines) are resolved. All pieces except empty Karve are worth 1. The King is tiebreaker. In case of a loss, solitary Hirds are removed from the game, Karves and Hirds in Karves are removed from play, and Kings have to retreat to an adjacent empty or friendly space. If there are no possible squares for the King to move to, the player loses. If after their turn a player controls all five middle spaces, that player wins.&#10;&#10;There is also a doubling coin in the game affecting points received if several games are played. Normally a game is won after receiving five points.&#10;&#10;",

But even if they are not sure, every time nectar is dropped into a tube they can hear if a drop of nectar falls into an empty tube, or onto few or many other drops, thus giving them an audio clue to lucrative flowers. In a second step they move from flower to flower, collect the drops and try to fill their personal honey jar first, to win the game.&#10;&#10;A clever mix of mechanisms and a beautiful 3D set-up, plus audio clues mitigating the memory factor and giving equal chances to kids and their older siblings or parents &ndash; all of this makes Honey not only sweet but delicious.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "&quot;Operation Spark: The Relief of Leningrad 1943&quot;, is a simulation of the Soviet military offensive (Operation Iskra) during World War II, designed to break the German Wehrmacht's Siege of Leningrad. Planning for the operation began shortly after the failure of the Sinyavino Offensive. The German defeat in the Battle of Stalingrad in late 1942 had weakened the German front. By January 1943, Soviet forces were planning or conducting offensive operations across the entire German-Soviet front, especially in southern Russia, Iskra being the northern part of the wider Soviet 1942&ndash;1943 winter counter offensive&#10;&#10;The city of Leningrad, second largest in the USSR, had been cut off by the Germans since September 8, 1941. Now, sixteen months later, the Soviets were about to make their third attempt to relieve the city. The first attack in January 1942 had led to the mauling of the 2nd Shock Army in the swamps to the south, and a second failure between Sinyavino and Mga in the summer of 1942 had also taken heavy casualties, although it had completely derailed von Manstein's planned assault on the city itself. Now in January of 1943 the Red Army was set to try again.&#10;&#10;Uses the same game system rules as the following Clash of Arms Games wargames, the award winning Black Sea Black Death, Aachen and Borodino &#039;41.&#10;&#10;The game is set in a frozen peat bog, bordered by a frozen lake and a frozen river, is a slugging match. German fortified lines cut through the snow filled woods and encircle the worker's settlements and the critical Sinyabino Heights.&#10;&#10;The Red Army appears for the most part in regiment sized units of riflemen, artillery and heavy mortars, backed up by battalions of tanks (half of them light T-60s), skiers, marines, engineers, as well as by naval artillery, air power, and a few odd units like aerosans and observation balloons.&#10;&#10;The Germans have most of their units in infantry and artillery battalions, backed up by companies of Tiger and Pzkw.III tanks, deadly 88mm flak guns, and STUG IIIs. The Germans also field everything from a battalion of Spanish fascists to a railroad battery. They also field battalions of heavy artillery, nebelwerfers, and captured French coastal guns, as well as mountain troops, jaegers, the SS Polizei Division, and several overstrength independent regiments plus their Tiger tanks (here seen in their debut performance).&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Turn: Impulses = 4-5 hours, 5-6 impulses per day&#10;Hex: 880 yards / 804 meters&#10;Units: Company to Regiment&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 22 x 34&quot; full-color mapsheets&#10;Three dual-side printed countersheets (2 combat, 1 markers - 620 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 32-page Operation Spark rules booklet&#10;Six Player Aid cards&#10;Two 10-sided dice&#10;&#10;Players: 1 or more&#10;Playing Time: 2-20 hours&#10;Complexity: Medium&#10;Solitaire Suitability: Moderate&#10;&#10;",

Players are wizards who use their energy to power spells and collect ingredients from the game board. Collect the right combination of ingredients &ndash; which varies depending on the number of players &ndash; and you win!&#10;&#10;Spell cards are the heart and soul of the game. You get two random spells at the start of each game, then can acquire more via short, &quot;once around&quot; auctions at the start of each round. You bid energy cubes in these auctions, and you have only ten, so bid wisely. When you win an auction, you place energy cubes equal to your bid on the spell card. A certain number of these cubes are removed from the card at the end of each round; once the final cube is removed, the spell leaves the game and you lose that power.&#10;&#10;Spell cards generate the Element cards depicted on them for their owners. You then use these Element cards to bid on and collect Ingredients. You can bid for Ingredients only with the Elements shown on the landmark tokens on areas of the game board; these tokens are placed randomly each game. To increase the strategy and player interactivity, some Spell cards let you bid extra cards or different cards, while others allow you to change the rules for bidding. After visiting 3-6 areas, with the number being determined by a die roll at the start of the round, the round ends and players remove Energy cubes from their spells.&#10;&#10;The game ends as soon as a player collects the required number of ingredients, e.g., in a six-player game, five differently colored ingredients or six ingredients in any combination of colors.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Nomad is a family game for more experienced players. &#10;A nomadic tribe decides to move their camp to a remote but more suitable land. The chief hunter sets off to explore the unknown area and find the best route, and he will also acquire food for the tribe by hunting. However, the outcome of his actions will be largely determined by the prayers of the tribe&rsquo;s shaman.&#10;&#10;The game is played in 12 rounds. Players have their own terrain boards where they advance their hunter and move their camp (a yurt) towards the desired location in the farthest corner of the board.  At the beginning of each round, the shamans offer sacrifices to the Goddess of Nature on the shaman hill. This will determine the order of players, and therefore the outcome of the next, preparation phase. Finally, players execute their actions: exploration by placing terrain tiles on the board, hunting, or moving their camp further.&#10;&#10;When the game ends, players add up their scores received for the areas explored, the animals hunted and the distance they have reached with the camp. In addition, they can earn various bonuses for terrain tiles positioned in a smart way. Connected areas of the same terrain type on their board may also give multiple points, depending on size; some of these are easier, some more challenging to build. The player with the highest scores wins.&#10;&#10;In Nomad, everyone builds the landscape for themselves, but this is by no means a solitary experience. Although there is a good deal of interaction during the first two phases, players make decisions on their own. This game is ideal for 2-4 players, playing time is about 1 hour.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)&#10;&#10;A Nomad csal&aacute;di j&aacute;t&eacute;k, gyakorlottabb j&aacute;t&eacute;kosok sz&aacute;m&aacute;ra. &#10;Egy nom&aacute;d t&ouml;rzs elhat&aacute;rozza, hogy &aacute;tk&ouml;lt&ouml;zteti a t&aacute;bor&aacute;t egy t&aacute;volabbi helyre.

    "description": "Hungarian Tarokk, also known as H&uacute;szash&iacute;v&aacute;sos tarokk (XX-calling tarokk), or Paskievics tarokk, is a four player, variable partnership, trick taking tarot game. As with most games in this genre, the base objective of each round is to capture a certain amount of card points (in this case, more than half) in tricks. However, each round of Hungarian Tarokk starts with a peculiar round of auctions and announcements that impart a lot of information about the players' hands, which make it a very skillful, challenging, yet surprisingly accessible game.&#10;&#10;It uses a shortened pack of 42 cards: the trump suit consists of 22 cards while the other four suits consist of only five cards each. The size of each player&rsquo;s hand is only nine cards (with a talon of six cards).&#10;&#10;Each round starts with a short auction in which players bid for the right to choose a partner that holds a particular high ranking trump card, usually the XX. The bid itself determines the number of cards the winner of the auction may exchange (higher bids mean less cards exchanged) and the base value of  game (to capture more than half of the card points in tricks) in points.&#10;&#10;Players have restrictions on how they may bid; in particular, a player may only bid only if he or she holds an honour (the lowest trump, the second-highest trump, or the highest trump). In addition, there are bidding conventions that, unlike Bridge, are part of the rules. These conventions, or &quot;invitation bids,&quot; indicate if a player holds a particular high ranking trump.&#10;&#10;After players exchange cards with the talon, there is a round of announcements. Partnerships can pursue additional objectives other than game:&#10;&#10;- Winning three-fourths of the card points&#10;- Winning all the tricks&#10;- Winning all three honours&#10;- Winning all four kings&#10;- Winning the last trick with the lowest trump&#10;- XXI-catch: Capturing the opponent's second highest trump with the highest trump&#10;&#10;During the round of announcements, a partnership may announce that they will accomplish one or more of these objectives, which doubles their value. A partnership may also challenge or kontra an announcement, which also doubles its value. These objectives are scored independently; a team can fail at accomplishing game but still accomplish (and score for) other objectives. Often, the value of these objectives is greater than game. For example, the base value of game ranges from 1 to 4 points, while the value of XXI-catch is 21 points.&#10;&#10;",

There are six different styles of performers, and at different times in the game, public opinion will favour different styles.  Public preference is determined by dealing out cards from a special deck.  The current opinion is always known, and a possible (but not necessarily accurate) forecast of future preferences is also provided.&#10;&#10;Each turn, public opinion changes (sometimes to match the forecast, and sometimes into something completely random), then players use a bidding system to acquire contracts with performers.  Once contracts have been negotiated, profit is calculated depending on how well performers match the public's desires.&#10;&#10;By the time twelve turns have been played (and possibly one or two turns sooner), the game will come to an end and the player with the highest score is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;The game was originally published by the designer in 1984 (or earlier).  Hexagames published a German edition (which is the only one that handles up to 8 players) in 1988.  Avalon Hill published their edition (with very minor changes) in 1990.&#10;&#10;",

Robots will need to work with and against one another to become the ultimate BetaBot worthy of entering Robotopia.&#10;&#10;BetaBotz takes minimal time to learn but includes enough variation in content and strategy that no two games are the same. The simultaneous mission feature of BetaBotz allows all players to participate during missions. There is a high level of engagement and interaction between the players so that everyone can have a blast through the entirety of game play!&#10;&#10;Players start BetaBotz with 40 bitz (currency) and use this starting pool to bid on a robot body with stats in four attributes (Agility, Firepower, Structure and Processor). Throughout the game players use their remaining bitz and any bit rewards received to bid against one another on components that increase their attributes or select single use &quot;Code Cards&quot; in an effort to complete missions. In addition to components increasing a robot's ability to complete missions, achieving a stat of 13 or more in an attribute activates a power associated with that attribute.&#10;&#10;A complete game of BetaBotz is played over the course of ten missions. Mission cards of different tiers are selected based on the number of players. Missions require at least a specific value in one (or multiple) of the four attributes to complete. All players attempt to complete the current mission simultaneously and those that are successful receive a reward of bitz. Players are able to form teams to complete the current mission but they must split the mission rewards among the team. At the conclusion of the 10th mission the player with the highest individual attribute, the most gold components and code cards each receive an additional bitz reward. The player with the most bitz at the end of the game, including the bonus bitz, is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "CO-OPS was imagined by three graduates of the special military school of Saint-Cyr (General Saint-Hillier class, 2015-2018). Designed as part of the simulation courses to provide a training tool for future section leaders, the game emphasizes cooperation between players against an enemy played by the game itself. Each player takes the lead of an infantry platoon, a tank platoon or a helicopter squadron of the French Army and you will all need to cooperate to win the battle against armed terrorist groups; close coordination between the different arms is the key to victory.&#10;&#10;CO-OPS is based on simple mechanisms that can be explained in a few minutes, the depth of the game lies in the interactions between players. All players will have to get along and coordinate to conduct a complex joint operation, first to overcome the inevitable friction of battle and penetrate the fog of war... and then to triumph over the enemy.&#10;&#10;Start by choosing one of the 10 scenarios, which can be played alone or as part of the campaigns, but you may as well invent one from scratch thanks to the wide variety of units provided in the game box and the modular terrain tiles that allow you to compose an infinite number of geographical situations. Then, each player chooses the section they will command (infantry, cavalry, helicopters) and composes it at their convenience, thanks to a very simple budget system. Time for action, now!&#10;&#10;Every turn (about 15 minutes of real time), enemy units leave their bases and move automatically, via the squares of the game board (about 100 meters of real terrain), towards their objectives... or towards your closest units. When combat occurs, and it will, several parameters determine the chances of success for each side: detection capacity, weapon range, firepower, ability to take fire and of course the nature of the terrain. A simple dice roll determines the outcome of the battle, with fortune often smiling to the player who has given themselves the best chances. Each weapon has its own strengths and weaknesses, and by smartly combining them, you can increase the former while reducing the latter. The battle lasts for a long time, as a scenario can last up to 15 turns. Also, each player will have to regularly resupply their units, reinforce them to make up for losses, while keeping an eye on their morale level.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Publisher's blurb:&#10;&#10;As 1941 moved from winter into spring, and then into summer, it was becoming increasingly apparent that war was coming to the United States. Most American political and military leaders viewed the Nazi war machine in Europe as the most menacing of all, and fear that US intervention/involvement may come too late grew with each passing month. Most who viewed the escalating conflict in Asia felt that diplomacy and economic sanctions could bring Japanese aggression on that continent to an end, and even if military force was needed, US and western military prowess would make short work of the armed forces from the empire of the Rising Sun. The sudden and devastating attack at Pearl Harbor on December 7th, the devastating air raids in the Philippines the next day, as well as the loss of Great Britain's battleships Repulse and Price of Wales brought the war home in a shocking and horrifying manner.&#10;&#10;Despite the pre-war warnings and plans only in the Pacific, the Phillipines, and China there were Americans ready and able to fight the Axis forces. Of those, only a small group of American mercenary airmen and ground crew who were desperately outnumbered, led by man who had been vilified and disdained while in the US Army Air Force, met with success in the opening weeks of the war.&#10;&#10;Chennault's First Fight appears in Against the Odds Magazine #12, by designer Paul Rohrbaugh. Chennault's First Fight covers the Pacific War's opening, when a small group of American mercenary airmen and ground crew, desperately outnumbered and led by a man (Claire Chennault) who had been vilified and disdained while in the US Army Air Force, found their operations repeatedly crowned with success.&#10;&#10;Chennault's First Fight covers the first weeks of war in Burma, from mid-December 1941 to the Fall of Rangoon in early March 1942. The focus of the game is on the aerial battles, but the ground campaign is also covered, albeit on a simpler level.&#10;&#10;Air units represent groups of 6 to 8 aircraft, while ground units are mostly brigades and regiments. The area map stretches from the Indian Frontier to French Indochina and from the Himalayas to south of Rangoon. An interactive turn sequence keeps both players hopping. There are two levels of air combat resolution, basic and advanced. The basic level has up to 3 rounds of air combat that are resolved on a &quot;battle board&quot; that also uses area movement. The advanced combat resolution system uses a hex map with more turns, very similar to the classic AH game Richtofen's War.&#10;&#10;Air units are differentiated by type. Besides the P-40s flown by the Flying Tigers the Allies take wing with Brewster Buffalos, Hawker Hurricanes, P-36s, SB-2s, and Bristol Blenheims. The Japanese fly Oscar and Nate fighters. The heavy lifting is done by Sally, Ann, and Lily bombers while Dinah recon planes (among the fastest and highest flying prop planes built) lead the way. The Japanese must stike hard and fast and avoid getting sucked into what for them was a side-show. Running up a butcher's bill, or calling in forces badly needed elsewhere in the Emperor's warplan can lead to a lose of face and worse. The Allied player has precious little to waste in this fight, and must make the most of his opponent's weaknesses and mistakes while minimizing his own.&#10;&#10;Rules cover enhanced reinforcements for both sides, the Vichy, Aces, Amphibious Assaults, the possible intervention of the Japanese Kido Butai (Carrier Air Units) and weather. Plenty of carnage and mayhem!&#10;&#10;",

There's a large collection of islands that are going to be connected by bridges. Bridges are placed onto the board when the matching card is played. The kicker is that when a player gets a majority of the bridges on one island, his opponent's bridges from that island suddenly disappear. Once the deck has been exhausted three times, the dominant force on the islands wins.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented as:&#10;&#10;    Kahuna&#10;    Kanaloa&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The Governor issued a desperate plea for help.  You play one of the best and bravest Adventurers in the world called to Transylvania to break the curse.  Your goal is to find the Knowledge to break the curse over Transylvania but beware, the Knowledge you seek may just turn you into one of the terrible Monsters you have come to destroy.&#10;&#10;Transylvania: Curses &amp; Traitors is a heavily themed adventure and exploration game utilizing a modular board, variable player powers, hand management, and dice rolling.&#10;&#10;Paths to victory include:  1. Solving the curse of Transylvania by finding the right combination of Knowledge cards and returning your pawn to the Church Tile.  2.  Becoming a Monster (vampire, werewolf, or zombie) by collecting Transformation cards and then killing half the other players.  3. Killing a Monster as an Adventurer.&#10;&#10;Game play:  The board consists of sixteen 6&quot; x 6&quot; tiles representing places in Transylvania such as the Church, Graveyard, and Castle.  Adventurers start on the Church Tile and explore uncovering new tiles.  Each tile contains token spaces which are opportunities to perform challenges of strength, mental acuity, and spiritual fortitude.  A successful challenge results in the reward of a Quest card.  The Quest deck contains the Knowledge cards needed to break the curse.  While exploring Adventurers will also encounter Events.  Failure of Events leads to injury and/or death while success leads to additional rewards.  If Adventurers collect Transformation cards plus a card that activates the Transformation card, they become a Vampire, Werewolf, or Zombie.  The goal of the game immediately changes from seeking Knowledge to eliminating the other players by attacking them.&#10;&#10;",

Unlike the full board game, which is focused on two dimensions (giving and getting), this is a card game focused on simply giving gifts that people like.  It is also suited to playing in teams, unlike the board game which is very much about you, the individual.&#10;&#10;GiftTRAP lite is played over a series of rounds where players/teams take turns to be the judge and receive gits from their friends.  This is a game where less really is more. Each player can give 1, 2 or 3 gifts (as a collection). The judge must decide which collection is best.  Giving just 1 gift will get you three points, two gifts = two points and three gifts just one point, so the better you know the judge the more likely you can win more points with less cards.&#10;&#10;The winner is the player/team with the most points after each player/team has been the judge twice.&#10;&#10;This game is produced as a standalone game, that also happens to double as an expansion to the main game simply because the gifts included can be combined with the main game.  You can of course play this game with the contents from the original game.&#10;&#10;",

This won't be easy, under the watchful eyes of husbands and associated private secretaries. But if it were easy then there would be no fun in it, would there?&#10;&#10;The Shooting Party is a solitaire game that can be played with a standard pack of cards. Your hand represents the guests in the room with you; manage their comings and goings within the strict rules of etiquette so as to reduce your hand to a single queen. Once alone with her you can score her and take her jewels (ace) if available. How many queens and aces you take determines your final score, from impecunious boor to filthy (rich) scoundrel.&#10;&#10;",

It now play 1-4 players and consists of numerous Heroes and Henchmen to choose from to delve in the dungeon below. Here are some game highlights.&#10;&#10;1)Bluffing and Blind Bidding. Players are attempting to destroy the nasty creatures below in the dungeon to gain fame by playing cards face down and revealing simultaneously. Each enemy has a set number of hit points based on the number of players. There are three enemies to deal with in each level of the dungeon, so strategy, tactics, and bluffing are a must. There is also two rounds of bidding so players gain insight into what other players are up to.&#10;&#10;2)Deck Building. When a player defeats an enemy, that card is rotated 180 degrees and then added to the player's discard pile. The bottom of each monster card indicates what item the enemy is carrying. These items add power to your character in future rounds, and act as an organic and thematic way to show that your characters are advancing.&#10;&#10;3)Draft Your Unique Party. Before play begins, players complete a draft in order to create their starting hand of twelve cards. Each player gets one Hero and one Henchman. All characters are very unique and play quite differently from one another. This sets the bar high for replay value!&#10;&#10;4)No Down Time! Since all play is done simultaneously, no players are ever waiting on others for very long. This makes Of Dungeons Deep! one of the fastest dungeon delvers out there.&#10;&#10;",

On most turns, you will form a boarding party by taking a stack of pirates in front of you (with a stack consisting of one or more tokens with you on top), moving them on top of a stack in front of another player, then moving the new stack back in front of you.&#10;&#10;On a future turn, you may use this stack to capture one of the four cards in the display as long as the size of the party meets the minimum requirements. The pirate on top of stack is the captain, and they receive a treasure for leading the raid. (The second pirate in the stack, the mate, might also receive a treasure.) They collect the gold listed on the card, then must pay the value listed on each pirate in their crew, making up any gold they lack from their own coffers. If they do this, they keep the card and increase their scoring.&#10;&#10;You can mutiny by placing a stack on another stack, then going after one of the four cards immediately, but you must then pay the mate and the rest of the crew double their pay.&#10;&#10;After all cards have been captured and the game ends, players receive additional gold based on the relative number of treasures they have captured.

Choose your favorite NFL team (All 32 teams are represented) and outsmart your opponent by calling the play on both offense and defense. Choose the right play and get rewarded&hellip; but you&rsquo;ll also need a little luck. Roll the dice to see if that big gain will go for extra yardage or if a key play will result in a turnover. Each team comes with 2 specific &quot;Big Play&quot; cards that embody the core strengths of that team. Use each card only once per half to change the outcome of a play. Clock winding down? Line up for a field goal and take your chances at kicking the ball through the uprights.&#10;&#10;In more detail...&#10;&#10;Starting The Game&#10;Choose Rookie or Pro Mode. The two game modes allow players at any skill level to get into the game!&#10;- Rookie Mode- For newer NFL players.&#10;- Pro Mode- For experienced players and fans.&#10;Pick your team and grab your team's Scoring Footballs and Big Play cards!&#10;&#10;Picking Your Play&#10;The offense has 4 downs to either advance the ball 10 yards for a first down, score a touchdown, kick a field goal, or punt.&#10;&#10;Both Offense and Defense choose a play card from their set of Playbooks. If the Defense correctly predicts what play the Offense is running it will result in a good outcome for them. However, if the Defense choose poorly, the Offense could pull off a big gain!&#10;The Offense announces what play book both sides will be choosing from.&#10;&#10;Running a Play&#10;Each team chooses a play card and places it face down at the Line of Scrimmage. When ready, both players flip over their cards at the same time to reveal the outcome of the play:&#10;Find the circled player on the offense card and follow the arrow down to the defense card to see the result.&#10;Move the Line of Scrimmage marker the same number of yards as the result of the play.&#10;Also, move the First Down marker and the Down Tracker Chip.&#10;&#10;Distance and Passing Dice&#10;Some plays may indicate that dice need to be rolled for the result of a play. Roll the indicated color dice to show the yards gained or lost on a play. The white passing die is also rolled to determine the outcome:&#10;    Catch- The pass is complete, and the offense gains yards.&#10;    Turn Over- The defense intercepts the pass and gains possession of the ball at the spot of the catch.&#10;    X- The pass is incomplete, the ball remains at the current yard line.&#10;&#10;Big Play Cards&#10;Each team has 2 Big Play cards that showcase that team's strengths. Use these cards to make a big play during the game! Big Plays add or remove yards from the end of a play.&#10;These cards are played after the Playbook Cards are flipped over.&#10;Only ONE Big Play card can be played per down- the first player to place a Big Play on the game board gets to play the card.&#10;Once a card is played, it is discarded for the remainder of the half.&#10;&#10;Kicking Field Goals&#10;Use the Flicker Kicker to literally kick the ball off the Line of Scrimmage on any down. Place the field goal posts behind the end zone, lined up between the lines marked on the game board.&#10;&#10;If the kick is good- and passes through the field goal post uprights and above the crossbar, then that team scores 3 points.&#10;If the kick misses- and does not pass through the field goal posts, then the other team starts their next possession.&#10;&#10;Just line up the kick, pull back on either the tab or the kicker foot, and release to send the football flying through the uprights!&#10;&#10;Officially licensed product of the National Football League&#10;Includes all 32 NFL teams&#10;&#10;Game Contents&#10;64 Big Play Cards&#10;19 Playbook Cards&#10;3 Distance Dice&#10;1 Passing Dice&#10;32 NFL Team Footballs for Scoring&#10;1 Scoreboard&#10;3 Scoreboard Clips&#10;1 NFL Showdown Game Board&#10;1 Field Goal Post&#10;1 NFL Flicker Kicker&#10;1 NFL Football&#10;1 Line of Scrimmage Marker&#10;1 First Down Tracker&#10;1 Down Tracker Chip&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "All Things Zombie: Final Fade Out is a miniature skirmish game set in a post-apocalyptic future where the world is filled with hordes of Zombies, leaving humans to fight for survival each day. The rulesystem is designed for 28mm miniatures but can also be used with 15mm models. Two Hour Wargames's popular Reaction System allows for cross-game compatibility and recreates a sense of chaos and uncertainty in the bleak future; player will never know how each encounter will end as characters act like real humans would in a tense situation, as opposed to how you would like them to act! Each model has only a few stats to keep track of. A typical scenario might see a small band of Stars (the player's models) and Grunts (their fellow survivors) search a town for supplies like food, gas, or ammunition; What they encounter on the streets and in each building is determined randomly and ranges from friendly survivors willling to trade or join the team to hostile Gangers or a horde of hungry Zombies. Where ATZ:FFO really shines though, is the comprehensive campaign system, allowing for character development similar to a role-playing game. The game can be played solo, cooperatively, or against each other.&#10;&#10;From the publisher's product page:&#10;&#10;&ldquo;BETTER TO BURN OUT THAN TO FADE AWAY.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Mankind has had a good run. Mankind has burned brightly over the centuries meeting every challenge head on and conquering each one. Even the self-inflicted challenges, conquered them all&hellip;until now.&#10;&#10;ZOMBIES. YOU KNOW WHAT WE&rsquo;RE TALKING ABOUT.&#10;&#10;Everyone knew about Zombies. The fun new boogie man you couldn&rsquo;t get away from. They were everywhere. On the Web, on your television screen, everywhere you looked. Yep, nothing but fun and brains for all! Right up until they became real.&#10;&#10;HOW&rsquo;D IT HAPPEN? WHAT STARTED THE OUTBREAK?&#10;&#10;Who knows and who cares? When you meet your first Zombie or see your first Zombie Feast all those questions disappear. All you care about is staying alive. And that&rsquo;s what All Things Zombie &ndash; Final Fade Out is all about, staying alive. All Things Zombie - Final Fade Out picks you up and sticks you right in the middle of a catastrophic zombie outbreak. Where you are, is just as important as who you are, when the outbreak occurs. Because unlike other zombie games, where the zombies have been around for a while, you won&rsquo;t be able to tell the survivors from the zombies until maybe it&rsquo;s too late. Hell, they could even be a relative! Because it&rsquo;s all happening to you just like it would on Z Day - 1. Confusion, chaos, and lack of information are just some of the challenges you&rsquo;ll face when the world starts to crumble. Will you have what it takes to survive the first 30 days? After that it&rsquo;s all up to you. Maybe you want to rebuild the world, as you knew it; except maybe this time with you in charge.&#10;&#10;All Things Zombie - Final Fade Out!&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "On this peaceful seaside beach, crab season has come! Hunters and gatherers are coming from near and far, searching for delicious-looking crabs under every rock and pool. The game is plentiful, but due to space limitations you can keep only one crab per catch; maybe you can upgrade your gear to keep bigger crabs, or maybe you can try to fulfill custom orders for special guests...&#10;&#10;As a renowned crab hunter in Crabs!, you cannot miss this carnival, so grab your gear and let's going crabbing! Each turn you choose one of the following actions:&#10;&#10;&#10;        Catch: Draw two cards from the deck or pool.&#10;        Raise: Exchange cards with the pool, crabs for crabs.&#10;        Trade: Exchange cards with the pool, points for points.&#10;        Upgrade: Discard cards to upgrade gear level.&#10;        Tie Crabs: Discard cards to gain a score card.&#10;        Relax: Untap up to three score cards.&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;At the end of your turn, you can choose to trade score cards for a single objective card, then you must discard down to eight cards. When a player has gathered 25 or more VP, the game continues until all players have had the same number of turns, then the game ends and whoever has the most VP wins!&#10;&#10;(Note that some versions of Crabs! carry a minimum player count of three, whereas others have a minimum p.c. of two, but the rules for the game seem to be the same across all versions.)&#10;&#10;",

Welcome to Medang, a Hindu-Buddhist civilisation from the Java island, where you'll have to lead one of its five major dynasties and build a temple.&#10;&#10;You'll be part of the Samara, the Dharmasetu, the Dharanindra, the Panangkaran or the Rakai dynasty and battle to take control of the temple. Be smart and develop a good strategy because you'll have to collaborate to build the temple, but only the dynasty that places the most tiles will be declared the winner.&#10;&#10;In turns, you'll place the tiles to build the temple, activating their special skills if you choose to. All the players will have access to a tile market to replace those that you use to build the temple.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Quick minds and fast fingers will triumph!&quot;&#10;&#10;Part of the publisher's Fun to Go card game series, this tin contains 72 cards, each picturing 4 concentric rings. The rings are blue, magenta, purple and green, in varying orders. All the cards are dealt out with one put on the center of the table. Players draw cards one at a time from their pile, forming a hand, and without taking turns begin adding to the central stack. To place a card on top of the stack it must match one of the rings in both position and color. The card must also match a different ring from the previous match (outer, larger center, smaller center, or bulls-eye position). The first player to play all cards from their hand and draw pile wins.&#10;&#10;",
