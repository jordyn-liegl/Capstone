    "description": "In the game of Dicke D&auml;monen, the players are magicians trying to rule the world. Curiously the world is smaller than you might think because in the eyes of a magician the world consists only of magical power lines and power fields, specifically four power lines: earth, fire, air and water. Wherever these lines enfold the space, the power fields are created; wherever the lines cross each other, the corners of these fields materialize. (In game terms, four colored strings &mdash; each tied to a ring &mdash; are placed on the table overlapping one another at the start of the game.) The magicians summon ghosts and demons to rule the world &mdash; but at the start of it all nobody knows which type of creature will be the strongest:&#10;&#10;     Ghosts &ndash; white creatures &ndash; appear in the center of a power field, and wherever they are summoned, everything freezes in terror. Neither ghosts nor demons may appear in a power field once a ghost has been summoned there.&#10;     Demons &ndash; in the colors of the power lines &ndash; appear in the corners of the power fields adjacent to the lines of their color. No demon will enter a field where a ghost was summoned.&#10;&#10;&#10;Each magician summons again and again one of the four creatures at a place of his choice, thus filling the world with ghosts and demons. (Ghosts and demons are wooden pawns drawn from a cloth bag.) As soon as no more creature can be summoned, the fate of the world is decided &ndash; and one of the colors will be the strongest. Only once during the game can each magician predict a color, whether one of the demon colors or ghostly white, and each magician must predict a different color. (A player predicts a color by placing a pawn of the color in front of him.) This look into the future costs a lot of energy, and as soon as someone predicts a color, he will be harassed by fate and the other magicians. Thus, which color to predict is an important decision as well as when to predict it.&#10;&#10;The magician who predicted the color which is the the strongest in the end rules the world.&#10;&#10;",

When a druid is moved, he usually leaves a stone behind, and in this way stone circles are eventually created on the board. Each time a player gains the stone majority within such a circle, he places a dolmen with a hidden number (1 to 4) in its center. Over time, stacks of dolmen grow all across the board.&#10;&#10;The game ends as soon as any player runs out of dolmen or stones. For each dolmen a player has placed, he scores a number of points that depends on the dolmen's position within its stack as well as the size of the circle surrounding it. The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "(From the rear of the box:)&#10;&#10;The road to the Rhine, and beyond to Berlin, seemed wide open in the early fall of 1944. The German armies in France had ceased being organized formations and were streaming back to the Reich in willy nilly fashion, hotly pursued by the Western Allied armies as they dashed through Paris and to the borders of Germany. The First US Army (with the Ninth later on), hit the Westwall on September 12th and was destined to slog through the mud and rain for months against the fortifications and surprisingly resilient German reserves hurriedly thrown against them in a desperate bid to keep the American army off as much German soil as possible. Additionally, lack of supply served to further restrain the American advance. Would the war be over by Christmas, or would the Germans pull off a second &ldquo;Miracle of the Marne&rdquo; and hold long enough to launch a counteroffensive in the west ?&#10;&#10;&#10;(from Decision Games website:)&#10;&#10;HURTGEN: Hell&rsquo;s Forest is a grand-tactical simulation of that enormous campaign. The 2,240 counters in the game represent almost every formation, at company and battalion levels, which fought in the battle, including US, German, British, and even Belgian units. Infantry, armor, anti-tank, reconnaissance, engineer, assault gun, howitzer, rocket, parachute, ranger, glider, and headquarters units are all fully represented in the counter-mix. The two map sections are an accurate representation of the battle area and were compiled from 1944 German staff maps and 1943-1944 US Army map sources. The area portrayed shows all primary and secondary roads, trails and other types of terrain in relation to their suitability for armor and infantry, along with all the villages, towns and  cities that proved to be the bastions of the German defense, as well as every creek and river that couldn't be crossed by wheeled vehicles without a bridge.&#10;&#10;THERE are three main scenarios representing each of the offensive periods of September, October and November. A smaller learning scenario depicts the US 28th Infantry Division&rsquo;s ordeal as it attempted to drive on the Roer River dams through the forest of the area. Players may also play continuously from September to the first week of December (almost 300 game turns!). The big challenge for the allied player is to see if he can reach the Rhine River months ahead of the actual date, and shorten the war considerably. Extensive supply, weather and air power rules are included.&#10;&#10;THIS latest edition of the Grand Operational Simulation Series (which began with Wacht am Rhein) presents further refinements to the combat, artillery and supply subsystems in order to better depict tactical and operational warfare at this scale. For example, rules for &ldquo;Lull&rdquo; periods have been added in order to allow players to speed up game play during periods of relative inactivity. These Lulls compress game play from three turns per day to one, allowing players to cover longer intervals of historic time. Other additions feature level-two entrenchments that allow the German player to create fortified bastions in German towns and cities that can better withstand Allied barrages and ground assaults, along with rules that represent the logistical nightmare faced by the Americans during much of the battle.&#10;&#10;THE orders of battle have been extensively researched in order to provide an accurate and functional depiction of the armies of both sides. The incredibly hodge podge nature of the resurrecting German army is shown through the depiction of the various rear area units and replacement army battalions that appear almost randomly throughout the game.&#10;&#10;GAME SCALE&#10;&bull; Map: 1 mile per hex&#10;&bull; Time: 3 Game Turns per day&#10;&bull; Units: Infantry and Artillery are battalions. Armor is depicted at the company level.&#10;&bull; Each strength step is equal to a company.&#10;&#10;GAME COMPONENTS&#10;&bull;   2 22x34&rdquo; Four Color Map sheets&#10;&bull;   2,240 Die-Cut Playing Pieces (ACTUALLY 1,960!)&#10;&bull;   One Rule Booklet&#10;&bull;   One Scenario Booklet&#10;&bull;   One Full color Examples of Play Booklet&#10;&bull;   Player Aid Charts&#10;&bull;   Two 10-sided Dice&#10;&bull;   Storage Bags&#10;&bull;   11x17x2 inch box&#10;&#10;",

Yes, you have a hand of prisoner cards, and you want to send them through the tunnel so that no one remains behind.&#10;&#10;In more detail, from a deck of cards numbered 1-8, with leaders having a value of your choice when you play them, each player starts with a hand of twelve cards and five cards are randomly dealt face up into the &quot;cell&quot;, an area near the deck.&#10;&#10;On your turn, if the &quot;tunnel&quot; &mdash; an area in the center of play &mdash; is empty, you can play 1-3 cards. If you play more than one card, those cards must be the same value or in sequential order. (If you play a leader, declare its value if it's not obvious.) If the tunnel isn't empty, you may play the same number of cards as the previous player or one card more or fewer. If you can't play the proper number of cards or don't wish to, you pass, moving all cards in the tunnel to the discard pile.&#10;&#10;After passing, draw two cards, whether from the deck, the cell, or a combination; if you played, draw one card, after which you can draw one more, if you wish. (Refill the cell to five cards, if needed.)&#10;&#10;One wrinkle to what's above: Before you play or pass, you can &quot;shoot ahead&quot;, that is, add one card to the cards placed in the tunnel by the previous player, adding the same number if they played a set or adding a card to either end of their run. By doing so, you ditch one more card and give you a larger set to play off of.&#10;&#10;If you empty your hand, you don't draw and skip all future turns. When 1-2 players have &quot;broken out&quot; &mdash; or daybreak comes at the bottom of the deck &mdash; the round ends; everyone with cards in hand scores points equal to their hand size. After three rounds, whoever has the lowest score wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Bleeding Kansas is a two-player game portraying the politics and violence in pre-statehood Kansas. The Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854 gave new territories the right to &ldquo;popular sovereignty,&rdquo; allowing residents to choose whether or not to allow slavery. Within months the stream of settlers to Kansas was swelled by parties of sponsored abolitionists and pro-slavers, all more intent on fighting one another than building a new state. Bushwhacks and gun battles punctuated maneuvers by rival legislatures elected through massive fraud. It would not die out entirely until statehood in January 1861. The new state&rsquo;s senators swung the US Senate irretrievably against the South, ensuring the continuation of secession started by the election of Abraham Lincoln.&#10;&#10;The core of the game is the card system. Each card describes an important event, person, or factor in the conflict, and triggers associated actions in the game. Players alternate card play to influence settlers, build forces, control counties, sway politics, move friendly forces, disrupt or attack opposing forces, burn or rebuild towns, encourage migration, or request Federal intervention. The sequence of cards played not only determines the outcome of the game, but creates the narrative of this dramatic conflict.&#10;&#10;Take charge of your faction and gain control of Kansas.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Early in the morning of May 10, 1940, under the Codeword Danzig, Fallschirmj&auml;ger from the 7th Flieger Division and 22nd Luftlande executed surprise landings at Den Haag, on the road to Rotterdam and against the Fortress of Eben Emael in order to facilitate German Army Group B's feint advance in Belgium, while the main attack was conducted by stronger Army Group A led by seven panzer divisions from the Ardennes, through a terrain believed uncrossable to armor units. France and the UK reacted immediately, activating the Dyle-Breda Plan, and thus committing their best forces directly into the trap. Then in June the evacuation of Dunkirk was a partial success, but the battle for France was over with an astonishing German victory. Four years elapsed before the Western Allies would come back to the continent and thus finally defeat Germany.&#10;&#10;Blocks in the West (BITW) recalls, in game form, the most decisive battles fought in the European Theater Front from the invasion of France until the collapse of the Nazi regimen in May 1945. BITW is a game of World War II conflict simulation at the operational level. Although based on historical events and battles, the players in command of the two factions can modify the evolution of World War II on the Western Front. The game is recommended for two, three or four players: one/two control the Western Allies and the other one/two control Germany and Italy. The game is imminently suitable for solitary play: the single player just controls both sides. In this case, playing with Fog of War is mandatory.&#10;&#10;Developed on a wooden blocks and cubes system over an astonishing 124x87cm full-laminated multicolor map board, Blocks in the West includes no paper components other than the manual. All of the over 900 wooden/plastic components/stickers have been created by the best Italian artisinal industry and painted A buratto, a technique usually adopted for painting car parts and accessories. In terms of scale, a hexagon is approximately 44 miles (70 km) across, a game turn is one month long, and a full-strength counter represents a major military formation (normally a corps) of ca. 30,000 men, 300 Tanks or 300 planes depending on the unit type, equipment, nationality, etc&#10;&#10;The rules are divided into three major sections which can be learned one at a time. The basic game rules introduce the basic concepts and enables players to start playing the game without too many rules to remember. Then the advanced game rules provide more specific and detailed rules for an enhanced realism, such as the use of fuel and the advanced production system. Finally, for those players who want to get the best out of the game, optional rules can be added as desired; these include Technology Research, Strategic warfare over German factories and U-Boot Campaign in the Atlantic Ocean, Amphibious Invasions, and Parachute Assaults.&#10;&#10;Blocks in the West can be played standalone or combined with Blocks in the East and Blocks in Afrika.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Campaign Commander Volume II: Coral Sea&#10;&#10;Coral Sea is a new volume in the Campaign Commander series and simulates the campaign in the South Seas of the Pacific between the spring of 1942 and the spring of 1943. The Japanese expansion reaches its limit in the archipelago of the Solomon Islands and New Guinea. The Japanese initial force, the Army of the South Seas, began to expand reducing the boundaries of the Australian defenses from its base in Rabaul, the logistic center of Japanese control in the zone.&#10;The naval-air battle of the Coral Sea was a hard blow for the Japanese force since the Soho, their light aircraft carrier, was sunk, and the amphibious invasion force destined to take Port Moresby had to return to Rabaul without fulfilling their mission. Afterwards the imperial forces tried to take Port Moresby by a ground assault, extending their way along the Solomon Islands creating air bases and observation stations throughout the archipelago.&#10;The Japanese forces were thus threatening naval communications between the United States and Australia.  In response, the Allies reinforced Australia and the New Caledonia zone looking for an opportunity to counterattack and to stop the imperial tide extending through the region. The return to Australia of veteran units from the Middle East allowed the Allies to initiate an offensive in Papua/New Guinea that would last six bloody months and result in the Allied recovery of the enclaves of Buna and Gona on the North coast of New Guinea.&#10;&#10;In the Solomon Islands the North American counterattack began August 8th, 1942 and led to a lasting and bloody campaign through February 1943, with successive attacks and counterattacks of both sides resulting in Guadalcanal Island back in American hands. In addition to the ground forces, the region saw much use of air and naval operations.  Both navies accomplished herculean tasks to support their respective ground forces and supply them.  Their importance was noticeable, so air attacks on navies were numerous, and expensive in lives, planes and ships.  The last of them in this period was the battle of the Sea of Bismarck, which resulted in Allied air supremacy in the region.&#10;The Japanese Imperial navy based on the island of Truk made several raids in the region to support the small naval forces in the South Seas. But eventually the Japanese had to yield the initiative to the allies in the region as they exhausted their resources, fighting on two fronts.  The Allies exhausted the Japanese offensive, and they prepare to take their own offensive.&#10;&#10;The game is developed in an operational scale &ndash; area-based map with a scale 1:300,000.  It is designed for two players with one running the JAPANESE forces and the other the ALLIED forces. The game lasts approximately 3-4 hours and uses a two sided system to handle the mechanics of play: cards and counters.  The players will have to use their troops and their resources to obtain victory points while eliminating enemy forces and occupying cities in the map. It is not a card driven game as the cards are used to bring about events that influence battles, secure reinforcements, and provide resources with which to carry on the fight.&#10;&#10;In the beginning of the game the JAPANESE player will take the Initiative and will have to expand throughout the map to secure Victory Points. The ALLIED player is on the defensive, and will have to strength his forces as the game progresses. He will have to take advantage of every opportunity to inflict damage on the advancing Japanese forces.  The island of Guadalcanal will be crucial as the game develops, as are the results of actions in Papua/New Guinea.   &#10;The JAPANESE player must face the historical dilemma of concentrating on taking the Solomon Islands, Papua or both simultaneously.  The ALLIED player will have to be patient and force his opponent to extend himself, by accumulating forces and to committing lethal offensives that put the forces of the Empire of the Rising Sun in check. &#10;Like all the games of this Series, the rules are simple and straight forward.  Our objective was to create games that are very interactive, and offer players a pleasant creative experience.  We aim for solid games for players who do not have the time or the space to leave a game setup and in place over a long period of play.&#10;&#10;",

When characters are finally able to seize the relic it is drawn randomly from the Relic Deck. Relics grant an unnatural boon and are used just like upgrades, however they far surpass any upgrade in power. But if the character wielding the relic is disabled anyone can pick it up.&#10;&#10;Standard games of Relicblade are played on a 2'x2' area, and players usually only field between three and six characters. Standard games usually last around 45 minutes. Relicblade is fast paced, dynamic, and fun.&#10;&#10;",

Agents assigned to the Warehouse risk their lives to retrieve these artifacts to keep them away from nefarious individuals who seek to use the artifacts for personal gain. In Warehouse 13: The Board Game, players take on the role of Warehouse Agents who must work together to retrieve these artifacts. But is everyone looking out for the Warehouse's interests, or might one of the Agents be secretly working for the Warehouse's most ruthless adversary?&#10;&#10;Warehouse 13: The Board Game can be played by three to five players in about two hours. Each game of Warehouse 13: The Board Game is considered a Season, played over a series of Episodes. Each Episode will involve the investigation and retrieval of one artifact. Warehouse Agents must investigate clues, then use those clues to retrieve the artifact. However, one player is the Traitor, who secretly works for the Adversary. For every artifact that is lost, the Adversary becomes more powerful and thereby more difficult to defeat.&#10;&#10;Each Episode begins with the Ping Phase, in which the artifact's location is revealed and clue dice are rolled. Clues are represented by 13 custom six-sided dice.&#10;&#10;After the Ping Phase, the Investigation Phase begins. During the Adversary turn, the Adversary will act. Afterwards, each Agent must perform an Action, such as drawing Traits, playing a Trait, performing Warehouse Maintenance, or traveling to the Field. Next, each Agent must attempt to claim a clue die. If an Agent cannot claim a clue die, one must be neutralized, removing it from play for the remainder of that Episode. Finally, each Agent must draw a free Trait.&#10;&#10;The Investigation Phase repeats until all of the clue dice are either claimed or neutralized, then the Retrieval Phase begins. Each artifact displays symbols that correspond to the symbols on the clue dice. During each round of the Retrieval Phase, the players secretly roll all of their clue dice and each player chooses one to apply to the artifact. The chosen dice are revealed simultaneously. The Adversary will intervene by rolling Goo dice which can neutralize clue dice. If enough clues are applied to match the artifact's symbols, the artifact is retrieved. If the Agents run out of clue dice before rolling enough symbols, the artifact is lost to the Adversary.&#10;&#10;Play then continues to the next Episode. After three artifacts are retrieved, the Warehouse Agents win. However, if three artifacts are lost, the Finale begins, in which the Agents have one last chance to thwart the Adversary's grand scheme.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, the Traitor is hidden. The Traitor can impact the game by failing to assist the Warehouse Agents, by failing to claim clues, or by failing to apply clues properly. If the Agents believe they have determined who the Traitor is, they can vote to Bronze that player, which reveals their Loyalty.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "After years of jungle fighting and island hopping the battle for Manila was the first urban fighting experienced by American forces during the war in the Pacific.  The campaign by the American XIV Corps to defeat Iwabuchi&rsquo;s forces and capture the city has been depicted in a handful of two-player designs in the past but is presented here in a new and exciting SOLITAIRE format, the second in a series of single-player area movement games by publisher Take Aim Designs.&#10;&#10;Manila: The Savage Streets, 1945&nbsp;puts the player in charge of the attacking and far more mobile American side while the game system handles the defending and largely static Japanese side. No two games will ever be the same. Each turn presents new and unique challenges for the player in the form of random events, uncertain supply deliveries, and unknown Japanese area strengths and defensive strategies.&#10;&#10;The primary game is a nine-turn campaign covering the American assault on the city during February and March 1945. The deeper American forces advance, from the city&rsquo;s less developed periphery to its urban business district and fortress-like government buildings, the greater Japanese resistance becomes. The number of American units fought to exhaustion, effectively out of action, mounts. American determination to secure a rapid victory for Supreme Allied Commander General Douglas MacArthur, represented as &ldquo;morale&rdquo; in the game, gradually decreases. The player wins by equaling or exceeding historical American gains and loses if they fail to do so, or if morale falls too low.&#10;&#10;With a setup time of less than 15 minutes, low counter density, endless variability, and quick playing time, Manila: The Savage Streets, 1945&nbsp;will appeal to every level of player, from the novice to the grognard.&#10;&#10;Few battles at the end of the Second World War exceeded the destruction and brutality of the fighting in the city of Manila. MacArthur had hoped to spare the multicultural city and its roughly 800,000 inhabitants from the horrors of war, but failed. The fate of the city of Manila, the &quot;Pearl of the Orient,&rdquo; now rests with you.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Trial of Strength: War on the Eastern Front 1941-45 is an Eastern front strategic game set during World War 2, designed by Dave O'Connor.  Trial of Strength is a strategic level board wargame set in the Eastern Front of WWII, originally published by Panther Games in 1985.  A new second edition is being published by Lock 'n Load Publishing, LLC. (cancelled)&#10;&#10;Trial of Strength: War on the Eastern Front 1941-45 is a turn-based board wargame that puts the players in the shoes of armed forces commanders who must determine objectives, allocate forces and execute operations designed to achieve victory over your opponent.  The battlefield the game is played on is a hexagon-style 1:4,000,000 scale map of Eastern Europe with each hex represents 72 kilometres (45 miles) from side to side.  Each turn represents approximately 10 days, with 3 turns per month. Units are generally corps of the Axis and armies for the Soviet Union, both about 60,000 troops each, while also consisting of smaller battle groups of specialist formations.&#10;&#10;Trial of Strength: War on the Eastern Front 1941-45 heart comes from it's novel and sophisticated integrated movement and combat system called CLIMACS, units conduct combat during the movement phase by expending movement points.  The game is played at Corps / Army scale. There isn't a combat phase in Trial of Strength: War on the Eastern Front 1941-45.  All combat is done somewhat like overruns in the operations phase. A unit in range of a HQ  can roll for initiative to react when a combat is declared. Each HQ gets to do this once during the opponent's turn.&#10;&#10;The air and naval aspect of the game is easy.  There are Armor effects in combat and rules to allow more than one stack at a time to combine their movement. When Armor effects are used the Tanks must take the first loss if any (you will see the way those Panzers get worn down in Barbarossa). Losses are by step with possible retreats and even morale rolls to hold your ground and take more losses instead of retreating.  There is also limited intelligence with many units off the map (Army / Front markers). You can only see the top unit in a stack.&#10;&#10;Trial of Strength: War on the Eastern Front 1941-45 employs a special rule-set for the use of airborne, marine, mountain, artillery, rail-gun, rail construction NKVD and SS units.  The presence of an integrated political system into the game-play caters for historical events such as the reticence of Finland and the uprising of the Slovaks among others. While variable progress on the Western Front through the effects of Allied bombings and Partisans poses variable conditions for players.&#10;&#10;",

Islebound: Emerald Edition Upgrade Pack was available for owners of the original edition. The metal coins and painted wooden ships were also available separately, Islebound: Emerald Edition Deluxe Components.&#10;&#10;This edition of Islebound removes the book resource from the original game and replaces it with emeralds. Emeralds have different uses than books. You collect them when visiting a player-owned town and when you take over a town. Emeralds must be used to buy building cards, and they can also be used to perform special abilities, such as keeping pirates and serpents after combat! The building deck is revised to account for this resource change. It includes altered building cards from both the original game and some from the Metropolis expansion. There will not be a building card expansion for Islebound: Emerald Edition, and the Metropolis expansion is not compatible with this version.&#10;&#10;The backs of the crew tiles can be used in Above and Below.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Star Clicker is the new cooperative game of Christophe Raimbault - author of Colt Express - in which players are kids trying to save their planet from evil aliens while their parents are in mission far far away.&#10;&ldquo;Easy, we&rsquo;ve seen our parents do it so many times!&quot;&#10;&quot;Let&rsquo;s click on that button...&rdquo;&#10;&ldquo;Oups, sorry for the missile in your ship bro...&rdquo;&#10;&#10;How to play?&#10;Starclicker is a cooperative game in which you embody a pilot kid trying to save its planet from an Alien attack. At your turn, click and reveal one of the 9 buttons from your Spaceship Dashboard and do its action: move forward one tile, shoot, make a quarter turn or joker (choose among the 3 actions). When three of the buttons of the same zone are revealed, hide them. When you shoot a friend, shuffle the three buttons of the colour of the shot. When you shoot an alien ship, remove it from the board. When you land on a new tile, flip it to reveal its hidden face. There can be nothing, a meteorite or a satellite. When an alien ship reaches the planet, it damages its shield. Once there is no shield left the next damage is the last one and game is over. You and your team win when all the communication satellites have been repaired and before the mothership is empty or planet destroyed.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "In Iberian Railways, you start with nothing but hope and a willingness to take on debt in order to construct railways that connect towns and cities across the Iberian peninsula.&#10;&#10;The game board depicts Spain and Portugal, with towns, &quot;minor&quot; cities, &quot;major&quot; cities, Lisbon, and Madrid (collectively called &quot;urban hexes&quot;) being color-coded on a hex-based map. The board includes four action spaces &mdash; start, expand, merge, purchase &mdash; with all players starting on expand. On a turn, you must move your action marker to a new action, then either take that action or pass. The actions in brief:&#10;&#10;&bull; Start a new railway: Place cubes on the map to connect at least two urban hexes, increasing your income $1-6 for each urban hex that you connect to. All hexes outside of Madrid can have at most two cubes on them. Players can place at most three cubes at the start of the game, with this limit increasing by one after each build to a maximum of eight. Placing cubes costs $3-52 to place 1-8 cubes, with additional costs for building in river and hill hexes and a hex where someone else is already located &mdash; but you start with no money, so if you have no cash on hand, you must take loans (each worth $5) to cover these costs.&#10;&#10;&bull; Expand a railway: Connect one or more urban hexes to one of your existing railways, paying costs based on the number of cubes you place, taking loans if needed, then gaining income based on what you connect to.&#10;&#10;&bull; Merge two or more of your railways: Place one or more cubes to combine one or more of your railways into a single railway, then increase your income by $1 (or possibly more if you've placed cubes on new urban hexes as part of the merger).&#10;&#10;&bull; Purchase a business interest: Spend $3-5 to acquire an available business interest card. All of the minor and major cities, along with Lisbon, have one, and if you build a railway into this urban hex (or have already done so), flip this card face down, then add the cost of the card to your income.&#10;&#10;After you complete an action or pass, you receive your current income from the bank, pay interest on your loans (taking additional loans if needed), optionally pay off one of your loans for $6, then see whether the game ends because you've placed your final cube on the game board. Once the game ends, points are awarded for certain categories of growth, with each player being awarded in case of a tie. Whoever has the most cash on hand receives 2 points, and 1 point is awarded for each of the following: highest income, longest continuous run of track, most business interests, most towns in overall network, most minor cities in overall network, and most major cities in overall network. Whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

Usually this ritual took only seconds before the crystal power kicked in. Not today &hellip; it took him minutes to obtain the desired power required to load his wand for the adventurous travel ahead of him. While waiting for the blessing of the crystal power he noticed something dark. Something was lurking in the mist absorbing the essential and much needed crystal power from the crystal fragments orbiting around their world, Amanaar. In light of the immense threat to their habitat, Orly decided to set off on a journey, visiting some of the remarkable creatures of Amanaar in order to seek out the dark power that threatens their very lives. Never in his humble existence would he have imagined that some of his friends would turn against him in a battle for the Lost Lights of Amanaar ...&#10;&#10;THE GAME&#10;&#10;In Lost Lights, two players battle with their party of diverse animalistic characters for control over the Regions of Amanaar. In the beginning each player drafts 10 out of 27 beautifully and individually illustrated cards. On your turn you play a card from your hand and take a number of actions equal to the action point value on the card.&#10;&#10;Actions allow you to reinforce your party with new followers or to move your followers between the Areas on the map. In Areas where both parties meet, you&rsquo;ll battle each other. To resolve battles both of you secretly choose one character card from your hand as a leader in this battle, using their special ability. After the special abilities are resolved, your combined battle strength is added up. If you lose the battle, remove your party from the contested area. If you win you are now the dominant force in that area.&#10;&#10;The game ends immediately if one of you has no party members left on the map or if both of you run out of cards. When the game ends you add up your scores for each Area. Whoever achieved the higher score wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "It is August 31, 1940. For several weeks now, an air battle between Great Britain and the Third Reich has been in progress. This period will go down in history as the Battle of Britain. A message arrives at the operations room of the 11 Fighter Group command that numerous formations of German aircraft are flying in the direction of the capital. Yesterday, a Polish 303 Squadron pilot out on a training flight shot down a German bomber. Consequently, the RAF command, which has practically no more reserves, has decided to send this Polish unit into combat. Eager to fight, the pilots have been waiting impatiently for this order. Right now they are heading for a confrontation with the German air force. At last they have an opportunity to encounter the Luftwaffe on an equal footing and avenge the defeat suffered by Poland a year ago.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;303&rdquo; is a simple war board game for two. One of the players is the commander of the allied forces defending Great Britain while the other commands the attacking German Luftwaffe. Each player has access to six different kinds of planes and conducts aerial duels by using special dice. &#10;The mission of the Third Reich&rsquo;s air force is to bomb London. RAF&rsquo;s mission is to shoot down the bomber. Will the pilots of the 303 Squadron stop the air raid and save the capital?&#10;&#10;",

The latter achieves a very high income if it travels all the way from the Netherlands to Frankfurt or Basel.&#10;&#10;18Rhl-Rhineland is a revision of 1838: Rheinland.&#10;&#10;Players buy companies and stock in railroads in a effort to make more money than the other players.

Set in the 30s-40s, the families have to fight for the control of their businesses (arms trade, prostitution, illegal gambling...), spread around NYC's five neighborhoods (Queens, Manhattan, Bronx, Staten Island and Brooklyn). Each family has a main goal to achieve during the game, and several secondary objectives that can make the family improve.&#10;&#10;By means of money and respect points, each family can increase its members (gangsters, soldiers), who will help control the domains and businesses their family owns.&#10;&#10;Strategic balance between defense of one's possessions and the conquest of new domains will be key to the game, but chance will also take part in it, as attacks, defense movements and several other actions required by many event cards will make us throw the dice.&#10;&#10;The final goal of the game is to fulfill the requirements set in a main goal card given out at the beginning of the game, and achieving in addition as many secondary objectives as possible, which will bring us additional respect points.&#10;&#10;Original Spanish description:&#10;Omert&agrave;, el poder de la mafia, es un juego de cartas altamente estrat&eacute;gico, en el que cada jugador gu&iacute;a los designios de una de las cinco familias mafiosas de Nueva York.

Players combine dice to target and remove zombies from an ever-advancing horde before their barricade is overrun.&#10;&#10;The game is suitable for all ages and abilities, and can be played in as little as 15 minutes (in the shorter version). The key game mechanics involve manipulating the numbers rolled on the dice via combinations of mathematical functions (from basic addition and subtraction through to squaring and cube rooting) to hit the exact numbers on the encroaching zombie cards - you need a precise head shot to take them out! As a co-op game, the difficulty can be tailored to suit the skills of the players, and supports groups of mixed abilities well.&#10;&#10;Originally developed to assist the designer's daughter with her maths, the game has fantastic learning potential for players. It offers number manipulation skills by stealth rather than in a more traditional overtly &quot;educational&quot; game setting. What was designed with educational intent has become a great game for gamers and their families, and suits more experienced groups as a good warm-up or end of night filler.&#10;&#10;",

Players also attempt to capture Towers in order to level up experience (which enables the player to roll better dice), to re-spawn dead minions from the graveyard, and to &quot;purchase&quot; the services of the various Overlords.

    "description": "The Tuesday Club Murders (El Club de los Martes) is formed when the host, is entertaining friends and they decide that each should tell a story of a mystery, without revealing the answer, so that the others can try to guess the outcome. It is felt that with their combined skills and variety of individual experience, they will be able to solve the problems presented. The players try to reconstruct the crime by asking, guessing and fiddling about.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;=======How would it be if we formed a Club? What is today ? Tuesday? We will call it The Tuesday Night Club. It is to meet every week, and each member in turn has to propound a problem. Some mystery of which they have personal knowledge, and to which, of course, they know the answer. Let me see, how many are we? One, two, three, four, five. We ought really to be six... (Joyce Lempri&eacute;re)&#10;&#10;From this conversation in Agatha Christie&rsquo;s book &lsquo;The Tuesday Club Murders&rsquo;, a series of great detective stories come up, where perceptive characters rival Miss Marple, who teachs them a real lesson of shrewdness, explaining with talent and with all kind of misteries, no matter how strange or complicated they may be.&#10;&#10;This game is exactly that: a narrative game based on the classic detective stories. A group of five players cooperate and compete to solve a mistery proposed by a sixth player, known as the host, trying to emulate Sherlock Holmes himself, from Arthur Conan Doyle&rsquo;s books. Host and players find themselves entwined in a complicated game of cat and mouse, where the first one propose a mysterious enigma and the others must solve it by racking their brains. For a length of an hour, as that is the time limit to solve the mistery, an intense (intellectual) battle is fought, where the host challenges the rest of the members of the Tuesday Club to find a solution that almost never is near or within reach. The armchair detectives will have to use in a creative way the clich&eacute;s with which their dramatic characters have been defined, and they will have to make the appropriate questions in order to find the solution.&#10;&#10;Therefore, this is a game that puts the perceptiveness, intuition, and above all the logical and deductive intelligence of the participants to test. The constant interactivity among the players, the creation of intelligent questions with shrewdness, wit and creativity, and the dynamism of the intrigue make &lsquo;El Club de los Martes&rsquo; a perfect game to spend an hour of fun with family or friends.&#10;&#10;El Club de los Martes is many games in one.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;=======A narrative game of deduction and logic. All players are armchair detectives meeting every Tuesday to engage on some crime solving. A host presents the case and in turns each player can ask questions and use his or her special abilities to gather more information. Asking questions and gathering information cost money -every player starts the game with 15 pounds - paid to a common pool. Proposing a solution is very expensive and other players may benefit economically from you failures. Only one player may win, but the solution relies on the information gathered by the whole group with certain cooperatives aspects. If no detective solves the crime after one hour, nobody wins. The player with the &ldquo;first player&rdquo; token has the advantage because she starts every round; but if that player passes, she loses the token that goes to the next player.&#10;&#10;Based in novel &quot;The Tuesday Club Murders&quot; by Agatha Christie.&#10;&#10;Rules one are available in Spanish language.&#10;&#10;",

The selection of a small scenario allows the novice to play within an hour of opening the box, with several scenarios also being optimal for solitaire play.&#10;&#10;Rules come punched for a three ringed binder (not provided) for ease of use and photocopying. They follow the same format as our other rules used in the Trilogy, making them easy to follow for experienced gamers, and novices alike. Tactical turns represent 3 minutes, with intermediate turns (for long distance maneuvering and long stern chases) representing 30 minutes. Gun hit probability is based upon a combination of factors such as visibility, range, target size, number of rounds firing at the target, and speeds of the firing and target platforms. Damage is a function of the type of shell, number of barrels firing and armor of target, and is easy to calculate also. Blank ship forms allow the player to list all the ranges and damages of his ship's particular guns in advance, making it quick and easy to calculate both damage and hit probability. Critical damage is a function of the amount of damage taken last round vs. the amount of damage able to be taken. Critical hits typically scored against systems (engineering, bridge, steering or individual weapon amounts).&#10;&#10;The 40+ scenarios include the well known &quot;biggies&quot; such as Jutland (broken into three parts, as well as the grand battle) and Dogger Bank, and many smaller engagements. Often there are variants given, covering important &quot;almosts&quot; and &quot;what ifs&quot;. All aspects are covered, with ships provided for the Japanese, Turkish, Austrian, and Russian navies as well as the British and German fleets. The Data Annex includes all ship classes for the war and is a valuable reference by itself. So with this product, one need only Fear God &amp; Dread Nought!&#10;&#10;",

This theft, simply committed by greed, threatens to plunge the city into an era of plagues and cataclysms. Of course, you are not irreproachable on this ground .. As a bounty hunter, each contract is valid if it is lucrative. Also, do you agree to hunt down these looters!&#10;&#10;Immerse yourself in a medieval Asian universe and play the heroine to find the three criminals.&#10;&#10;Tears of a Goddess, a.k.a. Nuwa's Tears, is a comic combined with a game, one title in a series subtitled &quot;The comic in which you are the hero&quot;. You embody a character in a immersive story in which your choices guide your progress. You have a character sheet akin to those used in role-playing games that tracks your possessions, your special abilities, your coins, and your victory points. In general, gameplay consists in following the comic's panels &mdash; which contain clues, riddles and traps &mdash; and making choices about where to go and what to do, while using your visual perception to collect clues and be smart enough to resolve the riddles. As in any game, you can lose &mdash; sometimes really badly!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Race to get Kion to the top of pride rock so he can unleash the power of the Roar and save the day!&#10;&#10;Protect the Pride Lands is a cooperative family board game based on the Disney Junior show &quot;The Lion Guard&quot;.  It includes four high quality hero miniatures, 15 unique &quot;outlander&quot; standees and is played on a board with 3-D features.  Outlanders (hyenas, snakes and vultures) invade the Pride Lands from different locations while the Lion Guard heroes race to remove them from the board.&#10;&#10;Each turn, a player draws from the deck and adds an outlander creature to the board as pictured in the top half of the card.  Then a choice is given to the player to move one of two heroes, as shown on the bottom half of the card, up to a number of spaces listed. If a hero lands on a space with an outlander, the outlander is removed from the board.  There are also &quot;Power Cards&quot; that provide a bonus effect, such as removing any one outlander from the board.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to move Kion to the top of &quot;Pride Rock&quot; before the outlanders get to their winning space.  Otherwise the Pride Lands have been invaded and the players lose.&#10;&#10;",
