Players now assign the dice to the pawns and try to determine the highest score possible. The player announcing the highest number before the timer runs out performs his move. &#10;Each pawn moves, in clockwise order, the number of spaces shown on it assigned die and scores 1 point for each pawn on the space it ends its move.

(They never actually get the snack, due to the wily fish just below the surface, but it doesn't dissuade them from trying!) Passersby watch the scene for a moment, then smile, charmed by these four people idling away their time. Little do they realize that these crafty individuals actually have a standing wager: Each has chosen a color of duck in the pond as his own, and whoever can gather his ducks into a group first gets to choose the adventure for the day!&#10;&#10;Feed the ducks is a board game for two to four players. Each game lasts about 20 minutes. Players drop breadcrumbs into the pond, in order to attract the ducks. There are ducks in 4 colors. The first player to coerce all the ducks of his color into a single group wins.&#10;&#10;The basic set includes components for a 2-player game. In order to play 3- or 4-player games you need the additional ducks and counters (red and blue).&#10;&#10;MATERIAL&#10;&#10;This is what you need in order to play Feed the ducks:&#10;&#10;- A board depicting a pond with 61 hexagonal spaces.&#10;&#10;- 12 white ducks, 12 black ducks (plus 8 red ducks and 6 blue ducks optionally).&#10;&#10;- A breadcrumb (not included)&#10;&#10;- One white counter, one black counter (plus one red counter and one blue counter optionally).&#10;&#10;- A carrying case.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Trike is a combinatorial abstract strategy game for two players. The game revolves around setting traps, dismantling opponent traps, and maneuvering a shared piece into your own trap to win.&#10;&#10;Trike has high clarity due to the simple movement protocol, singular win condition, low branching factor, and easy-to-read board state. However, Trike is dramatic because it offers players many chances to make fatal errors.&#10;&#10;Rules: Play on an equilateral triangular hexagon-tessellated grid. Use a neutral pawn and black/white checkers. Players take turns moving a neutral pawn around on the board (passing is not allowed). The neutral pawn can move any number of empty points, in any direction in a straight line, but cannot move onto, or jump over occupied points. When a player moves the pawn, first they place a checker of their own color, onto the destination point. Then they move the pawn on top of it. When the pawn is trapped, the game is over. At the end of the game, each player gets a point for each checker of their own color adjacent to, or underneath, the pawn. The person with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;Implement pie rule. This means, at the beginning of the game, the first player chooses a color and puts a checker on any point of the board, with the pawn on top of it. At this time only, the second player has a one-time chance to swap sides instead of making a regular move.&#10;&#10;Trike is partisan, draw-less, finite, cycle-free, always decisive, scalable with board size, and balanced with the pie rule.&#10;&#10;One note on gameplay: the score will always include one point for the last move, and one point for the second-to-last move. Therefore, who plays last has no bearing on who wins the game.&#10;&#10;The game can be played on boards with side length 7 up to 19. However, the smaller sizes (7-10) are meant for those just learning, while sizes 13-15 are standard for serious competitive play.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Mount Tai is of key importance in Chinese religion, being the eastern one of the five Sacred Mountains of China. According to historical records, Mount Tai became a sacred place visited by emperors to offer sacrifices and meditate in the Zhou Dynasty before 1,000 BC. A total of 72 emperors were recorded as visiting it. Writers also came to acquire inspiration, to compose poems, write essays, paint and take pictures. Hence, a great many cultural relics were left on the mountain. During the reign of Liu Che, Emperor Wu of Han, the Emperor has visited Mount Tai 8 times, praising the deities associated to this mountain. In 90 BC, the elderly aged Emperor spent most of the national strength on military operations, and his crown prince died because of his paranoia, leaving the court and the royal family in a mess. Liu Guang, the King Lu&rsquo;an and nephew of the Emperor, was incurably sick. He decided to allocate the administration of Mount Tai to his sons, hoping to train their abilities of governing.

    "description": "From the back of the box...&#10;&#10;Early in 1862, a little known General named U.S. Grant overran West Tennessee, taking two river forts and the largest bag of prisoners captured up to that time by an American army.  But as the Union troops advanced on Corinth, the Confederates hit back, staking everything on a furious battle in the woods around Shiloh Church.&#10;GRANT MOVES SOUTH puts you in command of the Tennessee campaign.  As General Grant, you must combine river and overland movement to strike deep into rebel territory against the important points of Nashville, Corinth, Memphis, and Columbus.  As the Confederate General, A.S. Johnston, you must use careful maneuver and counterattacks to prevent the ever-growing torrent of Bluecoats from conquering Tennessee.&#10;&#10;GRANT MOVES SOUTH shows the critical importance of the road net, water movement and the abilities of individual division commanders.  The fog of war is thick as you know where the enemy is, but not how strong he is.  Gunboats attack river forts, and steamers whisk troops deep into enemy territory.&#10;&#10;",

When you hatch, you notice that your egg was different than the other eggs. But this is your nest, right? So, you want to throw them out. Looking around, you notice another cuckoo. Your competitor! Will you manage to get rid of all other eggs or lure your competitor into a trap? Start the battle.&#10;&#10;You take alternating turns, with the starting player going first. Your turn consists of moving one game piece on the board, your turn ends after the movement. There are three different game pieces, each with their own rules for movement.&#10;&#10;Game pieces can only move to a space on the board that is empty or occupied by an opponent. Game pieces cannot jump over other game pieces. When you move a game piece to an occupied space, you capture your opponent on this space. Your opponents&rsquo; game piece is then removed from the board and your game piece takes its place. There are two basic rules to keep in mind; 1) if you can capture an opponent, you are obliged to. 2) You can only move your game pieces in a forward direction, except when you can capture an opponent behind you.&#10;&#10;Your movement options lead to two potential situations; 1) you can capture an opponent, or 2) you cannot capture an opponent.&#10;&#10;There are four winning conditions in this battle. 1) All game pieces of your own color are captured, except your own cuckoo. 2) You capture your opponents&rsquo; cuckoo. 3) You enter one of the homebases of your opponent with your own cuckoo, thereby taking over their nest. 4) Your opponent enters one of your homebases with any game piece other than their cuckoo, this game piece is now safe from being captured.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

When they are hit by an attack greater than their protection they are removed from the game.&#10;&#10;On their turn, the players have three actions they can spend to move their team or to attack. By killing bosses, cheerleaders can obtain special actions, while zombies can do the same by destroying the barricades.&#10;&#10;The game uses illustrations made specially for the game by the design team of the comic book series &quot;Zombies vs Cheerleaders&quot;.&#10;&#10;",

The first consonant may not be used by the players in their word but the other consonants may be used and are assigned values of one, two or three. The topic is read aloud and the players must think up a word that fits the topic and uses any or all of the permissible consonants but not the forbidden consonant. The first to think up a word announces it and totals its value. The other players then secretly decide whether anyone else can come up with a higher scoring word. Once the players have voted anyone who thinks a higher scoring can been generated has an additional twenty seconds (a sand timer is included) to announce that word. Points are scored based on who came up with the round's winning word and who voted correctly.&#10;&#10;The final round of the game has the players deciding which of two teams to join secretly. The player who comes up with the highest scoring word on each team scores the most points.&#10;&#10;The player with the most points at the end of the game is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

The bigger the city, the more prestige points it can provide.&#10;Players have two optional actions in a turn: to buy resources on the market and to expand Monopolis by adding a new building tile. They can do both in any order, or the same action twice. There are specific resource requirements for inserting a new building tile. These are shown on collectible demand tokens of various colors, placed randomly to the edges of the tiles already on the board. Players can build a desired building by spending the necessary resources and placing their house on the new tile. The houses are stored on their personal board, and when removed, immediate bonuses become available.&#10;There are 5 types of building tiles, some cheaper, others more expensive to build, and the benefits and victory points they provide differ accordingly. Residential areas and parks are the easiest to implement, while business districts will have a positive impact on the value of adjacent areas and vice versa. Public functions require higher investment but they give bonuses and other benefits, and some institutions provide more prestige points.&#10;The city of Monopolis spans an area of up to 7x7 tiles. The game ends with the round when one of the players runs out of houses. The end-game scores are based on the values of the tiles built and the sets of icons collected, but additional points can be earned in a number of ways.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)&#10;&#10;K&ouml;nnyed, csal&aacute;di j&aacute;t&eacute;k, amelyben 2-4 j&aacute;t&eacute;kos egyetlen k&ouml;z&ouml;s v&aacute;rost &eacute;p&iacute;t  &ndash; preszt&iacute;zspontok&eacute;rt versenyezve.

One round is composed of the two actions of placing one of the twelve polycubes and a balance stone within the confines of the 8 square-gridded base. The cubes of the positioned polycubes dictate the points awarded.&#10;&#10;If a player's tower topples, they lose the game. The game ends when a player's tower topples over or if all the available polycubes have been placed.

Since the raw materials were no longer available to make Ancient Construct, the designer revised the game, introducing a strategic element and expanding play to six players.&#10;&#10;Publisher's summary&#10;&#227;&#131;&#157;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#173;&#227;&#131;&#165;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#150;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#133;&#153;&#231;&#170;&#129;&#231;&#138;&#182;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#161;&#148;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#187;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#156;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#228;&#184;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#233;&#133;&#141;&#231;&#189;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#231;&#171;&#139;&#228;&#189;&#147;&#231;&#169;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#191;&#228;&#184;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#146;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;1&#230;&#137;&#139;&#231;&#149;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#131;&#157;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#173;&#227;&#131;&#165;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#150;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#131;&#144;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#231;&#159;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#189;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#143;2&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#183;&#227;&#131;&#167;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#230;&#167;&#139;&#230;&#136;&#144;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#233;&#133;&#141;&#231;&#189;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#131;&#157;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#173;&#227;&#131;&#165;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#150;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#173;&#227;&#131;&#165;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#150;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#190;&#151;&#231;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#233;&#128;&#148;&#228;&#184;&#173;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#229;&#161;&#148;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#128;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#232;&#178;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#229;&#161;&#148;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#128;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#230;&#153;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#229;&#133;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#157;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#173;&#227;&#131;&#165;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#150;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#233;&#133;&#141;&#231;&#189;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#230;&#153;&#130;&#231;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#130;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#144;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#130;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#144;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#230;&#153;&#130;&#231;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#231;&#149;&#170;&#229;&#190;&#151;&#231;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#233;&#171;&#152;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "A member of the Checkers Family very popular in Brasil.&#10;&#10;Brazilian Checkers or Draughts is played under the same basic rules that apply to International Checkers except that it is played on a smaller 8 x 8, or 64-square board with each player playing 12 pieces.&#10;&#10;This variant is started by the player who either wins a random toss of a coin or the player who plays the light colored pieces. Then the players alternately make their moves thereafter.&#10;&#10;Rules of the Game: This checkers variation is played using an 8 x 8, or 64 squares checker board of light and dark squares and each player has 12 pieces of contrasting colors, usually red and white. The board is placed between the two players in such a way that the double corner is on the right side and a dark colored square is on the left side of each player. The player places his pieces on the first three rows on his side of the board&#10;&#10;The Moves of the Men: Checker players can only move their pieces forward one at a time on each empty square to the left or to the right. If a player successfully moves his pieces to the last, or &quot;king row,&quot; then that piece must be crowned &quot;king&quot; by the opponent by placing a second checker on top of the crowned piece.&#10;&#10;The Moves of the King: King pieces are &quot;flying kings,&quot; which means that they can move over many empty squares on the diagonal lines that pass over the square on which they are located.&#10;&#10;Captures: In Brazilian Checkers captures are mandatory. And, maximum captures are compulsory as well, which means that if a player has more than one way to capture the opposing pieces then he must choose that way that will result in the capture of the most number of pieces. If a checker piece reaches the king row while in a capture sequence, it must keep on capturing pieces backward for as long as there still pieces to capture. That capturing piece cannot be crowned king unless it finishes the move and stops on king row.&#10;&#10;Captures by the Men: Men can capture by jumping forward or backward over a single piece that is located next to it only if the square located next to the captured piece is unoccupied. If the man can jump again from its landing square to make another capture, then it must do so because all captures are mandatory.&#10;&#10;Captures by a King: A crowned piece can capture an opponent's piece forward and backward diagonally if it is on the same path where it is located and if the squares between them are unoccupied and that if the square immediately after the piece that will be captured is also unoccupied. The crowned piece can land on any empty square within the same path and if a continuous capture is possible, then the player must keep on capturing even if this move will not redound to the best interest of the player making the capture.&#10;&#10;The Winning Player: A player wins the game if he has captured all of his opponent's pieces or successfully blocked his opponent's pieces such that the opponent is unable to move any of his pieces.&#10;&#10;Conditions for a Draw: The players can mutually agree to a draw. A draw may also happen if the same position has occurred three times during the game, or if there are three crowned pieces playing against one and that both players have made 16 moves without attaining any promotion or making a capture.&#10;&#10;Information from checkershistory.com&#10;&#10;",

To set up the simmering cauldrons at the start of the game, you place the top six cards of the deck into three columns of two cards. The special actions consist of jokers and enchantments, and two of these cards are placed face-up; a joker can replace any ingredient, while an enchantment allows you to:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Select one ingredient of your choice &#10;     Switch up to five ingredients of the same color with an opponent&#10;     Steal one ingredient from the cauldron &#10;     Discard up to five ingredients&#10;&#10;&#10;During your turn, you take one of three actions:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Add ingredients: Place one ingredient in each cauldron, after which if each cauldron has two ingredients of the same color or value, you can take one ingredient from any cauldron.&#10;     Taste a potion: Take all the ingredients of the same color or value from one cauldron.&#10;     Cast a spell: Discard the proper mix of ingredients in order to cast a spell. The big Megalos, for example, is composed of nine ingredients of a single color and is so rare that casting it allows you to win the game instantly. The Pentos requires five different ingredients of the same value, and casting it ends the current round. The Mikkros, composed of three ingredients of the same value or three of the same ingredient in consecutive values, allows you to take two special action cards.&#10;&#10;&#10;When a player casts a Pentos or the ingredient deck runs out, the round ends, although players with ingredients in hand can still play card suits of the same color. Each ingredient in a suit earns you 1 Ko&acirc;, while an isolated ingredient is worth its value in Ko&acirc;s.&#10;&#10;After three rounds or a Megalos spell, the game ends. In the latter case, the Megalos-casting player wins; in the latter, the player with the most Ko&acirc;s is immediately turned into a toad.&#10;&#10;",

Bivouac also comes with an expansion that includes activity upgrades and staff member cards that assist in a player's quest to become the best. The player with the most victory points at the end of 13 rounds is the winner.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

However, the order from left to right and front to back should be kept. Thus, reading from left to right, the goal position is one through five suns (tenth rank), one through five moons (ninth rank) and one through five stars (eighth rank). The player first achieving this position wins by as many points as the number of moves opponent would need to achieve his goal position.&#10;&#10;If neither player reaches the goal position by the time 120 moves have been made by each player, the score is calculated as the difference between the number of moves each player would need to reach the goal position, as if the board were clear of opposing pieces.&#10;&#10;",

Your brave warrior must search far and wide for these ferocious beasts, defend yourself against its attacks and be ever ready to strike them down. Even in victory your companions may challenge your courage, demanding that you prove your valor with foolhardy audacity or cower in their mocking taunts.&#10;&#10;Dragon Slayer is a new push-your-luck game that's a deceptively difficult challenge. Like all great PYL games, the rules are simple, with you repeating the Dragon Hunt until you decide to stop. The very interesting twist is the player challenges. The ability to challenge &mdash; and rewards for passing or failing when challenged &mdash; add a dimension to everything that you do on your turn. What order do you go after dragons? When do you stop? When do you challenge? Who do you challenge? How do you get others not to challenge you?!&#10;&#10;",

If this approach will help new players to discover RPGs in a comforting and amusing way, it will fulfill the grognards as well, with additional possibilities offered by a set of optional rules that convey an old-school dungeon-crawling feeling.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Game description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Gunship: First Strike! is Escape Pod Games' core release in a planned series of tactical space combat games. Players fight to win battles in a futuristic civil war with a variety of ship types. From the agile and speedy Fighters, to lethal Gunships and intimidating Capital Ships, every battle is a well-balanced slugfest that comes right down to the wire. Our new Trinity Mechanic uses boards, cards and dice together in an extremely innovative and easy-to-learn system that lets new players jump right in.&#10;&#10;What makes the Gunship series unique are the numerous combinations of ships that the players &quot;build&quot; at the start of each battle. By choosing from an ever-growing selection (through expansions) of available Weapons and Upgrades, players are able to create a custom Gunship that is suited to their particular style of play or battle situation. Some guys are &quot;defensive&quot; minded; they'll choose Heavy Armor, +1 Shield Generators and 4 Blaster Cannons to fend off the enemy Gunship. But another player might prefer to build a &quot;Carrier Killer&quot; complete with wings full of Bombs and an Autoblaster Cannon to shred his way through the enemy Fighter Squadron. While most of the Upgrade cards are geared toward the Gunships (the true star of the show) you can also do some great things to your Fighters and Capital Ships. New kinds of ships will come with every expansion to further add to the possibilities. No two battles are ever the same!&#10;&#10;In Gunship: First Strike!, the civil war has just started. Your orders are simple: Command a task force of one Assault Carrier and its Gunship and Fighters on a mission to destroy the enemy's Carrier. Guess what? He has the very same orders! Dogfights will ensue, Torpedoes will strike home and Thruster Bombs are going to pound the Capital Ships mercilessly. If your Gunship takes too much damage for comfort, or if the battle situation changes and you want a different weapon load, land inside your Carrier for a quick &quot;pit stop&quot;. Make sure that you defend it with all your might because once your Carrier is gone, the only option left to you is to flee the battlespace and hope to take revenge another day.&#10;&#10;As the Gunship universe grows, players will be able to fight bigger and bigger battles. Soon the objectives will include breaking through the enemy picket line to drop troops on the planet below. The Gunships will be called upon to not only assault other ships, but also to go dirtside and give air support to the land battle raging below  A free Campaign System is planned where players can keep track of a fleet of ships and territories. Lose your Carrier in today's battle and you might lose a critical Outpost next week. Don't let the enemy find the Shipyard where your damaged Destroyers limped home last time &ndash; if he does, they're toast!&#10;&#10;",

First, the effect of the swap card is applied, if possible. Then the total evidence is added up for every suspect.

    "description": "Be a market vendor in Bansan, a lively game inspired by the  multisensory experience of a bustling wet market in Penang. You'll need to &quot;bao ka liao&quot;&mdash;deal with fellow vendors, wholesalers, and customers; buy and sell ingredients; cook and serve hawker stall fare; keep the waste bins from overflowing; and navigate a myriad of events that changes up every game you play.&#10;&#10;Each player is a vendor renting market stalls while running a hawker food business in a bansan. On your turn, you will stock produce from the wholesale supply into market stalls, then take 2 actions from 3 options:&#10;&#10;&#10;     BUY produce from other vendors or your wholesaler&#10;     SELL produce to online customers&#10;     EMPTY a waste bin &#10;&#10;&#10;Just like in local Asian markets, bargain at anytime to negotiate the best deals from other vendors. Then complete shopping lists of ingredients to make a variety of hawker food for your customers. The vendor who has earned the most money at game end wins!&#10;&#10;There's also the Sendiri Mode - a solo way to play Bansan, and the Kenduri Mode - when the market gets a big order to host a feast!&#10;&#10;Juggle the multiple roles of a vendor to win the title of &quot;Bos Bansan!&quot; Even if you get out-vended, you are guaranteed a taste of the chaos and excitement of local market culture in Malaysia!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "HOOK: The movies Alien and Escape from Alcatraz meet 3-Card Monte meet the spin cycle of your washing machine!&#10;HOOK: Only the player with the best Plan B will Escape because Plan A never survives the MoonQuake!&#10;&#10;In MoonQuake Escape, get ready to face the challenges of the spinning, changing 3D surface of the doomed prison planet of Zartaclaton. A massive MoonQuake grants you sudden freedom from your captivity, but there's only one way to Escape--the last rescue rocket, and you need to reach it before the other players.  Use the rotating and revolving 3D moon to gather charges and decide which actions will best meet your goal: finding and stopping others players, readying or stealing key equipment, or finding better ways to hide.  Along the treacherous journey, watch out for shifting and dangerous terrain, out of control defenses, and a relentless prison guard that are out to end your sentence--for life!&#10;&#10;Finding and stopping the other players is your best plan, but each is hiding amongst decoys and traps.  Player interaction focuses on a risk fraught variation of the classic 3-card Monte combined with a thematic &quot;Bluffing&quot; component that completely reverses the &quot;Take That&quot; mechanic.
