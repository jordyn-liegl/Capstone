A player may overlap as often as they want, but at the end of the game, points are scored horizontally, vertically and diagonally in the grid. But don't get your precious jewels snatched away, when opponents attempt to sabotage you with their Gem Thief cards, which will surely keep you on high alert! Put your thinking cap on, stay cool and collected, and you'll be sure to win the game!&#10;&#10;Not to be confused with:&#10;&#10;        Stratagem (1998)&#10;        Stratagem (2014)&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "In Jailbreakers: Plan Your Escape you take the role of a group of prisoners plotting their escape. Carefully gather materials to create unique items that are needed to execute escape plans. Each item has a special ability which will help you along the way. But be careful as you collect items from rooms around the prison as the guards can catch you!&#10;&#10;Summary of play in six steps:&#10;&#10;Step 1: Roll and Place Prisoner Dice&#10;&#10;A player begins his turn by rolling a six sided die. Depending on the value rolled he must then place that die on a placement card that is less than or equal to that value. Since there can only be one die per placement there is a possibility that he will be unable to place his die due to another player being there or that space being patrolled by a guard, if that is the case he will temporarily lose that die.&#10;&#10;Step 2: Take Action on Placement Card&#10;&#10;After landing on a placement card the player then takes the action associated with that card. Some placements will allow you to collect materials while others let you steal from other players.&#10;&#10;Step 3: Use Material Cards to Craft Items&#10;&#10;Anytime during a players turn they may take two material cards to create a crafted item. Each crafted item has a special ability which helps throughout the game. Some crafted items will alter dice rolls while others make it easier to escape.&#10;&#10;Step 4: Gather the Items for an Escape Plan&#10;&#10;There will be a handful of escape plans that are available for everyone to utilize. Use the escape plans available as a guide on what combination of crafted items you should be creating. Once you have collected the required items needed (2-4 depending on the type of escape plan) you can execute that escape.&#10;&#10;Step 5: Execute an Escape Plan&#10;&#10;In order to successfully escape the player must draw the required success cards needed (Depending on the type of escape plan) one by one. This number is indicated on the escape plan. You may back out at any time but if you fail then you will lose all the items you used during that attempt.&#10;&#10;Step 6: Escape with Two Prisoners&#10;&#10;The first player to escape with two prisoners wins the game&#10;&#10;",

During the game set-up, six differently-colored crystals are hidden underneath six temples placed on the board. An additional eight crystals are laid out on the game board, with four types of golden treasures on display as well, one type in each corner. On a turn, the player rolls the die and gets one of two results:&#10;&#10;&bull; If the die shows one or two colors and the player has a crystal matching one of these colors, then she can move up to two spaces on the board. If she lacks a matching crystal, she picks up a temple and secretly looks inside: if the crystal inside the temple matches, she reveals it, moves her figure up to two spaces, then sets the temple down again, possibly in a new location; if the crystal doesn't match, she replaces the temple and doesn't move.&#10;&#10;&bull; If the die shows a mummy, the player moves her token up to three spaces and moves the mummy three spaces around the outer edge of the board. Any player caught by the mummy leaves a golden treasure (or a crystal if no treasure is held) in that space, then returns to start. The mummy and token movement can be done in either order.&#10;&#10;Land on a crystal or golden treasure that you don't have, and you can claim it. Collecting crystals helps you move more consistently, and collecting treasures is how you win the game. The rules include a few variants for mummy movement and crystal power.&#10;&#10;",

Deep in the Yucatan jungle, humanity has mutated, degenerated, and segregated into five clans: Jaguar, Snake, Monkey, Gar, and Bat. These clans now battle it out for dominance in the region, cooperating when it suits them and actively working against each other when the opportunity arises.&#10;&#10;In 3012, players start the game with small decks of Scout cards, which provide gold to make purchases. Two piles of cards &ndash; an Ally deck and a Weapon deck &ndash; provide static cards to buy, with three cards from each deck always available to purchase each round. Cards that are not bought remain there for other players to buy. Two non-static Action decks &ndash; one with cheap cards, the other expensive &ndash; are also available, and at the start of your turn, you reveal one card from each of these two Action decks. You get the benefits of the Action cards you reveal, whether you buy them or not, and they're removed from play if you don't buy them.&#10;&#10;When you have amassed enough combat skill through Allies, Weapons, and Action cards, you can attempt to prove your worth by facing a beast in four decks of Encounter cards, ranging from easy to very difficult.&#10;&#10;Unlike most deck-building games, there are many points of interaction in 3012, so players are never out of the action! And you always get to refill your hand to its maximum size at the start of your turn, so you are never penalized for interacting during other players' turns.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one of the Heroes reaches Level 5. The player with the most victory points wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

When a player has 2 or fewer cubes left, the game ends.&#10;Players draw a number of cubes from the pool of 50 coloured cubes (5 colours and numbered 0-9. The same number is displayed on all six faces of the die). This varies depending upon the number of players in the game.&#10;In turn, each player tries to place a higher valued pyramid on the board than the previous player. If a player is unable to do so, they pass their turn. Play continues with the next person able to place a higher value pyramid on the board unless it goes around to the last person who successfully place a pyramid. In this case, they may place a pyramid of any value. &#10;The board has inset spaces to take the cubes at an angle for stacking the number cubes. A player forms a pyramid by having using three dice on the same level to form a base. Add together the numbers on the bases of these three cubes. The cube placed on the apex of this pyramid must match the last digit of the sum of numbers on the bases. (example: the base is formed of the numbers 5,7,9. The sum is 21. The apex of the pyramid must be a 1). &#10;The value of pyramids played is similar to a poker hand and varies from High Value (different colours and values) to a 'Royal Straight Flush' (a 7,8,9,0 with a 7 at the apex of the same colour).&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Kamakura is a game of feudal Japanese warfare in which you attempt to defeat an opponent by taking their territories before they take yours; this is done by carefully choosing combinations of weapons, soldiers, and arrow barrages to attack with, while defending your own territories with a myriad of defensive techniques. Strategy, deception, and bravery will be your most valuable assets in the complex and varied game of Kamakura.&#10;&#10;The game features original artwork and game play.  The premise of the game is to capture all of your opponents territories OR gain a score of 17 or more. You combine various soldiers each with unique abilities with crafty weapons in order to take territories as your own. The mechanics behind the game are card management and general strategy.&#10;&#10;As of 2014 edition:&#10;&#10;Gameplay;&#10;We&rsquo;ve decided to introduce &ldquo;Clan Power&rdquo; cards. Each deck comes with 1 Clan Power card for each Clan, totaling 4 Clan Power cards per deck. Each Clan Power is unique, adding new strategic elements and depth. &#10;To compensate for adding the new Clan Power cards we took away 1 Naginata and 1 Yumi (the two most powerful weapons). The deck now totals 54 cards. &#10;Color coded backs have been added for easy sorting with their corresponding Clans.&#10;&#10;Updated Territories;&#10;Barrages and Walls now have point values. 1 barrage (Attack Power of 2) can take either the Farm or Village, but 2 barrages (total Attack Power of 4) are needed to take a Fortress or Palace. Walls now have a Defense Power of 2.&#10;Walls also have the ability to scout territories. For example, 1 Barrage can be played on a palace, if your opponent doesn&rsquo;t have a wall, they must still reveal the Territory, but it cannot be captured.&#10;Even though the Barrage now has an Attack Power, it still may NOT be used with a soldier.&#10;&#10;Refined Card UI;&#10;Along with enhanced card and box quality we wanted to address the card design and how they explained themselves. We rethought how to phrase the descriptions and abilities of every single card. This led us to add slight iconography to the cards to further help explain the context that each card may be used in. At the top right of the Abilities box is either a sword, shield, flag or a combination of sword and shield.&#10;&#10;For more info on the 2014 edition refer to the updates section of the Kickstarter for the 2011 edition.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "In Camelot, players vie for control of Excalibur. Each player controls five Arthurs and a host of other Arthurian characters in a heated attempt to grab and retrieve the sword before any other player succeeds in this task.&#10;&#10;On the surface, the game appears to be a very simple wargame, combat being quickly resolved without any dice as characters fight each other. The key to the game, however, is that two players are always taking turns at the same time, the turns being regulated by &quot;turn tokens&quot; that pass around the board. When one player finishes his or her turn, the turn-token is passed to the next player who does not already have one. If one player is a slowpoke taking his turn, then the other turn-token passes around the table, allowing other players to take turns. This forces players to take very fast turns, usually about 5 seconds each, allowing the game to move along with the intensity of a video game. Games usually take 20 to 30 minutes to play, even with three to six players.&#10;&#10;Special rules resolve potential conflicts that could occur when two players try to perform actions simultaneously where priority is in question, resolving quickly and simply.&#10;&#10;No player ever quite gets knocked out of the game due to loss of characters; Arthurs always &quot;rejuvenate&quot;, returning to your pile of pieces (your &quot;village&quot;) that can enter the board. Characters start at a chosen entry space at the edge of the board, and move to the center to grab Excalibur, returning the Sword to their entry space to win. Each of the 5 character-types (Merlin, Lancelot, etc) have their own unique abilities, but everyone starts with an identical set of pieces.&#10;&#10;There are also two variants in the rules, allowing players to vary the game by going after the &quot;Accoutrements of Kingship&quot; instead of the Sword, or by gathering a number of gold pieces scattered around the board so as to &quot;buy the kingship&quot;. Tokens are included for these variants.&#10;&#10;The game is very intense and fast, requiring players to think on their feet and make fast realtime decisions; if you are a big fan of slow, deep thinking, strategy games, you might look elsewhere.&#10;&#10;",

Players ask another about their hand, e.g. &quot;Do you have three hearts?&quot; Players need only respond with an answer of &quot;more&quot; or &quot;less&quot; if the&#10;number asked is incorrect, and play passes clockwise from the asking player. If the number asked is correct, the questioner receives those cards and play passes to the&#10;answering player. Sets of six rumors collected are placed on the table and score three points. At any point, a player may guess which rumor group is missing, scoring 10 points &#10;for a correct guess and taking a penalty of 5 points for an incorrect guess.&#10;&#10;",

The players are presidents of &quot;minor&quot; football teams and must try to survive to a championship among a lot of misfortunes (such as love affairs with soubrettes and striking players) and in the meantime gain a good placement in the League, major teams not withstanding. Each president buys one or more superstar players and then fields his team to play against other teams. The match is played via dice rolls and adding bonuses and penalties due to coaches, players, referees and event cards. The board is modular so that it may change for every game, and there are many cards, although some have no effect on the game (even though they give a very sharp view of the Italian football championship). A very nice and funny game that cost the developer some legal actions due to real names used in the game itself. In Italian language only.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Mercante in Fiera (=Merchant at the Fair) is a popular game in Italy. Earlier, it was played with 2 decks of 40 cards, nowadays the 2 decks contain 55 cards. A pack shows different illustrations on every card; the second deck is an exact copy of the first one, except the back being different.&#10;&#10;The game is played in 2 phases. During phase 1, all the cards of one deck are sold by auctions of 1-4 cards each.&#10;&#10;Phase 2 is played with the second deck. Before starting, the winning cards are drawn from deck 2 and the paid jetons from phase 1 are put on these cards.&#10;&#10;The remaining cards are revealed card after card and the players having these cards must discard them. The more cards are revealed, the more the chance of having one of the winning cards increases. Players are allowed to trade among each other anytime during phase 2. Such trades are more likely towards the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Winner is the player with the most jetons.&#10;&#10;Mercante in fiera is a newer version with new graphics, contents and updated game flow.&#10;&#10;",

Then your mind becomes possessed; you see visions of Devil's Tower in Wyoming; you hear a weird, mysterious 5-note melody; you travel to Devil's Tower only to discover that others have come for the same purpose. You learn that only one of you will be allowed to board. To board the Mother Ship, you must compete against the others in a game, and win.&#10;&#10;The game. During the game you and your opponents move between Devil's Tower and the Mother Ship. As you move, you try to avoid the hidden traps that your opponents have set for you. At the same time, you try to slow your opponents' progress by creating hidden traps of your own. It's a game of mystery, of concentration, of chance. To play, you'll need nerves of steel. To win, you'll need a few lucky breaks. It's exciting. It's fun. It's unusual. Best of all, it's a game designed to be shared by the entire family.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Game Play Description&#10;&#10;Exile Sun combines some of the most compelling strategic mechanics in a way that delivers a streamlined, integrated, and fast-paced game of competition and conflict. Simplified deck building, hand management, simultaneous hidden worker placement, a card draft, 6 unique player advantages, and a revolutionary zero-luck combat resolution system ensure that playing Exile Sun is like no other game. Private and public card-based objectives give players options for points, but they must choose carefully when allocating their limited resources. The player with the most points accumulated at the end of three game cycles wins.&#10;&#10;A Game Round&#10;&#10;The game simply consists of cycles where each player in turn makes four fleet moves and then ends their turn by moving a pawn on the 'Timer Track'. The 'Timer Track' triggers events like 'Supply' and 'Battle' that effect all players simultaneously. Once each event is resolved, the player turns continue.&#10;&#10;&#10;            Moves - These moves can be regular movement, scanning an enemy fleet, launching a decoy fleet, and initiating a battle.  &#10;            Events - The battle and supply events are resolved with a mechanic that may be best described as simultaneous hidden worker placement. This unique mechanic involves the use of a control card with 10 sliding tabs. The resulting game play is tense, intuitive, and intensely competitive. &#10;        &#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Theme Overview&#10;&#10;Far off and forgotten, orbiting the Exile star, a fragmented group of Colonial powers is struggling to exist in the harsh environment of their foreign home.  Having been unexpectedly cut off from contact with Earth over two hundred years ago, the process of gaining some economic recovery has been slow and arduous.  With dissension rising among the populace, these leaders must compete to gain military, economic, and technological advantages over each other in a race to lead the united colonies in a mission to contact Earth. Time is short. While an outright planetary assault could express dominance in military power, perhaps luring out and destroying an opposing Flagship or Construction Shipyard can have the same effect using fewer resources. Or hit and run assaults with fleets of strike craft can be equally effective. But be warned, leaders dare not neglect their own colony resources, or their supporters will lose faith in them and they&rsquo;ll fall quickly out of the race.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "At first you think you are playing good old Monopoly where they just add some extra buildings to give a little twist. But the longer you play, the more you realise they actually made a whole new game. You start with more money than usual, which gives you the idea you will last longer (with a bit of luck maybe). The fact that now you can build right away when you bought a property, gives so much dynamic to the game. No more waiting until you have the whole set, or not having the set because one player refuses to trade. Even with a couple of single properties you can win the game.&#10;&#10;But not so fast. Everybody wants to win of course. And with the 80 extra buildings they added to the game, nothing was ever so uncertain. On every property you can build residential or industrial buildings. The first is not protected against negative buildings (hazards) and requires positive buildings otherwise the property becomes worthless. The industrial buildings on the other hand are protected but they cost twice as much! So you will have to make choice. And the added electronic device will, besides timing deals, always indicate how many buildings you can exactly make.&#10;&#10;There is also no community chest anymore, only chance. But they have changed the content of the cards which makes the game less predictable and more fun to play- watch your buildings being crushed because of an earthquake or not getting your rent because a player evades the number thrown with the dice.&#10;&#10;Besides these changes, there are many more twists to the game which I will not reveal here but be sure that they all add to the greatness that once was and that now has even become better.&#10;&#10;Monopoly City made its first public appearance at the Nuremberg Toy Fair 2009.&#10;&#10;",

The box contains a board, 1 teacher figurine, 6 pupil figurines, 1 die, 90 pupil cards, 20 teacher cards and 1 class book.&#10;&#10;Once more trouble in the class room, the pupils are busy with everything but their lessons. The teacher is doing his uttermost best to prevent disturbances. Unannounced tests are the most unpleasant means for that. But also tell-tales and careerists are on the side of the teacher. Only those who don't get caught can win the game.&#10;&#10;For starters, every pupil gets a figurine and places it on a school bank of his choice on the board. The teacher places his figurine on the desk on the board. Teacher cards and pupil cards are shuffled in separate stacks. Every pupil gets 4 cards from the their stack. The teacher gets 4 cards from his stack.&#10;&#10;The pupils get to play their cards before the teacher, they have to keep their card turned up side down. The teacher rolls the die after he has played his card. The die indicates how far the teacher can move in the class room. The pupil sitting next to the teacher has to show his card face up. Depending on the card this pupil gets minus point, a remark in the class book, or nothing at all.&#10;&#10;After this all pupils and the teacher place their played card on the discard stack and draw a new card from their stack..&#10;A round ends when the teacher has to play the &quot;end of the hour&quot; card. The next player (clockwise) becomes teacher for the next round. The game comes to an end when every player has played the teacher role and the last teacher has played the &quot;end of the hour&quot; card. The winner of the game is the player with the fewest minus points.&#10;&#10;Despite the shared name and the similar-appearing artwork, this is not the same game as Vorsicht Lehrer!&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "OVERVIEW:&#10;&#10;The Gnumies &amp; their friends from the planet Gnum love big Parties! They like to see Borsis, Dancemites, Boggelors or Divalettis as guests at their parties. But no one wants the dreaded Wullawakis at his party. The Gnummies &amp; their friends are shown on the Gnumies card, &amp; the guests on the party cards. There are 4 of each party card valued from 1 to 10, &amp; one of each party card valued from 11 to 15. The players try to win the most party cards, worth the most points, by playing their Gnumie cards. If a player has 2 or more party cards of the same value, their value multiplies, (2 of kind gets you 20 points, 3 of a kind 50 points and 4 of a kind 100 points). These of course can only be done with the cards that are valued from 1 to 10. A player who wins a Wullawaki, loses points. Having 1 Wullawaki will force you to lose the lowest valued party card that you have. Having 2 Wullawakis will force you to lose the highest valued party card in his party room. With 3 or more Wullawakis, the player will discard as many party cards as he has Wullawakis, (players choice in this case). Of course, the player with the most points at the end of the game is the WINNER!!!&#10;&#10;GAME PLAY:&#10;&#10;1) Any player turns over the top-most card in the party supply stack. &#10;2) Now each player selects a Gnumie card from his hand (Cards have a value from 10 to 100), and places it face-down in front of him (in his Party Room!). When all players have placed their bids face-down on the table, all players then reveal their bids. &#10;3) The player who played the highest valued bid in his party room wins the face-up party card. &#10;4) If 2 or more players tie with the highest bid, the player who has the the most Luckynits (small figures at the bottom of each Gnumie card), wins the party card. &#10;5) The player who wins the party card must discard the Gnumie card that he won with that bid. &#10;6) The other players take back their losing bid party cards. The round is now over and we repeat with Step 1 again.&#10;&#10;7) There is a little twist in the bidding when the Wullawaki card (bad card) comes out. The player with the highest Gnumie card still wins the Wullawaki card, but gets to take back his Gnumie card into his hand and the other players lose their Gnumie cards!&#10;&#10;8) The is also a &quot;WILD CARD&quot; in this game. It is called the &quot;COPICASTOR&quot;. It is a card used to make at least a pair of party cards. The Copicastor takes on the form of the lowest valued party card that the player has in his party room. This insures that a player will have at least a pair of cards and also make the low valued cards somewhat valuable to have, since some people may avoid making a high bid on a low value card. But, if you get this Copicastor it makes that low valued card at least worth 20 points (for a pair).&#10;&#10;9) The game ends when 1 player is left with his Gnumie cards. Since, he can't bid against anybody else, he takes the top most party cards as he has Gnumie cards in his hand.&#10;&#10;10) Scoring is based on attaining pairs, three-of-a-kind &amp; 4-of-a-kind of the numbered party cards that the players bid on (check the Overview paragraph above). If no pairs are attained, the value of that card is scored. So, if you have two 5-point cards, you score 20 Points for having a pair. But, if you have only one 5-point card you score 5 points!&#10;&#10;10) The player with the most points at the end of the game wins!!!&#10;&#10;Ages 8 and up&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Asterix: Das Kartenspiel&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Kitsune (pronounced kit-soo-nay) are Japanese fox-spirits, known for tricking unwary mortals. We come to know them through traditional tales, wherein they do this for many reasons: purely for fun, to devour mortals or steal their souls, and so on. But this card game is about kitsune who play tricks to punish mortal fools for their foolishness, sometimes teaching them a lesson in the process. By correcting mortal foolishness, the foxes earn their tails. Those who gain all nine tails of the mythical spirit fox earn their place among the kitsune elders.&#10;&#10;This is a game of luck and tactics, where each player takes the role of a fox trying to earn his or her tails. Some cards represent the foxes; others, the tricks they can play in their schemes, the fools they must teach lessons to, and the consequences that befall foxes who fail. Suitable for ages 13 and up, Kitsune: of Foxes &amp; Fools is relatively family friendly, but does include some themes suggestive of violence, sexuality, drug use, and a few cards have mild rude language. It's about teaching lessons to profoundly foolish individuals, after all.&#10;&#10;The box comes with 15 fox cards, 70 fool cards(35 uniques),100 tricks(40 uniques), 60 consequences(30 uniques), 70 double-sided fox-fire tokens, 70 tail tokens, 2 d10, and 1 rule booklet.&#10;&#10;",

You are run out of fuel and it&rsquo;s getting dark outside.&#10;&#10;Suddenly there is a nice cosy mansion in front of you. You and your friends being naive as kids have no choice but to come in and find lots of zombies, aggressive dogs, venomous spiders and chaos! Move! Save your life, board up the windows and kill the hellish zombies!&#10;&#10;Gameplay: players move across the house (one cell a turn), search for useful items, block windows and doors, fight zombies. The game field is a map containing hidden dangers (zombies and other monsters) and items (weapons, aid kits, boards for blocking windows and doors). Your goal is to find the car keys and gas, and then escape. Most preferably, escape without losing anyone. Each character has unique properties that help them and the entire team. For example, the police girl has a gun and she doesn&rsquo;t need to look for one in the house.&#10;&#10;A fight against zombies is simulated with a rotating arrow with a range of possible results, from a victory to fleeing the battlefield or suffering a wound. Weapons can modify the result.&#10;&#10;If a monster eats your character, you become a zombie chief. With your help, zombies can chase living characters, block their access to rooms or specific items.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Zombie Fried is a card game where you are a survivor of the Zombie apocalypse.  My fellow Zombies and I now rule the world, and for some reason you humans are trying to prove to each other that you&rsquo;re the best Zombie killer.  You use the few resources that are at your disposal in an attempt to dispose of me and my kin, or to sabotage the other survivors&rsquo; attempts to take out the biggest and best of our kind.&#10;&#10;The object of Zombie Fried is to collect the most points in your Brain Pan, because obviously you can&rsquo;t win without the brains.  You do this by (unfairly to me and my friends) bagging Zombies.  For those of you who are not strong enough (or too lazy) to bag Zombies on your own, you can hire a Big Damn Hero, or BDH, to bag Zombies for you.  You and your BDH use whimsical Zombie killing weapons crafted from the meager resources left after the apocalypse, often modifying them with unusual items to make them inflict more damage on us (innocent) Zombies.&#10;&#10;As if weapons weren&rsquo;t enough, you use Action Plans to help you achieve your goal, often using those same Action Plans to place traps on us poor, unsuspecting Zombies.  I can&rsquo;t be too upset, however, if you&rsquo;re trapping us to prevent other survivors from killing us.  I also fully support your use of Reality Checks to mess with the other pesky survivors&rsquo; plans.&#10;&#10;So if you dare to challenge me, Lord Dead &lsquo;N Buried, go ahead and try.   Foil your fellow survivors&rsquo; plans with traps and Reality Checks, equip and enhance your weapons, hire a BDH, and try not to get eaten.  If you&rsquo;re really lucky you might just make it to the Zombie Fried Halls of Honor and Fame.&#10;&#10;How many cards are there in the core deck?&#10;There are currently 105 Cards in the core game of Zombie Fried. The game breaks into 2 separate decks that come with the core. Zombies  and Resources.&#10;&#10;What types of cards are in the core deck?&#10;&#10;     ZOMBIE DECK - Zombies are a unique set of Unique Zombies that are rated from &quot;easy to stomp&quot; all the way up to &quot;I think i just wet myself&quot;. The Zombie cards are what populate your Killing Field.&#10;     RESOURCE DECK - The Resources Deck comes with several different types of cards that a player may run across.&#10;         Action Plans - These little honey of a cards are cards that a player can either play during thier turn in order to help them defeat the zombie. or they can place it face down under a zombie in the Killing Field as a trap or potential trap to steal. You never know which is a trap and which is a good thing to steal from your opponents when going for a trapped zombie. &#10;         Reality Checks -  are fun. they are card you can play against your opponent to make it more difficult for them to defeat their zombie or there are some Reality Checks that stop of auto-fail the combat of your opponent.&#10;    &#10;     WEAPONS &amp; MODIFICATIONS (MODS) - There are a crazy amount of unique weapons to use. each weapon can be modified with a MOD card that will improve the cards attack power. and some other cards allow you to place more than one mod on a weapon.&#10;     BIG DAMN HEROES (BDH) - These are the last of the warrior breed. you can hire them to do your zombie dirty work for you and equip them with all the crazy weapons you have. &#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Battlecards are best decribed as a &quot;scratch-and-slay trading card game&quot; that preceded the popular Magic: The Gathering, and Pok&#195;&#169;mon Trading Card Game craze.&#10;&#10;There were a great variety of cards arranged into types which included artist profiles, quests, tactics, advanced game rules, checklists, spells, and shields, but the main cards were Fighters.&#10;&#10;Each Fighter card had a series of 25 silver scratch panels around its main central illustration to represent locations of the body. For the basic game, players take turns to make an attack by scratching away a panel of their rival to reveal the symbol underneath. When enough wound symbols were found, one of the fighter's 'life' panels would be uncovered and a skull symbol signified his defeat. The dead fighter card would then be given to the winning player who could use the card's 'purse' (an amount of gold listed in the corner) to purchase 'Wondrous Treasure' cards by mailing Merlin with gold equal to the price agreed on a Trading Post card. These are the rarer &quot;Gold&quot; and &quot;Silver&quot; edition of the 'Wondrous Treasure' cards.&#10;&#10;Quest cards normally required collectors to study their cards carefully then send the correct ones to Merlin so they could claim a reward of gold. For example, to claim a token worth 100 gold, St. Charity's Quest required you to collect five men with no gold in their purses, which obviously required you to defeat them first. Lord Magnoble's quest was worth 200 gold if you identified the artists of the five unsigned pieces in his collection.&#10;&#10;Two different series exist: the UK version and the US version. The US series had 139 cards in the basic series plus eight chase treasure cards (T1-T8). US #140 was the Emperor of Vangoria, not available in packs but redeemed by mailing in all 8 treasure cards (and effectively &quot;winning&quot; the game). The #140 card was available in &quot;Gold&quot; and &quot;Silver&quot; chased versions like the 'Wondrous Treasure' cards by completing the Emperor quest using Gold and Silver 'Wondrous Treasure' cards. US cards were standard US trading card sized with gold scratch-offs and an eggshell finish. The UK series had 149 basic cards as the 8 treasure cards were numbered within the basic set, plus there were two additional strategy cards not included in the US set. The UK Emperor was #150, again only acquired by redeeming all 8 treasure cards. UK cards are larger than the US cards, have a gloss finish and silver scratch-offs. There are also extra rules to cater for using shields in the UK version.&#10;&#10;Buy Microbadge&#10;&#10;&#10;",

This very controversial novel describes a parallel world in which Hitler wasn't successful with his &quot;Kampf&quot; in Germany and became a successful SF-pulp-novelist in the US. The main part of the book is the actual text of Hitler's &quot;Iron Dream&quot;, a pulp-tale about &quot;Ubermenschen&quot; conquering a future world filled with mutant &quot;scum.&quot; The idea of Spinrad's novel was to expose fascist tendencies in 50's American literature. The TFG designers transported this &quot;theme&quot; into a board game which plays like a wargame: future Nazis against future mutants. The names of all protagonists have been changed in an apparent attempt to avoid infringement, but the game clearly takes its slightly tongue-in-cheek approach directly from the book.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "The idea is for players to populate the various oceans with large schools of fish, and then strategically place their animals so they can eat the greatest value of fish.&#10;&#10;The mechanics of the game are simple. There are five oceans which are set out in a column. The rest of the cards are divided into two decks: fish and animals. Fish cards carry values from 0 - 3 points each.&#10;&#10;A player fills his hand with five cards, of which at least one must be an animal card. All animal cards in a player's possession are placed face-up in front of him. Animals are color coded to specific oceans and may only be played on that ocean. Fish may be played on any ocean.&#10;&#10;Players then alternate playing cards to the oceans. Fish cards are played to the right side of an ocean, while animal cards are played to the left of their respective 'home' ocean. Each 'side' may only contain a maximum of five cards.&#10;&#10;The idea is to time the placement of your animal cards so as to score the most points based on the value of the fish already played to that ocean. So, if three fish cards had been played to the Atlantic Ocean, worth 1, 2 ad 0 points respectively (for a total of 3 points), the first player to play an animal card on that ocean (it must be THE animal which can be played on that ocean) will score 3 points. The second player to plan an animal card to that ocean scores double the points (6 points). The third player to place an animal on that ocean scores triple the points (9 points); etc.&#10;&#10;",

(Note that unlike Yahtzee, each symbol is worth only one point; note also that in the lower section, each line has a specific scoring combination, e.g. three elephants score only with two bears, not with a two of something else. Roll five identical items, and you get a 10-point bonus. Whoever has the highest score when all the score sheets are filled wins!&#10;&#10;",

The deck is made up of 135 cards in 7 different colored suits. Each suit is made up of 17 color cards and 2 colored Stop cards. The remaining 2 cards are Superstop cards.&#10;&#10;The basic flow of the game is that everyone grabs cards with one hand and puts it into their other hand until a stop card surfaces and someone yells &quot;Stop &lt;color&gt;&quot; for the color of the stop card. Any players in the process of picking up a card can add this card to their pile. Then, each player counts the number of cards of that color and the player with the fewest (or tied for the fewest) cards in that color receives a -1 card from the initial stock of 15 -1 cards. Additionally, if any player has cards out of order in their hand (not grouped by color), they receive an additional -1. The player who called the Stop then calls Go and the mayhem continues. Superstops cause the play to be stopped and the total number of cards to be compared, with the person with the fewest cards receiving a -1. The game ends immediately when the last -1 card is given out, and the winner is the player with the fewest -1 cards.&#10;&#10;",

You and your rivals start with 10 life points each.  Using a combination of Blasts (unblockable magicks), Spells, and Counter-Spells, you try to reduce your opponents to zero life points and be the last spellcaster standing.&#10;&#10;If you cast a Spell, opponents have a chance to cast their Counter-Spells.  Multiple Counter-Spells can be cast on each other, adding more damage and greater effects, shifting effects, or canceling them altogether.  Imagine one of the wand battles from the Harry Potter movies and you get the idea.  It's quite fun to cast a spell on your buddy, watch someone shift the effects to someone else and add to it, watch someone else shift the effects to yet another player, watch someone dispel that shift, watch the next person dispel that shift, and finally, you shift it back to the original target.&#10;&#10;Wands is best with two to five players.  Games can be as short as a couple of minutes, and it shouldn't take more than ten minutes for anyone to learn the rules.&#10;&#10;Wands is not a collectible card game.

Once constructed, it presents a graveyard, with movement spaces, hedges that cannot be crossed, moving tombs, and a crypt containing a headless ghost. The ghost must be defeated in order to win.&#10;&#10;Each player has two character pawns--only one of which they may chose to move on each turn. They move as far as is permitted by the amount shown on their die roll. Also on each turn, the tomb die is rolled, and one of the tombs is moved. This tomb movement alters the playing field by changing what some of the spaces on the game board represent. In this way, a player might land on a square that is safe, but after a tomb is shifted--they suddenly find that they are left &quot;paralyzed with fear.&quot;&#10;&#10;There is complete freedom of movement, except as stated above, and players cannot cross their own path. One of the special spaces is a &quot;Goosebumps&quot; space. On this space, the player draws a Goosebumps card. Some cards require players to perform an action straight away, others allow players to play now or later. One card allows play at any time.&#10;&#10;During the game, players attempt to foil each other by picking up cards that allow them to turn other players into monsters, move other players onto bad spaces, steal each other's cards, etc. After a player has been turned into a monster, they can only be cured by landing on a &quot;magic potion&quot; square. If you are unfortunate, you can also fall into one of the open tombs--that character of yours is then stuck there until the end of the game. Characters can fall into tombs only by the movement of the tomb--In other words, they cannot be moved directly into a tomb.&#10;&#10;Once a player reaches the crypt, they may attempt to defeat the headless ghost. In order to do so, they first must have picked up a ring card. At the crypt, the player drops the skull down the chute--if it falls the right way, then the headless ghosts springs into the air and the player wins. If not, they can attempt to defeat the ghost on their next turn.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "This game is a variant of six-player Pachisi. Instead of rolling the dice to the determined movement, players are dealt four of five cards to use for movement.&#10;&#10;Players take turns playing cards, with the value of the card determining how far they may move a pawn. Certain cards have special possibilities (a King or an Ace may be played to get a new pawn into play, while a four moves you back instead of forward).&#10;A few spaces on the board have special properties as well, requiring certain cards to be played to enter or leave them.&#10;&#10;If more than two players a playing, they play in teams, devils vs. angels. When you have brought all your own pawns to your safety zone, you must move your partner's pawns (without conferring with each other).&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Balanx is a 2 player balancing game by Kris Burm. The game has a low plastic see-saw grid with spaced grooves. Players have 10 heavy glass marbles in black and white, the same as found in Abalone, and 2 small steel ball bearings.&#10;Players start with their marbles on the opposite side and corner of the grid and move them towards themselves forwards and sideways, but not diagonally. The trick is that before a player moves, they hold the balancing board down on their side, making the marbles roll along the grooves and changing the set up entirely. In addition, the steel balls run in side grooves, affecting the balance of the board and making the game very challenging.&#10;The winner is the first to get their balls across to their corner, but if any balls are left in the opponents corner to block a finish, you lose. &#10;Rules in English, French, Dutch and Swedish.&#10;&#10;Was awarded the title &quot;Best Abstract Strategy Game&quot; by Games Magazine in 1997.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "DOCTOR WHO - BATTLE FOR THE UNIVERSE&#10;&#10;Summary&#10;Doctor Who, Battle for the Universe, is a game of battles and challenges for two, three, or four players. One player takes the part of The Doctor, and the others become one of his three arch enemies, i.e. Davros, The Master, or the Cyber Controller. Each of these characters has a team of four followers, Davros and four Daleks, The Doctor and his assistants, etc. There are also many other characters in the game that may be recruited. By collecting these characters each player tries to build a powerful team. By a series of battles and challenges, players fight for control of the universe until only two players remain and a final great battle decides the victor.&#10;&#10;Characters&#10;There are four main characters in the game, each having a team of four loyal assistants. These are: 1) The Doctor and his four assistants, Tegan, Ace, Romana and K9; 2) Davros and four Daleks; 3) The Master and his evil Time Lords, Morbius, Borusa, Omega and Rani; 4) The Cyber Controller with four Cybermen.&#10;&#10;The remaining cards comprise three Ice Warriors, three Mutants, two Marshmen, The Black Guardian, Linx, Shockeye and Garron. Each card lists the character's &quot;Inner Force&quot; (his inherent strength), and a list of weapons and devices with which he is skilled.&#10;&#10;Set Up&#10;Each player rolls the die -  the highest scorer becomes The Doctor, and takes the character card of The Doctor and places it in front of them. The other players, in order of score, select one of the main characters. The Doctor takes the four white counters - these represent his four regenerations, or lives. The other players take the appropriate colored counters. The Master - black, Davros -  red, etc. Place the silver counter on the ring at the top of the board. (The ring of weapons and devices) on the space marked by the Magic Recorder. The Doctor can then place ONE of his white counters on any one of the Tardis spaces on the three main movement rings on the board. The other players can now place their counters on any of the Hyperspace squares on the board, though not on the same space as another player. The other character cards are left in the box for easy access during the game.&#10;&#10;Movement (always clockwise) is determined by rolling the die. You can move from one ring to another as long as it does not involve an anti-clockwise movement. You land on spaces that allow you to take certain actions: collect a character, hyperspace to any other hyperspace square, Battle Zone 1, 2, or 3. You select a character for battle and the silver counter is moved based upon a die roll, thus selecting your weapon for the battle.&#10;&#10;The ring of weapons and devices is only used during battle and challenges.&#10;&#10;The rules contain sections for &quot;How to play with 3 Players&quot; and &quot;How to play with 2 Players&quot;&#10;&#10;",

While they may not be the same species as him, they come from a common background, from a shared point-of-view as to how they exist and survive in the ocean - and over the years Jolly Octopus (&quot;Jolly O&quot; to his friends) has come to be quite protective of his little crab buddies, so much so that he causes trouble for anyone who aims to harvest crabs from the ocean like so much wheat and reduce them to nothing more than meaty butter-slathered claws on the dinner plate of some would-be &quot;gourmand&quot;.&#10;&#10;Thus your job as a crab hunter extraordinaire in Jolly Octopus will require you to carefully extricate your target crabs from Jolly O's protection without brushing his legs and tickling him, for if you do, you can expect to get away with no crabs at the least and a menacing faceful of suckers at the worst. Two speed settings on Jolly O &ndash; fast and really, really fast &ndash; give you two ways to challenge your crab-plucking skills.&#10;&#10;The first player to retrieve all of her crabs from the safety of Jolly O's squishy bosom wins!&#10;&#10;",

The theme of the game is that you are investors in various comically named inventions. The game has a very curious mechanism that does double duty for rolling the dice and applying Patent Claim clips. (The kids love fussing with it.)&#10;&#10;The game board has an outside track, the Invention Track, and an inside track, the Royalty Track. On the Invention Track is where you pick up the various inventions (like buying properties in Monopoly). Instead of building house and hotels, you get a Patent Claim Clip attached to the invention card. This patent clip has a 0, 1, or 2 on it. The number assigned is random. The higher patent clip number, the more your patent makes you come royalty collection time. Eureka Cards can also be played that allow you to do special actions during your turn. The game limit is set by the usage of the Patent Claim clips. When the last one is used, the game ends.  The player with the highest combined total of cash on hand invention value wins.&#10;&#10;",
