    "description": "This game is based on the book of the same name by Erich K&auml;stner. In the book Emil's money is stolen after he falls asleep on a train. He realizes he has been robbed and enlists the help of some other children, &quot;the detectives&quot;, to help find the man who stole his money.&#10;&#10;The game consists of a two-piece board, which joins together like a puzzle, and 31 tiles depicting city scenery that stick vertically into the board. There are 34 places on the board on which the players can move. Each one is covered by a wooden cylinder. The picture of the criminal is under one of the cylinders. One player will move this cylinder around the board.&#10;&#10;One player plays the role of the criminal, Herr Grundeis, and the other players are the detectives. Herr Grundeis needs to try to cross the board from the station to the park before the detectives, played by the other players, find him. If Herr Grundeis reaches the park, he wins. If one of the detectives finds him, the detectives win. Herr Grundeis moves first. He roles the black die. The detectives now put on their blindfolds. Herr Grundeis now moves up to the number of spaces indicated on the die. He cannot move more than the number of spaces indicated on the die, but he can move less. The detectives see the die so they know how many spaces the criminal may have moved. The detectives remove their blindfolds and are given a clue that partially describes the tile in front of the criminal. The detectives role the white die in turn and move up to the number of spaces indicated, hopefully stopping in front of a tile that meets the criteria mentioned in the clue. The player checks bottom of the cylinder he has landed on to see if Herr Grundeis is hiding there. Each detective roles the die and moves before Herr Grundeis moves again.&#10;&#10;",

To set up the game, the players scatter the 80 cards in the deck face down on the table and place the bell within reach of all players. Everyone then simultaneously starts looking at face-down cards one by one. You can place the first card you see face up to start a row in front of you. To place another card next to this first one, whether on the left or right, the newly placed card must have at least one image in common with the card already in place.&#10;&#10;As soon as a player has seven matching cards in a row, she rings the bell. If she goofed up, she sits out the round until another player creates a row; if she did everything correctly, she scoops up those cards and places them in a pile beside her while all other players reshuffle their cards into those that remain on the table.&#10;&#10;The game ends whenever the last card is taken from the center of the table. Whoever has collected the most cards (i.e., rows) wins!&#10;&#10;",

The apprentice who demonstrates the greatest skill in healing both the sick villagers and the druid himself will be chosen to take on this prestigious role.&#10;&#10;The core mechanic revolves around the strategic use of cards, where players must use the correct plants to heal villagers based on their specific ailments. Additionally, the game encourages intense player interaction through the &quot;Druid&rsquo;s Orders&quot; cards, which allow for special actions such as stealing cards, swapping villagers, or even sabotaging other players' progress.&#10;&#10;The gameplay is dynamic, with turns offering multiple possibilities: from healing your own villagers to disrupting your rivals&rsquo; strategies. Only after healing all your villagers can you attempt to heal the druid, using two specific plants that match his ailments.&#10;&#10;The ultimate goal is to be the first to heal the druid, but achieving victory requires balancing careful planning with the ability to adapt to your opponents&rsquo; actions in this exciting card and strategy game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Conflict in Cross Hares takes the form of either shoving each other back and forth around the map or stealing items.&#10;&#10;Don't worry if you're far back on the path away from everyone else as with the right events or die rolls, you can race ahead of the others!

Cyclists cannot move sideways or backward. The sprinter (green helmet) excels in sprint sections, the rouleur (blue helmet) in plains, and the climber (yellow helmet) in mountain climbs. Each cyclist type, therefore, has different movement capabilities depending on the section they are in.&#10;&#10;Strategies are key to success in the game.&#10;&#10;For instance, the &quot;Wheel/Relay&quot; strategy allows cyclists to form &quot;trains&quot; to enhance their movement. A cyclist can follow or lead a train, maximizing the group&rsquo;s efficiency. Water bottles (blue bases) can be used to perform attacks, granting additional movement steps in the appropriate sections. However, once used, the bottle is discarded, and the cyclist loses the ability to attack.&#10;&#10;Wind is another critical factor, reducing the speed of cyclists riding against it. Wind tokens are placed to indicate which cyclists are affected. Before each turn, players must analyze the cyclists&rsquo; positions, the sections of the racecourse, the wind, and potential strategies.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the first cyclist crosses the finish line. Medals are awarded for the best cyclist, the best sprinter, the best climber, and the best team. The player with the most medals in their team wins the title of &quot;Best Mind Cycling Manager.&quot;&#10;&#10;Do you have the endurance and strategy needed to lead your team to the podium?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "As Marshal of the interstellar fleet, it is your duty to oversee the colonization of nearby regions of the galaxy and thereby ensure the perpetuation of your people at any cost. But your race is not alone in its aspirations for dominance of the cosmos, or in having the power to realize that goal. Races hailing from various star systems venture out in all directions. Many paths are dead ends, but some sectors have sizable deposits of rare minerals that can be refined into the precious fuel crystals that drive your space fleets onward. Soon, a trail of colonies leads out from your homeworld, and soon the races venture into the same cosmic regions. Don&rsquo;t get too attached to your fleets or interstellar empire, because tides can and will turn quickly. Only you can determine the fate of your people: interstellar conquest or infinite servitude.&#10;&#10;StelCon: Infinity is a light strategy war game on a galactic scale. 2-6 players can expect around 30-45 minutes per player, so 2 players can often power through a game in about an hour. The 6 player game is kept short by combining into 3 teams of 2 where the teammates execute their turns simultaneously.&#10;&#10;Variable game board. There are 6 races to choose from, each with its own strengths. Although the jump lanes that connect the sectors forming the galactic map are printed on the game boards, each sector location is covered by a different card from the sector deck each game.&#10;&#10;Sectors are drawn from the deck and placed as the players explore the galaxy, so you never know what you're going to get...unless you do some scouting with your fighter squads or happen to have some telepaths on board your ship (telepaths are handy that way). Some of the sector cards are identical and therefore also create a &quot;bridge&quot; which is a unique adjacency in addition to the normal jump lanes. All this makes for a very different board every time.&#10;&#10;Moving your space fleet around is straight forward. Each ship can move 1 sector per turn, plus 1 extra sector per turn per engine MOD. Your space ships are modular in design, both from a gameplay and a literal perspective. You physically insert engines, extra guns, and fighter squads into holes in the space ships. We call these MODs.&#10;&#10;Combat is simple but tense. Add up your firepower present at the battle site and then toss in a d6 roll. The opponent does the same. Compare the two totals, and the winner keeps the sector in question while the loser retreats and loses a ship from his fleet.&#10;&#10;While the game is a conquest type game, it ends immediately when one player conquers any homeworld, so there's no eliminated player stuck waiting around for the game to finish.&#10;&#10;Conquest cards are the soul of the game. The deck of 120 cards gives tons of gotcha moments, and serious replay value. They allow you to do all sorts of fun things:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Modify the firepower of your sector or your ship&#10;     Boost fuel crystal production (the economy of the game)&#10;     Steal or stop opponent's cards&#10;     Cheat the dice&#10;     Wipe out a whole sector&#10;     Even influence battles your forces are not involved in, adding an element of table-talking diplomacy to the game&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Each time you move forward you reveal an ocean card which can help or harm you!&#10;Get back to the raft first to win, but remember to keep enough Rations or you'll die...&#10;&#10;",

For those who never played the T.E.G. I, as for experts strategists, the new T.E.G. proposes a different way of playing, lots of action and rapid development.&#10;&#10;Each player represents one of the great powers of the world: U.S.A., U.S.S.R., China, Japan, Eastern Europe and Western Europe.&#10;&#10;At the beginning each player chooses, according to their strategic thinking, several military targets: Control, Intervention and Non-Intervention in the various regions of the world. Each target has a value in points. All targets are placed in the Objectives Table.&#10;&#10;After the incorporations are done comes the fighting. The fighting is between ships that occupie the same region, to which reinforcements can be added, brought in from neighboring regions. The battles are resolved without dice, using a Command of Battle. Apart from the armies, ships and planes, there are other elements of exceptional strength: the nuclear missile and the special unit. They are obtained when the player gets certain levels of war potential. At the end of the game, each player sums the points of the objectives achieved. The winner is the one who got the highest score.&#10;&#10;",

The only single dice which score are the five and one, which count 50 points and 100 points respectively.

It uses a n&times;n set of stacking spheres in 2 colors (4&times;4 or 5&times;5 are recommended, but larger sets can be used).&#10;&#10;A 4&times;4 set, for example, is a pyramid of 30 marbles:&#10;&#10;&#10;     4&times;4=16 on the first layer&#10;     3&times;3=9 on the second layer&#10;     2&times;2=4 on the third layer&#10;     1&times;1=1 on the fourth layer&#10;&#10;&#10;The board (n&times;n) starts empty.&#10;&#10;Starting with white, each player places a marble on an empty space or platform (2&times;2 arrangement of marbles).&#10;&#10;The first player making a full line of his color on any layer wins. Lines may be diagonal.&#10;&#10;This is, for a 4&times;4 set, a 4-in-a-row on the first layer, or a 3-in-a-row on the 2nd layer, or a 2-in-a-row on the 3rd layer.&#10;&#10;SPLine was born when researching on stacking spheres.

    "description": "Grand Army of the Republic is a two player Strategic level wargame simulation - designed by Roger Nord and published by Task Force Games in 1988 - covering the whole American Civil War.&#10;&#10;The time is spring 1861 and the place is America, poised on the edge of Civil War between the new Confederate States and supporters of the Union.&#10;&#10;As either the North or the South player, you are given an economic base to build land and naval forces and commit them to the battle. Use of special abilities, general cards and battle cards will influence the outcome.&#10;&#10;The game map covers the United States from the Indian Territory to the Atlantic and from Pennsylvania to the Gulf of Mexico. The armies you build, strengthened by corps and generals, range across these wide spaces by executing Area Movement. &#10;Navies, including ironclads and blockade runners, increase your strategic choices.&#10;&#10;Victory will depend on the pace of battle and vital supplies. The North must deal with a battle track winding ever down-ward in her effort to conquer the Confederacy. A full campaign game and two shorter scenarios let you select the period of the War.&#10;&#10;Grand Army of the Republic provides hours of fun and insight into America's bloodiest conflict, the War Between the States. &#10;Discover the War as it was or could have been.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "It's a beautiful spring day &mdash; the perfect weather for a walk in the forest! You put on your jacket, lace up your boots and set out.&#10;&#10;The leaves rustle on the trees, and the sunlight shines through the branches. A gentle breeze blows as you take a deep breath of forest air. Lost in your thoughts, you turn once here and then again there, sometimes going left and sometimes turning right... Suddenly you hear something rustling behind you in the bushes. You take a few cautious steps towards the noise and discover...a goose?! And it's talking to a goblin? Then all of a sudden, your friends are standing next to you in the forest...&#10;&#10;Umm. You decide it might best to head home quickly. There seems to be something wrong with this forest...&#10;&#10;Which is the shortest way back? You're in luck as the fairy tale characters decide to show you, but your friends are constantly changing the path in Memorinth in their own attempts to get home the quickest. However, with a bit of luck and memory, you'll be the first to get out of the labyrinth!&#10;&#10;To set up, place the clearing tile on the table, then place all of the player pieces on this card, then lay out the other tile to form a 5x5 grid with the clearing tile at the center; alternate the light and dark sides of the tiles, with the clearing tile starting on the light side. Place two of the eight fairy tale characters on each side of the grid.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player flips over an unoccupied tile that matches the light/dark status of the clearing tile. If the revealed side of the tile has one of the eight fairy tail characters on it, you must move your player piece one space toward the side of the grid where this character is located &mdash; but only if a path connects the tile you current occupy and the tile to which you must move. If no path exists, you don't move. Starting with the second round, the clearing tile will flip from light to dark and back again, challenging you to remember which characters are where so that you can move in the direction that helps you best.&#10;&#10;Memorinth also has a &quot;master mode&quot; in which you place four of the fairy tail characters around a special double-sided action tile. On one side of this tile, when you reveal one of the characters next to it, you'll remove a tile from the grid, then add it back on the opposite side of the grid, sliding everything in that row or column. On the other side of the action tile, when you reveal one of the characters next to it, you'll swap two tiles, swap two fairy tail characters, look at the bottom of a tile, or receive a lucky clover token, which you'll need in order to walk on a path with goblins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Each tile depicts one-quarter of a symbol on each corner. When you place a tile, the corners of your tile must match the corners of the adjacent tiles. If your tile provides the fourth corner of a shape, thereby completing it, you earn a point token of that color. At the end of your turn you draw a new tile, and the game ends once all the tiles have been placed or no one can add a tile to the field.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, players tally their points. Here's the fun scoring twist - each point token is worth as much as the number of tokens of that color not claimed. The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;There are only 10 tokens available for each color, so if all of them are claimed, each one is worth zero points! Thus, you need to be watchful of what tokens you claim. Sometimes, less is more.&#10;&#10;",

You have been rummaging and pilfering unwanted food from all the other animals but now the Zoo Keeper is on to you. You must quickly trade all the goods you have collected so you can get the supplies you need and make your escape before you get caught. But be careful, certain actions will raise the Zoo Keeper&rsquo;s suspicion more than others.&#10;&#10;Pilfering Pandas is a reinvention of a classic card game but we've made a huge number of changes, not least creating a cooperative and solo mode. Pilfering Pandas is the third game from Wren Games who aim to bring back gaming to busy people. Pilfering Pandas therefore have a short playtime but we maintain depth of decisions and intuitive gameplay to give a game with some bite.&#10;&#10;Pilfering Pandas has similarities to Rummy as you are making number sets and runs but it also has this really interesting discard pile mechanism and this was the thing that we most wanted to bring to modern-day gaming.&#10;&#10;The Hideout is where you 'discard' a card but unlike traditional discard piles, the Hideout is not a pile, it's a spread of cards visible to all players and, for a fee, you can pick up as many cards as you want from it and make huge plays of sets in a single turn (there's only a hand limit in solo games).&#10;&#10;Players must collect sets and trade them with the Meerkats to earn points to increase their chance of escaping from the zoo. However, they must always stay at least one step ahead of the zoo keeper so they don't get caught by playing and picking up cards wisely and efficiently.&#10;&#10;But didn't want Pilfering Pandas to be just another set collection game so we also introduced a whole new level to set collecting whereby the previous sets you play directly effects what sets you can play in the future, making it much more strategic than traditional set collecting games.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

However, only few people will have the opportunity to&hellip; change the course of history!&#10;&#10;On the occasion of the 600th Anniversary of the Battle of Grunwald, the National Centre for Culture, in order to promote the celebrations, has published a two-players' history illustrated card game  &quot;Grunwald &ndash; the Greatest Battle of 600 years&rdquo;. One of the player is the leader of the Polish-Lithuanian army and the other leads the Teutonic Order. Each of them has a separate deck of 55-cards. The fight is a dynamic 20-30 minutes game.&#10;&#10;The players use the figures of military leaders, historical divisions and unconventional tactics enabling to tilt the scales of victory in one of the players' favour. The rules are simple and easy to learn even for the beginners, and the possibility of applying diverse tactics and strategies makes the game quick and dynamic, each time with a different scenario.&#10;&#10;The game consists of a series of successive clashes between subsequent military leaders and their divisions. The game is won by the player who is the first to gain six banners of the enemy.&#10;&#10;The aim of the game is to familirise young people with history, that is why it includes educational elements such as real historical figures, battle formations and real medieval weapons. It features a description of the battle. The card illustrations were verified for their historical fidelity by a military historian, Tomasz Mleczek. The game was created by Micha&#197;&#130; Stachyra and Maciej Zasowski from the publishing house Ku&#197;&#186;nia Gier, and Piotr Foksowicz and Krzysztof Rogulski are the authors of the illustrations in the form of comic-book-like drawings.&#10;&#10;In the box there are 110 cards (2 decks) together with an instruction including educational elements.&#10;&#10;The game is not for sale and was distributed free of charge, among others, during &quot;The Grunwald Days&quot; on 15-17 July 2010 on the Fields of Grunwald.&#10;&#10;Source - nck.pl&#10;&#10;",

Players try to find out which item was stolen by which person and where. For this you take over the role of the three investigators and their friends - Aunt Mathilda, Inspector Cotta and Uncle Titus. Every character has a special ability which can be used once per game (e.g. move a second time). Just like in the original version, players move on the board. As soon as they enter a room/place, they can ask questions about the crime. Each player has a certain amount of cards in his hand, 3 cards have been put to the side - they say where the crime took place, who the thief is and which item was stolen. It's the players' goal to solve the crime. With the help of questions and your cards, you try to find out as much as possible about the case so that you will be the one to solve the mystery in the end and predict which cards have been set aside.&#10;All items, characters and places are based on the adventures of the three investigators. The place where you can solve the mystery, for example, is the old house trainer in Uncle Titus' salvage yard. Amongst the criminals players can find the investigators' arch enemy Skinny Norris, for example.&#10;&#10;",

They dream of conquering the world but suffer from internal conflicts that prevent their great project from taking shape: the reds are convinced that it is up to them to lead the troops. Same for the blues. And the greens. Not to mention the yellows. It was therefore inevitable that they come to blows. Wormlord tells their story.&#10;&#10;Wormlord is a game that is played simultaneously, without a turn, and consists of conquering spaces by placing knots. It's possible to repel opponents by undoing their ropes and returning them to them. The victory condition varies from one tray set-up to another, but usually it's about conquering a number of objective spaces.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The narrow French/Sardinian victory over Austria was due to the intrepid leadership of individual French corps commanders.&#10;&#10;- Koniggratz, 3 July 1866 &#10;The decisive battle of the &quot;Six Weeks War&quot; came after a month of preliminary maneuvering.

    "description": "Desert War: Tactical Warfare in North Africa, 1940-43, is an historical simulation of the tactical Combat in North Africa from 1941 to 1943.  The scenarios show several common situations involving German, British and Italian Units.  The combination of situations with varying forces allow an almost innumerable amount of different scenarios to be played.&#10;&#10;Desert War is basically a two-Player game. It is played in sequenced turns, during which the Players use a new &amp; unique simultaneous plotting and moving system to move their units on the map, have combat and attempt to achieve certain objectives. The game is played in Scenarios which are various mixtures of forces and objectives.&#10;&#10;The Western Desert, stretching 1,400 miles between Tripoli and Alexandria, was described by one German general as &quot;a tactician's paradise and a quartermaster's hell.&quot; Between March 1941, when Rommel's Afrika Korps arrived in Tripoli, and May 1943, when the last Axis troops surrendered in Tunisia, the conduct of the Desert War furnished the proof for that general's impression.&#10;&#10;Desert War is a tactical simulation designed to recreate the mechanized struggles which took place in the &quot;perfect&quot; tactical terrain of North Africa during World War II. The 22&quot; x 34&quot; two-color mapsheet depicts a composite desert battlefield on which the flat sands are sparsely interrupted by patches of rocky cover or slight differences of elevation. Each mapsheet hex represents a hundred meters of distance and each Game-Turn represents three and a half minutes of actual time. Four hundred die-cut units represent the Allied, German and Italian combat units that contest the differing Desert War situations and scenarios. Opposing infantry companies, supported by tank platoons and anti-tank and artillery batteries engage each other within the tactical game scale of Desen War.&#10;&#10;Desert War is a tactician's simulation tool. Those of you who have been following this series from PanzerBlitz and Combat Command: Tactical Armored Warfare, France 1944 through Red Star/White Star: Tactical Combat in Europe in the 1970's,  know that Desert War is a development of game you won't want to miss.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 3.5 minutes&#10;Hex: 109 yards / 100 meters&#10;Units: Platoon to Company&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 22 x 34&quot; two-color map&#10;One single-side printed countersheet (400 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 10-page folded rulebook&#10;One Simultaneous Movement Plot pad&#10;Two Scenario &amp; Tables players aid sheet&#10;One 6-sided die&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: Low&#10;Complexity Level: Medium&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 2-4 hours&#10;&#10;",

Now you and your friends make up the Revolutionary Committee, overseeing justice throughout the land. Still, now that the queen's gone, it would be a shame to let all that cake go to waste...&#10;&#10;Become the first among equals by amassing honour! Become happy by amassing cake! Send your friends' pawns to the guillotine! First to forty cakes wins!&#10;&#10;Let Them Eat Cake is a game of committees, coercion, and cake. Elect your friends to positions of power in the hope that they look on your patronage favorably &mdash; or denounce them as enemies of the revolution. Alliances and betrayal are all fair game as you try to amass as much cake as you can before the revolution collapses.&#10;&#10;Each player starts the game with a set of voting cards, three pawns, three medals of honour, and some cake. Each round consists of a series of elections, from the Head of Committee to the Food Inspector. Each vote, after negotiating, bribing, and pleading, is simply a matter of each player secretly choosing a voting card of the player they wish to vote for. Each player&rsquo;s votes are multiplied by the number of pawns they have, and whoever is the Head of Committee will break any ties. Importantly, once you&rsquo;ve used a voting card, you cannot reuse it until you&rsquo;ve played all your cards, demanding shifting allegiances throughout the game.&#10;&#10;The first vote of the round determines the Head of Committee, the official tie-breaker. Soon thereafter players determine the Enemy of the Revolution, who must place one of their pawns on the guillotine, immediately and potentially permanently reducing their voting power. Next, players elect a Guillotine Operator, who decides whether or not the pawn on the guillotine is executed or spared. Once settled, a Secretary is elected to divvy out cake and generals to the players, one card per player. But before these cards are taken, the players elect a Food Inspector who may, at the cost of a medal, declare all cake unsafe.&#10;&#10;Throughout the game, players will accumulate medals, generals, and cake. Fewest medals make you the Enemy of the Revolution, but the player with the most Generals is immune to such accusations! Any player can spend their Generals to force a re-election or simply choose the winner of a vote. The game ends when one player reaches 40 or more cakes, a player has their last pawn executed, or the deck runs out. The player with the most cake wins!&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Fantasy Flight Games is proud to announce our newest card game, Penny Arcade! Set in the world of your favorite web-comic, Penny Arcade puts you in the middle of the epic battles between Tycho and Gabe. Unleash attacks at your rival, such as Mein Leapen or the (Cardboard) Tube Strike. Put your Hijinks to good use, employing your beard-growing abilities with Oneupsmanship or the powers of Skullduggery. Collect Stuff, and acquire the Rare Card or your ally in the tub Sir Quacks-a-lot. Hidden in each deck is also the awe-inspiring powers of the Watch, and it is sure to trade hands quite often as abuse is heaped on the head of whoever holds it.&#10;&#10;Each deck features the feel of the characters. Gabe&rsquo;s sees him hiding behind the couch and using his apathy as the ultimate defense. Tycho summons forth his Vast Intellect to overwhelm the boy wonder, and loves nothing more than the feel of a natural 20 with Critical Strike.&#10;&#10;Designed by James Hata, Penny Arcade is a brand new experience. Each turn, you will have to employ your strength and intelligence to best effect to smash the face of your foe. Tycho, being the smarter of the two, can bring to bear many different Hijinks to ensure his victory. Using combinations of Attacks and Hijinks, Tycho can set up the perfect Really Big Word Attack. While not the brainy side of things, Gabe can serve up heaping helpings of pain with his brute strength.&#10;&#10;For fans and newcomers alike, Penny Arcade is a fun, fast-paced card game for two players. Though only one can walk away the victor, both sides will be itching for another go.&#10;&#10;Penny Arcade is a card game for two players featuring the characters from the hit web comic of the same name. Gabe and Tycho employ various attacks, hijinks, and stuff they have acquired over the years to assist them in beating down their rival. Playable in less than 30 minutes, Penny Arcade is easy to learn and impossible to master.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Similar to Black Jack and &quot;vingt-et-un&quot;, Las siete y media is a more simple and familiar game.&#10;&#10;You need a Spanish deck, take away the 8, 9 and 10. The value of the face or court cards: The King (rey), The Knight (caballo) and Jack (sota)is half point and the rest the same value as shown on the cards. Ace is 1 point, 2 two points, etc...&#10;&#10;The objective of the game is to be the player who is nearest to, or who has scored exactly seven and a half points with his cards.   Exceeding this value busts your hand.&#10;&#10;One player takes the role of the dealer, and the other players play  against him. The dealer deals one face down card to each player, include himself. Then, by turns, each player makes a bet and the dealer deals one card to him, this card can be face up, if the player doesn't show his dealt card, or face down if he does reveal  his dealt card. The player may stand if he has seven and a half points   or lower.&#10;&#10;Once each player takes his turn and makes his bet, the dealer plays his cards trying to beat the hands of each player. When the dealer stands his hand, the other players reveal their cards and the dealer must pay the bet or take it from each player depending the value of his hand.&#10;&#10;If one player has seven and a half points  then he becomes the dealer. If more than one player has the same points then the player to the right of the dealer becomes the new dealer.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Imagine a world where humans never existed.  In its place, several other animal species had the opportunity to evolve and occupy the top of the food chain.  In this world, the future is the present, and the power struggle is even more intense.  Certain species dominate large corporations, while others live forgotten in the underworld.  Welcome to the Persona non Grata universe.&#10;&#10;In it you take on the mantle of a hacker willing to dismantle this model of tyrannical society.  To do this, you will need to gather information about the corrupt employees of the biggest corporations, sharing them and stealing them from your opponents.&#10;&#10;The game rounds are played simultaneously: You must select an information card, link to one of your action cards (download, send or encrypt) and pass the rest of the information cards in your hand to the next player.&#10;&#10;After all the information has been played, players compare the relevance of their information in each corporation.  The first two places can score, stealing information cards from other players.&#10;&#10;At the end of 3 rounds, we will count the points.  But be careful, to score in each corporation you will need to activate them with worker cards or headquarters.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the artist&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "In this card game, players propose holiday destinations/types of holidays and then try to win the most points by sending the highest scoring group of people on those holidays. The basic mechanism is trick-taking with an element of bluffing.&#10;&#10;There are two kinds of cards in the game. Each player has five holiday destination cards. They are also dealt 6 traveler cards, which may be men, women or children with a value of from 3 to 8 points.&#10;&#10;There are five kinds of holidays that may be proposed:&#10;A romantic trip to Venice for a couple (one man, one woman)&#10;Night-life holidays in Mykonos with any number of men and women&#10;Trips to an amusement park for any number of children accompanied by one adult (man or woman)&#10;A restful family holiday at Berghotel (one man, one woman and one child exactly)&#10;Fantastic cruises (any number of men or women, but only men or only women)&#10;&#10;The starting player proposes a holiday by placing the card in the center. Three traveler cards are dealt to the centre of the table, one of which is face up - this is the value of the holiday. The other players, in turn, may agree to this destination, or change it by paying one traveler card (and augmenting the value of the holiday). This goes round, players changing destinations as long as they want to and can afford to, until everyone finally agrees on the destination.&#10;&#10;Players then play cards that match the criteria for that destination and the player who plays travelers with the highest score wins the holiday. This is scored as the value from the initial 3 cards plus any extra cards played to change the destination, divided by ten. Points that don't make up to ten exactly don't contribute to the score.&#10;&#10;The player to first score 10 points wins.&#10;&#10;The game has a nice element of bluffing as a player could propose holiday destinations they have no interest in so that after other players change the destination, they can change it to the real place they'd prefer to go.&#10;&#10;",
