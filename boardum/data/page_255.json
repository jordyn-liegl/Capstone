Dunnigan turned his eye to the Western Front. Combat Command was described as &quot;Platoon-Company Level Combat, France 1944&quot;.&#10;&#10;From the Design Notes:&#10;&#10;&quot;PanzerBlitz (published by Avalon Hill) proved to be a very popular game.  It was complex, but most people were enthusiastic about its apparent realism and authenticity.  In point of fact, PanzerBlitz was not all that realistic or authentic.  The game did have its good points.  That it moved at all was a credit to its play-mechanics.  What was lacking was an awareness, and implementation, of some of the more critical aspects of small unit operations.  Chief among these aspects is the &quot;confusion factor&quot;, which becomes nearly decisive at the platoon level.  Other aspects left untreated in PanzerBlitz were the near simultaneity of action and reaction at that scale, as well as a more realistic handling of combined arms coordination.&#10;&#10;Not all of these problems (nor others unmentioned) have been solved in Combat Command.  By merely changing the cale and some of the combat and movement mechanics, we have introduced more change in the game than these innovations themselves suggest.  One rather obvious result is that the game is simpler, easier to play.  This is essential for any game.  Too much time spent on the mechanics makes the simulation more of an exercise than a game.  The game-system for platoon level simulation as it now stands in Combat Command is not yet perfect.  But we do feel it's superior to the system we first introduced in Tactical Game 3 and PanzerBlitz.  We are working on still better game-systems for this scale of operations.  When we finish them, we'll publish them!&quot;&#10;&#10;The Combat Command game system was quickly discarded as the seventies saw SPI release a string of &quot;new and improved&quot; tactical wargame systems.&#10;&#10;",

The first player to collect all the cards needed to fill their chosen zoo wins the game.&#10;&#10;Interestingly, although the game says it can support up to five players, if there is a fifth player that person actually only acts as the game's banker and does not actually participate in the game otherwise.&#10;&#10;The game is asymmetrical; each zoo has its own strengths and weaknesses and favour different strategies.&#10;&#10;Note that there are several different versions of the game with varying mechanics, some of which have much more strategy than others; see the community wiki for details.&#10;&#10;",

You are going to fight beak and claw with those other vultures for the sake of first dibs on dinner. But don't get too greedy, or you might wind up with little more than scraps.&#10;&#10;Vulture Culture pits five or more &quot;friends&quot; against each other in a feeding frenzy free-for-all. The game takes place over five rounds, each of which represents the revelation of a fresh carcass to consume. Yummy. The vulture that escapes the scuffle with the fewest feathers ruffled will enjoy the privilege of prime pickings among the tasty treats available. Conversely, the most beat-up buzzards develop an attitude adjustment, which just might earn them the edge next time around.&#10;&#10;Every round, each player receives the same three actions: one each of Attack, Avoid, and Assist. Each round consists of a series of Attacks which take place without a conventional turn order. Attackers choose the strength of their attack, but increasing the strength makes it increasingly likely that the attack will miss its intended target and strike another bird instead. Additionally, every Attack presents an opportunity for all players to Assist with the devious deed at hand, or Avoid taking damage should events go awry. The catch? Every action can be played only once. You can block any one Attack and take no damage, but that leaves you vulnerable for any other actions that occur that round. Success requires roughly equal parts of clever hand management and deft social manipulation.&#10;&#10;Vulture Culture was created to combine the thrill of thematic games like Munchkin and Cosmic Encounter with the mechanically-minded strategic sensibility of eurogames like Power Grid and 7 Wonders, all in less than an hour.&#10;&#10;",

Players are dealt a hand of cards, which come in five suits numbered 0-9, and each turn they play one card to the table, following suit if possible. If all the cards played are in suit, the player of the highest numbered card wins; if one or more cards are out of suit, however, then the highest one of those cards wins. The trick&rsquo;s winner scores three coins, and the player with the most coins at the end of the game, which lasts several hands, wins.&#10;&#10;&quot;What makes the game tricky are the rule cards, two of which are in play at the start of the game &ndash; make that in play face-down, which means you have to remember what the rules are throughout the hand. Sample rules are 'When you play a card that has an Igor on it, you must say &quot;Yes, Master&quot;' and 'When you laugh, you must follow your laugh with a &quot;Meow.&quot;' At the start of each turn, the dealer can add or remove one rule from play, and the player who wins the most tricks in a hand has the same option, so rules are constantly popping in and out of the game.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

The backs of the cards are also marked with icons that affect play.&#10;&#10;Normally, each player plays one card out of hand, matching either the number or color of the previous card.  However, if a player can not or does not want to play a card from hand, they may instead follow the icon on the back of the top card of the draw pile.  This instructs them to draw cards or flip the card onto the discard pile.  Other special cards are Reverses, Wilds, and Searches (which cause an opponent to draw cards).  A player may also play a HIT card at any time, the next player must play THE, if possible, then DECK.  When DECK is played, the player claims the discard pile for points.  A round ends, and points are scored when a player empties their hand.&#10;&#10;",

Lairs, Treasures, and Knights add special twists to the trick-taking.&#10;&#10;Publisher Blurb:&#10;&#10;Powerful, majestic, brilliant, conniving, &amp; greedy, they live in a highly structured society centered around age. There are five different draconic races, each of a different color: red, blue, yellow, green, and purple; and one all powerful prismatic Queen, the mother of all races. Each of the draconic races is subdivided into three basic age groups: drakes being the youngest, dragons being middle age, and wyrms being the oldest of all. The older the beast, the more powerful and greedy it becomes. In fact, the oldest of each race, called a Great Wyrm, is so consumed by its greed that its lust for treasure becomes its greatest weakness. Of all dragonkind, they alone are willing to risk all to potentially increase their hoard size. This often leads to their downfall.&#10;&#10;The object in this trick-taking card game is to be the player with the most points (indicating draconic power) at the end of six hands (referred to as cycles). You receive points by accurately predicting the number of tricks (referred to as gatherings) you will take and also by taking special card combinations. You want to avoid taking cards with negative points values.&#10;&#10;",

The problem? You don&rsquo;t have a car, but as karma has it, neither do the others.&#10;&#10;You must hitchhike your way there using planes, trains and automobiles&hellip; and the occasional bike from the thrift shop. Hey&hellip; it was 99 cents! &#10;On this journey through the continent, you&rsquo;ll hop into cars equipped with NOZ, turbos, and furry dice. You&rsquo;ll encounter some crazy drivers who might occasionally be drunk and take risky jumps just for the hell of it. You&rsquo;ll wish for awesome upgrades to your lift, but the others are wishing just the opposite.&#10;&#10;On your turn, they&rsquo;ll be praying evil things upon you. Whatever they can think of to hinder your speed. They&rsquo;ll throw old ladies and moose if they have to. They&rsquo;ll send birds in your engine or just simply wish for you to crash and burn. But don&rsquo;t worry, their turn will come and vengeance will be sweet.&#10;&#10;You&rsquo;ll have to strategically manage your limited hand size and choose which deck to draw from. Will you draw transportation cards to hopefully get the best ride in the game? Or will you draw some karma cards to boost your current ride and slow the others down.&#10;While on this awesome road trip, you&rsquo;ll have to choose your path, or let the driver take you further on his own path. The GPS will determine this. You&rsquo;ll have to stop at train crossings and travel through snowy hills, sandy deserts, big cities and farmland.&#10;&#10;The race also has two levels of play. You can play the regular way, which is with the special ability text of the cards, or the Junior way. In the junior level, simply play without the text and use only the numbers. This will help young players learn simple math, strategy, and have fun while doing so.&#10;&#10;But just when you thought the race was over, there&rsquo;s more to come&hellip; expansions with new maps, more vehicles, more upgrades and of course&hellip;more mayhem are already in the works.

The remaining tiles are placed openly on the table. Each player now tries to connect his/her tiles into one picture. Players can take turns taking tiles from the table. A player who took a tile is allowed to put one back there as well, but that is not mandatory, so players can opt to increase the number of their tiles.  &#10;When no one can place any more tiles, the scoring starts. All tiles a player couldn't use counts 2 negative points. Each placed tile counts two points; this is doubled if the tiles form a closed ring. Points can also be scored by connecting the thin vines.

It concerns combat in the &quot;30th century of the Space Era (SE)&quot; between defenders and attackers aboard a &quot;Kyrathan 'Royal' class warp yacht&quot; named (conveniently enough) the &quot;Trek Heaven.&quot; It's a hex-and-counter game, but has character sheets; players can allocate resources to create characters as they would in an RPG.&#10;&#10;The official rules offer four scenarios, designed to ease the players into increasing complexity and role-playing elements: &quot;The Rescue of Princess Rulian&quot; (one rescuer trying to save the kidnapped princess vs. one terrorist), &quot;Krotic's Treasure&quot; (one rich guy and three thugs vs. four pirates), &quot;Random Piracy&quot; (three crew and one die worth of passengers vs. eight or fewer pirates), and &quot;Random Raids&quot; (all conditions GM- or player-designed).&#10;&#10;Approximate playing time is very fuzzy -- obviously the &quot;Rescue&quot; scenario will play much more quickly than a complex user-designed &quot;Random Raid&quot; with lots of role-playing. The maximum number of players isn't necessarily 2, but all of the official scenarios assume only 2 sides or factions. To support more players, teams or special user-designed scenarios would be called for.&#10;&#10;",

B Games seek to teach values and principles about building a more fair and sustainable world, in a fun way. Some of these principles are: Acknowledging a new meaning of success, promoting collaboration, environmental awareness and protection, and social development among others.&#10;&#10;---&#10;&#10;The game is a 4 to 5 player game where each player is a farmer who has come to a land full of opportunities to develop in a sustainable manner plots of land. Although each player is competing with other players to win the game, collaboration, trust and and holistic approach to growth are quintessential to progressing in the game. Thus players compete and collaborate with each other as well as become accountable as a group for the common resources that impact the whole system. The game ends when one or more players reach a total of 7 B points. Yes!, in a Granjeros game there can be one or more winning players simultaneously.&#10;&#10;Granjeros is a turn based game fashioned under European style boardgames. That means that although one player holds his turn, other players play along actively while not in their turn. There is always something to do wether you it is your turn or not.  The central hexagon is where the water well is located. The water well is a key element of Granjeros gameplay as it influences all players in every turn and will determine the conditions for harvesting and selling crops. Inside the water well you will find 7 water buckets.&#10;&#10;Each turn has the following structure &amp; steps:&#10;&#10;a) Take a bucket of water out of the well (put it in front of you).&#10;b) Throw the 8 harvest dice. Check for &quot;pairs&quot; of vegetable/fruits.&#10;c) For every pair, reward each player the corresponding vegetable/fruits and number according the type of plot he has [orchard, barn, farm or industry].&#10;d) Invest resources [land, technology, farmers, seed] to develop your plots either individually or in collaboration with other players.&#10;e) Negotiate and dialogue with other players to plan for future developments. &#10;Regardless that it is somebody else's turn all players are entitled to negotiate and dialogue at all times during the game.&#10;&#10;Every time you evolve your plots, either individually or collaboratively, to higher level of development you will earn B points. First player(s) to reach 7 B points win the game!&#10;&#10;",

Based upon the draw of Conflict cards, players may build forces, learn about their opponent, gain a secret advantage, or enter into a battle. The objective is to be the player at the end of the game with the most victory points, or to win the battle for your opponent&rsquo;s homeland. In addition, 20-card expansion packs are available to improve the selection and capabilities of Arsenal cards and Conflict cards for this set.

Write each player's name in the Score-Keeper.&#10;3 - The youngest player takes the Target Disc first. They will be the first to throw the disc and their Flickin' Chicken.&#10;&#10;PLAYING EACH ROUND&#10;1 - Flickin' Chicken is played in 9 rounds. The person with the lowest score after nine rounds is the winner.&#10;&#10;2 - At the start of each round, throw the Target Disc as far as you can. For the first round, the youngest player throws first. For subsequent rounds, the winner of the previous round, play paper-scissor-rock, flip a coin or other tie-breaking ritual to determinate the thrower. Greco-Roman Wrestling is not reccomended.&#10;&#10;3 - Taking turns, and starting with the Target Disc thrower, each player throws their Flickin' Chicken at the Target Disc, trying to land any part of their chicken on the disc. If you land any part of your Flickin' Chicken on the Target Disc on your first throw, this is a &quot;Pollo-In-One&quot;. Everyone should congratulate you, as it's quite a feat.&#10;&#10;4 - After everyone has thrown, it is now time for your next throw (if needed). The player whose chicken landed furthest from the target disc will go next (throwing from where the chicken landed) continuing with the next furthest player, so forth and so on.&#10;&#10;5 - Repeat this until everyone has landed any part of their Flickin' Chicken onto the Target Disc. Once you hit the target disc, remove your chicken from play. Keep track of your throws as each throw is equal to one point.&#10;&#10;6 - When every player has landed their chicken on the target the round is over. It is now time to score the round.&#10;&#10;7 - Repeat the above until you have played all nine-rounds.&#10;&#10;SCORING&#10;1 - The target Disc has 2 sides, a Bonus side and a Penalty side. Each round is different depending on which side of the Target Disc is facing up after it lands!&#10;&#10;2 - If any part of your Flickin' Chicken is TOUCHING the center white circle of the Target Disc then score accordingly and as follows:&#10;&quot;Penalty +1&quot; - Add one point to your score if any part of your Flickin' Chicken is touching the Penalty Circle.&#10;&quot;Bonus -1&quot; - Deduce one point from your score if any part of your Flickin' Chicken is touching the Bonus Circle.&#10;&#10;3 - After determining if any Bonus or Penalty points apply to a players score, write their score in the Score-Keeper using the including pencil.&#10;&#10;4 - After 9 rounds of play, tally up the players' scores. The player with the lowest score wins! (from the Rules-book)&#10;&#10;",

The goal is to be the last player with cards. The player with the MacGuffin card will frequently win the game, but holding onto that card can prove quite difficult! Also, because there are 23 cards in the deck and players are always dealt an equal number of cards, there will always be some cards that are not in play. Figuring out which cards are missing is part of the strategy!&#10;&#10;Who has the MacGuffin? Will the Assassin take out The Crown? What did the Garbage Collector find in the trash? What will The Thief steal, and from whom? To the shrewd, all may become known, but sometimes all you can do is Shrug.&#10;&#10;",

The White Elephant Card Game simulates this classic holiday game in a quick, light family card game.&#10;&#10;In the White Elephant Card Game you play the part of a no-good cheapskate, unwilling to spend a measly dime on the people on your gift list. However, you will be attending several White Elephant parties. You can take some junk from your attic and exchange it for treasures to give as gifts. If you &ldquo;play your cards right&rdquo; you could fill your gift list for free and no one will be the wiser!&#10;&#10;Each player has a Gift List Card, a list of three people for whom to acquire gifts. The Gift Cards in their hand constitute their &ldquo;attic&rdquo;. There is one &ldquo;White Elephant Party&rdquo; for each card in a player&rsquo;s attic.&#10;&#10;For each &ldquo;party&rdquo; a player &ldquo;brings a gift to the party&rdquo; by placing one Gift Card from their hand facedown on the table in front of them. The first player begins by selecting one of the gifts and &ldquo;opens&rdquo; it by turning it face up. The next player may then select a new gift, or &ldquo;steal&rdquo; an opened gift by taking a face-up Gift Card from a player who has an open gift. When a player steals an open gift they hold it in their hand until a new gift is opened. This way a gift may be stolen only once until a new card is turned over. When a new card is turned over all stolen gift cards are placed face up so the next player may steal any opened gift.&#10;&#10;This continues until the last gift is opened. At this point each player keeps the gift they have and a new party begins. This continues until all of the Gift Cards have been played. At the end of the game each player counts only the one highest-numbered Gift Card they received that matches each color on their gift list. The total of these cards is the player&rsquo;s final score. The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

It was during that period the conventional &ldquo;correlation of forces&rdquo; between the two hostile alliances most favored the communists.&#10;&#10;The scenario portrayed is the one that was most anticipated and feared by NATO&rsquo;s intelligence analysts at the time. That is, despite their knowledge of the existence of Soviets plans to begin such a war with massive chemical and nuclear strikes, the West&rsquo;s military planners gave those schemes little credence. They knew the Soviets understood such a strategy would bring on immediate nuclear retaliation by the West. That would&rsquo;ve ended the war as quickly as it began &ndash; mostly likely along with all of civilization &ndash; with no winner identifiable.&#10;&#10;What was feared then was, one fine summer day, the Soviet units in East Germany would move out from eating breakfast in their mess halls and roll across the border into West Germany. It would&rsquo;ve been a &ldquo;come as you are&rdquo; kind of war, the aim of which would&rsquo;ve been to blitz across Germany &ndash; using only conventional weaponry &ndash; in under a month.&#10;&#10;The Soviets would then have called for a ceasefire before any nuclear or chemical weapons had been detonated or the massive economic power of the Atlantic community brought to bear. With that, West Germany &ndash; the geo-strategic lynchpin of NATO in Europe &ndash; would&rsquo;ve been neutralized and its Ruhr industrial area &ndash; then as now, one of the most important manufacturing centers on the planet &ndash; entirely wrecked. That would&rsquo;ve caused a shift in the global balance of power in favor of the Kremlin, setting them up to deliver the knockout blow later.&#10;&#10;The 50&rdquo; x 35&rdquo; map covers the core area of the Federal Republic of Germany at 6.66 miles (10.8 km) per hex. There are 352 large-size (5/8&rdquo;) unit counters, representing the divisions and brigades immediately on scene at the time, along with the masses of other units that could&rsquo;ve been sent as reinforcements. Each of the 10 game turns represent three days of real time.&#10;&#10;The turn sequence uses the classic fight-move or move-fight structure. Special rules account for heliborne units, Spetsnaz, the ultra-elite Soviet Eighth Guards and Guards Airborne Armies, East German and Czechoslovakian disloyalty, ranged Soviet artillery divisions, air power, supply, the criticality of Frankfurt for US operations, paradrops, German territorials, electronic warfare and variable Soviet victory objectives.&#10;&#10;The overall system is simple, at about 6 on the 1-10 scale. Two experienced players can get through a match in about four to six hours.&#10;&#10;",

Both sides can deploy fighters, assault ships, destroyers, carriers, battle cruisers, and various other vessels.  Mines can be laid to defend outposts and star bases, but can be swept aside with mine sweepers.  Cargo can be captured, and sensors can be jammed to help cloaked ships infiltrate further.&#10;&#10;Each scenario (battle) is resolved as follows.  In the first phase, each player secretly writes down the movement and actions of his units.  The orders of both sides are then simultaneously resolved in the following phases.  After the moves and actions have been resolved, the players repeat the cycle, secretly plotting their orders and openly enacting them.  Combat actions are resolved by rolling dice and consulting the effects from tables.  Play goes on until the scenario's duration has elapsed or a side's Victory Conditions have been met.&#10;&#10;",

These chimeras then compete in various events to determine the best magician.&#10;&#10;The three-ingredient creatures are created simultaneously by all players drawing from the three decks of creatures before them, placing the cards facedown on one of the four contest areas before them. (Each player possesses a large square representing each of the four contests in their personal play area.) Once players have chosen their three ingredient creatures for each of the four contests (twelve in total), they may switch ingredient creature pieces between their four different contest tiles.&#10;&#10;Contests may include mud-wrestling, funniest creature, battle to first blood, potato bag race, and the prettiest creature. Only four are chosen from the deck of available contests, and only the players in first and second place in each contest receive points. The first player to complete their selections for all four contests may declare they are finished, putting a time limit of 30 seconds for all other players to complete their choices.&#10;&#10;Voting takes place between players to see who has the best creature featured in each contest.&#10;&#10;Three rounds are played with the aforementioned steps, with creature and contest cards being reshuffled and redrawn. Each round is roughly 10-15 minutes, totaling to 30-45 minutes per game.&#10;&#10;",
