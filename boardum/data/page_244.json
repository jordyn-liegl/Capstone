In the 17th century, a Mariner Merchant visited port of Innsmouth filled with occultists worshipping Cthulhu and mating with Deep Ones. A late 19th century Arctic Explorer escaped the clutches of the Gnoph-Keh to find a hidden city of the Elder Things. At the turn of the 20th century, a Miskatonic Psychotherapist analyzing the dreams of his patients tapped into nightmares of Leng Spiders and Moon-Beasts. In the 1920's, a Private Eye investigating the disappearance of her farming parents revealed Star Vampires and Mi-Gos as the culprits. All four have been given a second chance at life but must relive and overcome their last and most terrifying days.&#10;&#10;Cthulhu Mash is an easy to learn, fast paced, expandable, random tile, monster generating game that can be played in under an hour.

Fight monsters, find hats, forage for food all while taking in the nuance and cunning of haiku!&#10;&#10;This game pits players against a series of Quests to stop the &quot;Order of the One Extra Syllable&quot;, who are creating discord in the world.  Each player selects one of the four heroes, who proceeds to The Shop to spend any coins he or she may have on new gear (better weapons, healing fruit, bicep oil, or lucky cream), and then ventures forth into the first Quest.&#10;&#10;The series of Quests are six separate decks of Quest cards, which include monster cards and saving throw cards.  If you draw a monster card, you roll appropriate dice for your attack, add any modifiers your character has, then subtract that number from the monster's hit points.  If the monster is still alive, you roll to see what attack it makes on your character.  Your character and monster fight until one of you dies.  If your character survives the fight, he or she gains one or more souls (VPs) and a number of coins (for spending at The Shop).  If your character does not survive, well ... we hope you have collected some souls so you can return to the game!  As a survivor of one or more monsters, you might draw a saving throw card from the Quest deck -- your character could gain treasure, hat racks, fruit, or a disaster!  Roll well when disaster hits!&#10;&#10;As your character proceeds through the six Quest decks, the other players' characters are proceeding through the same Quests, and collecting souls.  The hero with the most souls at the end of the game wins!&#10;&#10;The game also includes the &quot;Tower of Many Muses&quot; expansion, with guest haiku written by Ryan North, Robin Laws, MC LARS, Ali Spagnola, Parry Gripp, Jim Zub, Becky Cloonan, Masked Intruder, Lunar Baboon, &amp; more!  You play this expansion cooperatively as you fight monster after monster, trying to survive to the end of the deck!  Those who survive should write a haiku about their adventure ...&#10;&#10;",

In turn, players roll a colored die, then offer at least one face-down money card to the player indicated by the roll. That player may either accept the offer or challenge it. After challenging the offer, the player rolls a numbered die. If the number is greater than the amount of money offered, the offering player must add at least one face-down card to the mix and begin the process anew. If the die roll is equal to the money, the offer must be accepted. If the roll is less than the offer, the offering player keeps his money and the challenging player must pay the offering player the amount offered. The first player who reaches $25,000 wins.&#10;&#10;",

Set in the Olaf mansion, one player is Count Olaf, while the other player(s) are the Baudelaire children. The game lasts roughly 24 turns, which is how long it will take Mr. Poe to travel to the bank and back to the mansion to visit the children. While he's gone, it is Count Olaf's job to successfully play Tragedy cards to damage The Guardians health (by moving into a room in the manor on which The Guardian's marker is in then playing a special card), while the children attempt to collect items in the manor with which they can thwart Olaf's schemes and restore health to The Guardian. The children win if Poe manages to get back from the bank, but Olaf wins if he drains all of The Guardian's health and kills him. The theme is extremely well used in this high-presentation childrens game.&#10;&#10;Excerpt from the box:&#10;&quot;If you wish to play a game where the hero always wins, the villain is forever defeated, and innocent children are brought to warmth and safety, then I encourage you to put this box down immediately and for something involving lollipops, ponies, or educational flashcards. The lives of Violet, Sunny, and Klaus Baudelaire are fraught with sorrow, mis-fortunate, and unpleasantness, and the game in their honor contains the exact same things.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Speculation is a game about having as much worth as possible when the game ends. And unlike some Monopoly-like games, this one definitely ends when one of the draw piles are empty.&#10;&#10;You start the game with &euro;150,000 and that's all the money you get from the bank. No beauty contests to win here, so you'd better spend them wisely. You will get cards with collectible items, though. And the item value increases the more items you have in the collection. So getting lots of cards in one collection is good, but naturally there is a risk - each collection can possibly be fake and worth nothing. This is controlled by the Insider Information cards which sometimes are available for auction in the game.&#10;&#10;Another interesting aspect of the game is the trading part. If you put cards down on the table, they are always for sale, and if an opponent happens to land on Trade, he can buy a category from you (for the market value). However, you can never lose money on showing your cards, but your opponent may increase his collection and therefore earn more - unless they are fake, of course.&#10;&#10;The final balancing aspect is that the cards that you don't show are not declared properly, so if you land on Tax Razzia, you have to pay for those cards.&#10;&#10;There are also bank-controlled auctions.&#10;&#10;Speculation is a very well balanced, exciting and different economic game and you don't know for sure who's the winner until it's all over.&#10;&#10;The game is in Swedish and scales well from three to five players. It works well for six players as well, but then you have to add a player marker and some money.&#10;&#10;",

To catch Geists, you need to lure them with an exact number of Zingiberi chips. These are earned by moving around the board and landing on numbered squares. The number lets you take or return a chip of that value, but also determined how far you will move next turn. A clever movement system encourages people to cheat and get away with it, or at least makes everyone watch closely. Each Geist, once captured, can also be use to &quot;prank&quot; other players, and this keeps things rowdy but also adds to the strategy. Chili Pepper cards also spice things up since the Geists don't usually like them.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "In medieval Baghdad, a boy named Afumed was working for a general shop. There were many pots containing many kinds of items. His boss gave orders to sort the pots, but Afumed lost the tags on them. Before the boss comes back, he must sort all the pots.&#10;&#10;In The Arabian Pots, you try to sort the pots by listening to the sounds they make when you shake them. The game includes three groups of three pots, with each group making a different sound when you shake it, as well as one pot that makes no sound.&#10;&#10;For the basic game, your goal is to create a row of three pots that make the same sound. To set up, set aside the quiet pot, then place the other nine pots at random in the 3x3 grid of the game board. While all other players look away from the board, the first player swaps pairs of pots three times, not shaking them in the process. All of the other players make three swaps in a similar manner, then the game begins. On a turn, a player takes one of two actions:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Shake one of the pots.&#10;    Swap two pots in the same horizontal or vertical line, without shaking them in the process.&#10;&#10;&#10;If that player thinks a row contains pots that all have the same sound, yell &quot;Complete!&quot;, then shake the three pots to see whether the guess is correct. If so, the player wins; if not, that player loses their next turn and the game continues.&#10;&#10;To use the quiet pot, during set up the first player replaces one of the regular pots with the quiet pot (without shaking anything), then does the pot swaps as usual. If someone shakes the quiet pot during the game, that player must then swap that pot with an adjacent pot while everyone else looks away from the board.&#10;&#10;To play The Arabian Pots with people who are blind, announce which pots (1-9) you are shaking or moving. The notch in the game board indicates the bottom of the board.&#10;&#10;As an alternate set-up, place the nine noisy pots on the board and the quiet pot to the side. Players then remove one pot at a time from the board, shaking them or not as desired, then place the pots in front of themselves. Place the quiet pot on #5, then take turns placing the pots on the board, leaving the final pot aside unshaken. Then play the game as normal except that whoever shakes the quiet pot must swap it with an adjacent pot (while others turn their back) and miss their next turn.&#10;&#10;",

It is a perfect game to get to know each other better and get the party started!&#10;&#10;In 450 Things to Do in Your Life you will find 75 double-sided playing cards, each side contains three different activities. The lead player opens the card, and the player to the left side of him or her calls a random number of the activity. The lead player reads the task out loud.&#10;&#10;After that, each of the players assesses their readiness to perform a particular task with a set of special voting cards that go from 0 - &quot;I wouldn't do it - not in a million years&quot; to 3 - &quot;Wow, I'd love to try it!&quot;.&#10;&#10;When all the players have voted they try to guess an approximate amount of points on the voting cards - a player who will be closer to the correct answer gets one winning point. So in order to win the game it is important to know and feel the other players: what they think of practical jokes, what will be considered funny, and what will be rejected as a stupid idea. The first player to reach 12 points wins the game.&#10;&#10;During the game the players will not only have fun but also learn a lot about each other, and, perhaps, they even learn something new about themselves. Finally you can actually think about all the fun and crazy things to do in your life, like: &quot;Am I ready to shave my head? Or scuba dive, or kiss a frog?&quot;&#10;&#10;Find out how well you know each other in this quirky party game!&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Lifeline is a territorial strategy game for two players (Black and White) that is played on the cells of an initially empty hexhex board. The recommended board sizes are between 3 and 12 cells per side.&#10;&#10;The game was invented by Michael Amundsen and Luis Bola&ntilde;os Mures. Although inspired by Go, it bears a significant resemblance to Kanare Kato's Meridians.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;DefinitionsA group is an entire set of connected stones of the same color. A single stone, not connected to others of its color, is also a group.&#10;&#10;A group is dead if there is no path of connected empty cells between that group and any other group of its color. The path does not need to be a straight line.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;PlayBlack plays first, then turns alternate. On your turn, perform the following actions in order:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Place a stone of your color on an empty cell. If it is your first turn of the game, perform this action twice.&#10;     Remove all dead enemy groups.&#10;     Remove all dead friendly groups.&#10;&#10;&#10;The board positions at the start and at the end of your turn must be different. In other words, if the only stone you remove is the one you just placed, your placement is illegal.&#10;&#10;The last player to make a placement wins. Note that, after your first turn, you will always have a placement available unless you have no groups on the board.&#10;&#10;To make the game fair, White will have the option, on their first turn only, to swap sides with Black instead of making a regular move.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;VariantsThe standard game is made fair by the combination of the double first move and White's swap option, as described above. This balancing method is called strong pie. Some alternatives are:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Weak pie: Instead of placing twice on their first turn, players place one stone on every turn, and dead groups are not removed until there are at least four stones on the board. White's swap option still applies, but takes place after Black has placed only one stone.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Komi pie: Before the game starts, the first player chooses a whole number as the komi value, and then the second player chooses sides. The first four stones are placed in the same manner as with weak pie, but there is no swap option after Black's fist placement. Throughout the game proper, White will have the option to spend a point of komi instead of making a placement.&#10;&#10;&#10;Unlike strong pie, these methods require somewhat large boards to be effective: at least base 6 for weak pie, and at least base 7 for komi pie.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designers&#10;&#10;",

Players start in opposite corners of the board and create a dungeon as they move along by placing randomly chosen tiles.  The goal of the game is to reach the Treasure Chamber in the center of the board and escape back out again with some of the valuable artifacts contained therein.  There are two ways the game can end.  One way is that once someone escapes the dungeon with one of the Warlock's artifacts, they are declared the winner.  The other way is that the players set a time limit.  Once time is up, the game is over and players compare the value of the items they have accrued.  The one with the highest ranked artifact is declared the winner.  If no one has an artifact, then the player with the total highest value in items is the winner.&#10;&#10;Players compete mainly against the board, though player-to-player conflict can happen in two rare instances.  Players earn experience points for defeating denizens of the dungeon and laying tiles in their own quadrant, and this in turn improves their combat speed.  The game components and rules are written in both English and German.&#10;&#10;",

Use the numbered cards to indicate the number of the current round of gameplay, but also the number of hand cards that will be used for this round and the number of points that you can win this round.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of each round, reveal as many hand cards as the number printed on the numbered card. Then, all players start folding their fingers according to what is asked by the revealed hand cards. Usually, a hand card shows a single finger folded &mdash; but sometimes three fingers are folded, e.g., having your hand in a &quot;Bang&quot; position with the index finger and thumb unfolded. Some card also show a fully open hand. The rules are:&#10;&#10;&#10;     If several cards show different fingers to fold on the same hand (left or right), fold them all.&#10;     If a same finger must be folded twice, cancel this action; leave that finger unfolded.&#10;     If a fully open hand is revealed, it cancels all other hand cards that indicate you should fold a finger on this hand.&#10;     If two of the same (left or right) open hands are revealed, they cancel one another.&#10;&#10;&#10;When you think you have the right solution, before locking it, you have to check whether you can shoot someone. (Your character is a cowboy or a cowgirl!) If one of your hands is in the &quot;Bang&quot; position &mdash; index + thumb unfolded OR index + middle + thumb unfolded &mdash; then you can shoot someone at the table, shouting &quot;BANG!&quot;, to steal a victory point from them. If both hands are in the &quot;Bang!&quot; position, you can shout &quot;BANG! BANG!&quot; to steal two points.&#10;&#10;After that step, lock your hands on the table, flipping the hands. Be careful: If a hand has no folded finger, you must place the fist on the table, not a flipped flat hand!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Chomp, chomp, chomp...&#10;&#10;In Karnickel, each player places his rabbit on the circular train track made of eight interchangeable tiles, sets the train engine on its start space, then takes turns rolling the custom dice. After you roll, set any die that shows the &quot;train&quot; out of play, then count up how many times each of the player colors appears on the remaining dice; you must move one of the rabbits (yours or another player's) clockwise around the track the full number of spaces. You then pass the rabbit dice to the next player. Players take turns, each time rolling only the dice passed to them and hopping the rabbits from tile to tile, trying to land on the tiles where they will be able to collect the most carrots.&#10;&#10;When a player rolls only trains, the rabbit hopping has to stop as the train is ready to move! That player rerolls all seven dice, counts up the number of trains rolled, then moves the train that many spaces around the track. Every rabbit on a tile that the train moves through is scared away by the engine and hops off the track, failing to collect any carrots this time. All rabbits still on the track after the train moves &mdash; either because the train didn't reach them or because they were on one of the two tunnel tiles &mdash; get to grab 1, 2 or 3 carrots...or maybe lose one &mdash; exploding carrots are a risk!&#10;&#10;Everyone then hops back onto the track, and the next player rolls all the dice to start a new round of play.

The Ring of Shadows has been found, or maybe wanted to be found, at this critical hour. It's up to the citizens of the Miskatonic Valley to work together to wield its awful power to stop the end before it begins.&#10;&#10;In Shadow of the Elder Gods, 1-4 players take on the roles of citizens of Arkham who work together to prevent cosmic horrors from unraveling reality. Shadow focuses on dealing with the consequences of dark forces conspiring against players, rather than combat. Players take turns spending actions to travel the streets of Arkham researching Knowledge, hiring Muscle, collecting Assets, and dealing with Threats.&#10;&#10;Each game revolves around an inevitable danger to Arkham which is represented by the Threat Deck, a constructed deck of cards which players must survive in order to banish the Elder Threat and win the game. Each threat card features an Arkham face and a Shadow face. The Arkham faces represents the visible manifestations of the unseemly things found on the Shadow faces of the cards. Whenever the player with the Threat Start Marker begins their turn, a Threat token is placed on the current Threat Card and the indicated damage is dealt to players or locations. The first/last card represents the unique Elder Threat which players must contend with in order to win.&#10;&#10;The player who possesses the Ring of Shadows is able to view the Shadow side of the Threat Deck and deal with the Threat at hand by using what resources they have, but they expose themselves and others to harm in the process. If players manage to survive their final encounter with the Elder Threat in the shadows, they unceremoniously save the world from incomprehensible danger.

    "description": "Top Gun Strategy Game puts players in the pilot seats of Team Maverick/Goose and Team Iceman/Slider. Each team takes on the other during a intense air-combat training exercise. Pilots must strategically maneuver their planes and coordinate with their Weapons System Operator. Conducting intense gravity-defying aerial maneuvers and securing a valuable target lock on their opponent will secure a swift victory.&#10;&#10;Being &quot;Top Gun&quot; is a mental challenge as well as a physical one. When they aren't in the air, pilots will face off in a volleyball card game in which they strut their stuff to gain rewards or intimidate an opponent. In order to ensure victory, players must succeed at their ground game to increase their education and confidence, giving them the tools and the nerve to excel in the air game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Jobstacles is an adult party game that mocks the job interview process.&#10;&#10;To win, players must convince the designated hiring manager that their really, really, really bad applicant is always the best person for the job.&#10;&#10;To begin a round, choose a player as the hiring manager and deal three Jobs Cards and three Jobstacles cards to each player.   Job Cards are simply jobs like circus performer, yoga instructor and assassin, while Jobstacle Cards are quirks like  practices nudism, smells terrible and believes the moon landing was faked.&#10;&#10;Next, select a Job Card to act as the Job posting (e.g., rocket scientist) and ask all players except the hiring manager to submit the best job applicant using a Job card from their hand.&#10;&#10;The hiring manager will collect all the cards and then show the full applicant pool to the group.  With full knowledge of the pool, players will have an opportunity to sabotage the applicants they feel are most threatening by placing one Jobstacle card from their hand on the applicant per round.  This additional round is what distinguishes Jobstacles from similar games within the category.&#10;&#10;Finally, the hiring manager will select a winner.  The first player to win three rounds wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "The aliens have attained almost everything they could wish for: galaxy-wide peace, highly developed industries - and a lot of free time on their hands. But what good is all that wealth without proper veneration? And so they wander through space in their quest for love and admiration. A few of these journeys brought them to Earth, but the human inhabitants they met recoiled in fright and confusion. The aliens retreated with dashed hopes and injured pride, but then one of their scientists discovered that the way to a human's heart is through his stomach. This proved to be even more true when the food was laced with a generous dose of psycho pharmaceuticals ...&#10;&#10;As the expedition leader of an alien people, it is your task to build burger diners and fry joints to become the Most Adored Fast Food Manager and conquer the earth.&#10;&#10;",

You win a game round if you place the &ldquo;Golden 12&rdquo; (or more) as the last card (s) on the discard pile. Whoever has the least points at the end of the game (3 rounds) wins the game.&#10;&#10;The game mechanism&#10;is comparable to the familiar card game classics and has new surprises in store. It remains exciting until the last moment! Every round is different - depending on chance or tactical skills. The fun factor is high - and if you suddenly have to hand over your card (s) to your teammate on the way to winning, this will make you want an revenge urgently!&#10;&#10;Game figure Happy-Man &amp; action cards&#10;By placing a &ldquo;% card&rdquo; you get the wooden toy figure.
