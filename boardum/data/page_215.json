Mr. Lincoln's War is organized into two games, the Army of the Tennessee, which deals with the western theater, and The Army of the Potomac, which deals with the war in Virginia. Each game has four short campaign scenarios that recreate the maneuvers and battles of Shiloh, Gettysburg, Atlanta and other monumental Civil War contests. A grand campaign scenario enabling the players to fight the war in the West or East is provided with each game. Both games may be combined for a grand campaign game that simulates the entire Civil War on both fronts.&#10;&#10;Each game contains the following components:&#10;1) One 22' x 28' mapboard covering the eastern or western portion of the United States.&#10;2) 400 die-cut playing pieces.&#10;3) A rules booklet.&#10;4) A scenario booklet.&#10;5) One player-aid and leader display card.&#10;&#10;Each hex represents about 12 miles.&#10;Each strength point represents approximately 2,500 men.&#10;Turns are monthly, except for the winter turns (November to February), which are bi-monthly.&#10;&#10;Additional information:&#10;&#10;Game features alternating player turns including interception movement by the non-phasing player, leaders required to move infantry, special rules for naval and amphibious operations, supply, railroad construction and repairs, a combat system featuring morale and leadership and a campaign game combining both the Potomac and  the Tennessee games. The campaign game also adds politics and production to the mix.&#10;&#10;",

Enthusiasts, get on the search boat to discover Nessie's True Identity! Will the truth be uncovered? Or will the mystery deepen?&#10;&#10;To play the game, place the Nessie figure on one end of the table and the ship on the other end, with the five characters W H A T ? lying down between them. If you are the lead player, think of any noun to serve as Nessie's true identity. (Proper nouns are discouraged.) The other players &mdash; the Nessie fanatics &mdash; now try to guess this identity.&#10;&#10;At the start of a round, you give a one-word hint to the hidden identity. Each fanatic then makes one guess about this identity in whatever order they want. If none of the guesses are close to Nessie's identity, move the ship farther away from Nessie and stand up one of the letters; if any guesses are close but not correct, move the ship closer to Nessie, then stand up one of the letters.&#10;&#10;If one of the guesses matches the identity, don't reveal this when the player guesses. Instead, at the end of the round after all players have guessed, move the ship adjacent to Nessie. On the count of 3, each fanatic must point to the person who they think gave the correct answer, which might be themselves. If more than half the fanatics identify the correct guess, they win; if not, then you win. If five rounds pass and no one has guessed the correct answer, then you'll all be staring at WHAT? and realizing that the clue giver didn't do a good job.&#10;&#10;Nessie's True Identity includes a scoring system in case you want to have everyone be the clue giver once and keep track of points earned over multiple games.&#10;&#10;The second edition of Nessie's True Identity features larger components and reorganized rules, along with a new sighting information card, coverage board, and pen.&#10;&#10;",

The Emperor wanted to avoid any merchants to monopolise the city, therefore he approved for properties to be auctioned to the highest bidder. However, as in any society, some people will always have access to some information others don&rsquo;t and they will try and use that to their advantage, tricking the competition into bidding too high or too low securing the building for themselves. But don&rsquo;t underestimate your competitors for they too know something you don&rsquo;t know!&#10;&#10;This game requires you to bid for property cards and set up the store in the best place. You will earn bonus points for locating your properties in convenient places.&#10;&#10;The game is played over 6 rounds; each round will have 6 possible cards up for bidding and each player will only know 1 to 2 of them. The active player will place an initial bid on their face down card. All other players now have to put their bids in their fist and then reveal simultaneously. The highest bid claims the card and the player places it face up on an empty land.&#10;&#10;The special property cards have 6 different effects to influence the game. This game also includes 2 player game variant and advanced mode.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The poor old chef can't undo the spells because his vision is blurred, so the kitchen elves need to use magic potions to re-dye the bleached ingredients and try to protect them from the gluttonous magic garbage bin and further attacks from naughty students.&#10;&#10;In Magi Kitchen, five wooden ingredients are placed in the middle of the table and the eighty cards are dealt out evenly among the players; cards show either a bleached food item (that is, a white carrot, white cucumber, etc.), a dye, a garbage can, or a student.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player turns over the top card from her draw pile and places it in a personal magic pile. If both a bleached ingredient and the matching colored potion are visible on players' magic piles, then players race to grab the proper wooden ingredient; whoever does so claims the magic piles showing these items and places them under her draw pile. If a rainbow magic potion is revealed, then it matches all bleached ingredients showing on magic piles and players can grab any of them. If a magic hungry garbage can is revealed, players instead race to cover a magic pile that shows a bleached ingredient, thereby protecting it from making its way to the trash; as a reward the player places the magic pile under her draw pile. Finally, if a naughty student card is revealed, everyone must race to perform the magic gesture shown on the card; whoever is the last to do so must maintain this gesture until the next student card is drawn.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one or two players have run out of cards in their draw piles, and whoever has the most cards wins. Magi Kitchen includes advanced rules in which the active player, before revealing her card, decides whether to play on her own magic pile or that of her left- or right-hand neighbor.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "The game board is set up with 3D wall pieces that plug into the board, making a giant maze.  The goal of the game is to be the first player to reach the Finish space.  Dice are rolled to allow a player to first move their pawn, and second to move walls.  The walls pivot around a point allowing the player to open new paths to the Finish, or to block opponents' paths to the Finish.&#10;&#10;There are some special moves that a player may do when the player rolls doubles:&#10;1.  Change places with another player's pawn&#10;2.  Move through walls the number rolled (Double 4's means 4 spaces through walls)&#10;&#10;    Note:  If option 1 or 2 is played, then the player forfeits their option to move walls.&#10;&#10;&#10;3.  Simply play the roll.&#10;&#10;If you are looking for something more strategic than a dice rolling game, there is a second set of rules that eliminates the dice and makes the game more strategic.&#10;&#10;There is also an option to add a &quot;Bad Guy&quot; to game play.  This gives the game an exciting element that makes the players play against each other and against the board.&#10;&#10;The complete set of rules can be seen on the Kickstarter page:  https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/111778715/walls-race-through-a-changing-maze&#10;&#10;",

It is not turn-based and is played as you move around and mingle (or avoid) other players - the game happens continuously at the speed of your strategy.&#10;&#10;It&#202;&#188;s the Roaring Twenties, and corruption is on the rise in your city. The Mob rules the streets, and its reach extends even further&mdash;to the police force, the courts, and even City Hall. The Mob&#202;&#188;s crews of thieves, hitmen, bootleggers, dirty lawyers, speakeasy owners, con artists and cops on the take think they hold the real reins of power in this city.&#10;&#10;The long arm of the law has grown shorter of late, but citizens have reason to hope. An organization of crime fighters unafraid to take a stand has emerged as a force strong enough to oppose the Mob. This crew of untouchables, vigilantes, undercover cops, honest politicians, and special agents are rallying under the new Federal Marshal in town, proving the city the forces of good might be down, but they aren&#202;&#188;t out!&#10;&#10;Now it&#202;&#188;s time for you to choose a side and play your part in deciding the fate of the city&mdash;for better or worse.&#10;&#10;Speakeasy is a game of creative deception, hidden identities, and strategy. To start, one player volunteers as Moderator and gives everyone a secret role on one of two teams: the Mob or the Feds. The fog of war is thick in the beginning, as players&#202;&#188; first task is to use their secret passwords to identify who to trust. As the game goes on, players learn how to hustle as they continue to identify and organize their teammates, discover the other team&#202;&#188;s secrets, sow misinformation, infiltrate the opposition, and score points&mdash;all while watching their own backs. Play ends after one hour, and the winning team is the one that accrues the most points.&#10;&#10;",

The NVA uses dummy units to hide his actual deployment while the US (player) must search constantly and hope not to get caught in an ambush. There are extensive rules covering headquarters units/command and control, fatigue, CIDG, tactical air support, battalion cohesion, and of course air-mobile transport.&#10;&#10;Counters must be mounted and cut.&#10;&#10;",

Passenger cards with the pickup point listed are placed in 5 piles. Any player can pickup any passenger showing. When a passenger is picked up the player takes the card and a new card is turned over in that pile keeping 5 passengers available at all times. You can only have one passenger at a time. Upon picking up a passenger you also draw a destination card and you must drop off the passenger at that location. The fare is paid out from a chart that is very much like the payout chart in Rail Baron. Fares also pay out a small tip. Once a player has obtained 3 pounds (it's a British game) he can add another cab but you still have only 20 movement points to use.&#10;&#10;The very large board is a true maze of one way and two-way streets. Cabs cannot move through other cabs and this can block streets that only have one lane. There are also 2 traffic jams placed each turn that block areas from movement and this also adds to the mayhem. Because of this the second cab can come in handy as it can allow you to use your full 20 points each turn but it will add to the congestion.&#10;&#10;The victory conditions are left up to the players. &quot;The winner is the player with the most money earned in a specified time. Say an hour and a half, or two hours. Or a money limit can be set on the game. The first player to make 15 (pounds) or 20, being the winner.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "A British campaign in the late summer of 1777 had defeated George Washington's American army to capture Philadelphia. The British dispersed their strength to hold the city, reduce Colonial forts along the Delaware River, and watch the Americans, who hovered nearby. Washington saw an opportunity to attack the weakened British at Germantown. The complicated American plan fell apart in dense fog, but a few breaks going their way would have endangered the British position in eastern Pennsylvania.&#10;&#10;Germantown uses the simplified QuickPlay version of the Musket &amp; Saber system of warfare during the muzzle-loading era. Combat is based on unit quality rather than raw numbers, and rewards use of historical tactics. All units are susceptible to rout when weakened, so players must maintain reserves. Leaders enhance unit capabilities. Special rules cover the characteristics of eighteenth century warfare, especially the emergence of light infantry, and the differences between regulars and militia. Winning the battle depends on deployment, thoughtful maneuver to concentrate at the key points, the proper coordination of arms, careful use of leaders and special units, and an understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of each army.&#10;&#10;Scale:&#10;&#10;     Level: Battalion/Brigade&#10;     Hex: 352 yards&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The target Lily Pad Card is determined by the top card in a stack of score cards depicting 1 to 4 bugs. The number of bugs depicted on the top card of the stack represents which Lily Pad Card to aim for (counting that many cards from the active player's side of the table) and the number of points scored if the Frog Disc makes any contact with the target Lily Pad Card. Players keep taking turns flipping the Frog Disc until all of the Bug Score Cards are claimed or one player collects five Bug Score Cards.&#10;&#10;Two sets of FrogFlip can be combined for a four-player game.&#10;&#10;",

Players play irrigation cards that allow them to place plant tiles in the desert, thus bringing life and fertility to it. As the desert grows, cultivation cards may develop the plant tiles further, making them more valuable and bringing players much manna. The player who first gets tiles valued at 20 &quot;fertility points&quot; on the board wins. But watch out! As the desert blooms competition for the land increases, and other players will try to take your most fertile land away.&#10;&#10;The game play in Eden is simple. Either play one or two irrigation cards to develop areas of desert (i.e. place tiles on the board), or play a cultivation card to increase the value of areas already on the board (i.e. replace existing tiles with more valuable ones, at a cost), or pass. Conflict enters the game when a player places a new tile on the board next to an opponent's existing tile. Then a challenge may be made by the player placing the tile. Manna, the currency in the game, is used in the challenge, which takes the form of a bidding war. Bids, which must be divisible by 5, are always increased. But what the winning bidder actually must pay is the bid MULTIPLIED by the value of the tiles that would be gained. In the case of the challenger, the winning bid would be the bid itself times the value of the tiles sought. In the case of the defender, the winning bid would be the bid itself times the value of the tiles the defender is using in what in effect is an attack. Bids keep rising until one player is unwilling, or unable, to meet the final cost of a bid. The loser forfeits all the tiles involved in the conflict, but gains the value of that land (according to the bid) in manna from the other player.&#10;&#10;",

Each player starts at one end of the board, and the goal of the game is to capture or convert the pieces of your opponent.&#10;&#10;Tiles can be moved 1 place horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. You can move one level going up, there is no limitation going down. This means that you can jump on tiles of your opponent if they are at the same height or lower. In this way you convert tiles of your opponent to your own colour. Tiles always move individually: you do not move entire stacks, just the stack's top tile. When capturing, you capture the entire stack.&#10;&#10;You can surrender to tiles of your opponent if they are at the same height or higher. Instead of jumping on top of the stack, you slide underneath it. Your tile is not flipped, and it keeps its own colour. It is a prisoner of that stack. But if a stack holds a majority of prisoners (more than half), there is a revolution. The prisoners become free, and the top tile (and all other tiles of the stack) change to the colour of the prisoners.&#10;&#10;The game ends if one of the players can make no more moves.&#10;&#10;A winner of the 1995 Concours International de Cr&#195;&#169;ateurs de Jeux de Soci&#195;&#169;t&#195;&#169;.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "From the Decision Games' website:&#10;&#10;The Napoleon at War classics are being updated to a brigade-level system with artillery largely in separate units.&#10;&#10;After crossing the Alps in 1800 and advancing into northern Italy, Napoleon overextended his army in an attempt to ambush a portion of the Austrian army. Misreading the situation, the hunter became the hunted when the main Austrian army in Italy, over 30,000 soldiers with 100 cannon, advanced against Napoleon's 18,000 troops and dozen cannon on the Marengo plain. Perceiving the danger, Napoleon urgently summoned his reserves and wayward detachments, bringing his strength up to near parity with the Austrians. It was just enough to forge victory from a potential disaster.&#10;&#10;Marengo utilizes the all-new Musket &amp; Saber combat system, which provides a simple yet accurate portrayal of Napoleonic warfare. The combat system is intuitive, including all the details that characterized battle during the Napoleonic era while also simulating the unique aspects of 19th century warfare. Units can become weakened and rout; attackers can pursue, and the fortunes of war can intervene at any time. Cavalry can rip open enemy lines and shred fleeing units, while reserves must be ready to plug holes or secure the line of retreat.&#10;&#10;A new Combat Results Table emphasizes playability while also simulating the lethality of musket and bayonet engagements of that era. Leaders accelerate the action, replicating the importance of their presence during battle. Supply trains and headquarters help armies function smoothly, forcing players to protect their logistical base. Winning a battle will depend on deployment, maneuver and massing firepower, as well as understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each particular army.&#10;&#10;",

During your turn, you have six dice and you have to decide how many of them you want to use for each step. Climbing up requires to roll dice with matching or higher value than those printed on your chosen space on the board. You can take a risk and try to roll &quot;4&quot; or higher by using only one die or play it safe and use three dice. Used dice become unavailable until your next round, so you should choose wisely. Throughout the race, climbers can use handy items which they picked up at the beginning of the game. Special amulets, energy bars, and professional climbing equipment help players to reach the top faster or (if you are a mischievous rascal) to make climbing harder for other players.&#10;&#10;The game contains three modular two-sided race tracks which allow for the track to be changed at the beginning of each game.

All have gathered in front of a nearby cave entrance with the intention of collecting as many treasures as possible.&#10;&#10;However, deep inside this cave, the Red Hot Silly Dragon is lying comfortably on his mountain of gold, and he is not ready to share his colossal wealth. He will not hesitate to breath his magic fire on anybody getting too close to his savings.&#10;&#10;So caution Hot stuff, Who will dare enter the dragons lair? Who will manage to bring back the most treasures?&#10;&#10;The basic principle of this small risk taking game is extremely simple. During each round of play, all players simultaneously choose an adventurer, from the four of their respective team, which they wish to send into the cave to recover treasures.&#10;&#10;This choice will be done according to a &quot;crystal ball&quot; prediction, which is never highly reliable.&#10;&#10;So players must bear in mind the power and the range of the flame of the dragon, and the &quot;fire resistance&quot; of each adventurer (from very weak for Spark, to very high for Ice Breaker). Also because the cave is narrow the placement of the adventurers in the cave is very limited.&#10;&#10;An ascending order of fire resistances will be carried out. In fact, the more resistant an adventurer is, the slower he runs. In other words, the more you take a risk, the higher your choice of placement will be, but the more likely it is your adventurer will get scorched.&#10;&#10;Lastly, to protect your valorous adventurers from the small sudden changes of mood of the dragon (anger, fury...) as well as the various tricks of your adversaries, who will surely never miss an opportunity to prevent you from recovering treasures, you will have at your disposal a complete set of magic items tailor-made for this kind of &quot;sport&quot; so it's up to you to use them wisely.&#10;&#10;The winner will obviously be the player who has piled up the most treasures at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;",

If she lays down hero cards, she can steal one card of the same color or with the same icon from each of her neighbors. (If her cards share both color and icon, then she must steal cards of the same color or icon.) She then adds these cards to her holdings, sorted by color.&#10;&#10;With each contract card, a player can either scout &mdash; meaning she steals the topmost card from any opponent's hero stack and adds it to her holdings &mdash; or secure a color by placing the contract card on one color of hero stack in front of her. When she does this, the player with the most cards of this color removes one card of this color and places it under her castle card as a point; in case of ties, all players score. The hero cards under a contract card cannot be stolen by a scout, but they can be covered by additional hero cards. After either move, a player then refills her hand to five cards.&#10;&#10;When the deck runs out, keep playing until each player has had the same number of turns, then score each color of hero cards, with the player who has the most of a color scoring three points and the secondmost player one point. Record the points, then shuffle the cards. The game lasts as many rounds as the number of players, and whoever has the high score wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "(from the publisher:)&#10;&#10;Downfall is a wargame simulating the planned but never executed US invasion of the Japanese home island of Kyushu during the last quarter of that year. The design combines factual historical detail with educated guesswork to produce an alternative history simulation covering the period from X-Day +1 through X-Day +30. One player acts as the overall commander of the Allied invasion effort; the other takes the role of the leader of the Japanese defense force. The burden of attack is generally on the American, but both players attempt to win by controlling key terrain on the island and destroying opposing forces. A complete game of DF takes from two to four hours to complete and it's suitable for solitaire play.&#10;&#10;The approach we've taken here is called, among those who deal regularly with alternative history &ndash; which is itself also known as &quot;virtual history&quot; and &quot;alternative outcome analysis &ndash; the conservation of historical reality. That is, to make the assumptions and results of our simulation as valid as possible, we made the fewest possible changes needed to the historic timeline in order to put our alternative one in place. The basic assumption here, then, is that the Japanese simply refused to surrender after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. That would have likely meant one or another of the coups plotted during those desperate days actually went through, putting in place a new war cabinet of ultimate hard liners, men determined Japan should fight to the end no matter what.&#10;&#10;Each hex on the map equals 4.4 miles (about 7 kms) from side to opposite side. Each game turn represents one day. Every ground unit represents a division, division-equivalent, or brigade of about 5,000 to 20,000 men and/or 50 to 350 armored fighting vehicles.

    "description": "Khan: The Rise of the Mongol Empire, A.D. 1206-1295 is a wargame simulating the rise of the Mongols from their origins as a minor nomadic tribe through their sweep across Eurasia, during which they conquered the prominent empires of the age and established a vast realm that stretched from China to Russia and the Middle East. The game has several scenarios, representing the initial Mongol explosion out of Central Asia, the later campaigns of consolidation in the era of Kublai Khan, and a grand scenario representing the entire era.&#10;&#10;Khan is a two-player game. The Mongol player controls the forces of the Mongols themselves, as well as their various subject peoples. The Kingdoms player controls various independent states and rebels who are opposed to the Mongols. The Mongol player, representing a single, centralized empire, has more direct control over his forces. The Kingdoms player, representing a range of sometimes competing powers, will find the game system causes various subordinate forces to enter and exit from his control at different times. Both player's forces are represented by military units and stratagem markers. Players must use a combination of military strength and cunning strategy to expand their power or defend their independence.&#10;&#10;Each game turn represents five years. Each hex is approximately 100 miles across. Each military unit represents 10,000 &ndash; 100,000 troops, plus pack animals, camp followers, bureaucrats, etc. Each leader represents a single great person or cadre of generals and officials, plus an elite bodyguard.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Supercharged is a game about motor racing in the 1930s for 1-5 players. The system allows for a full grid of cars &mdash; not just the players', but also privateers that ran alongside, and usually hindered, the factory teams.&#10;&#10;Each player controls two racing teams: one in the top category and another slower team unlikely to win, but capable of reaching the podium and ending in the money. That is important since the game's winner is based on money earned. Winning, though, is adjusted based on the level of cars a player selects, so taking the &quot;best&quot; cars may not be the optimal strategy for victory when the car ability bonus is applied.&#10;&#10;Gameplay is handled with a randomized team draw that determines player order in addition to generating random events; these events emphasize the dangerous and unreliable nature of 1920s and 1930s driving, courses, and early race technology. On a player's turn, cars move a certain number of spaces with the option of slipstreaming, &quot;charging&quot; (which permits multiple bonus spaces if clear track is ahead), and blocking (which can force trailing cars to spin out).&#10;&#10;The game takes 45-60 minutes to play a race, and games can be combined into a multi-race contest or even a full season if the players wish.&#10;&#10;Supercharged reworks the 1992 game Grand Prix Manager by the same designers.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

In addition, the players could explore the city of DemLoc and could access to exclusive functions improving their knowledge of the world of DemLoc and making their Guild more powerful;&#10;Group game: using the material at their disposal, the players could fight in different missions to gain the control over relevant spots in different areas of the city of DemLoc, increasing their fame and gaining gold (feods). &#10;The app shows the players the objective of the mission (taken from a database; it could range from killing opponent characters to collecting objects on the map) and the map (taken from a database). Using the modular map, the players design the setting.&#10;Using the app, the players choose the mercenaries in the Guild who will join the mission. The game can start once the players have picked their cards and have placed the miniatures on the map.&#10;The game lasts from 5 to 10 turns (based on the objective and on the number of players). On each turn, the players could move their miniatures on the map using the square grid. Characters could shoot, cast spells, conjure daemons, and take part into hand-to-hand fights.&#10;The app is used to apply hits and status to the characters. At the end of the mission, the winner receives Fame points and gold (feods). The Guild uses the Fame to level up (thus being able to enlist more or stronger people). Gold is used to buy new weapons and Arcane Code for the mercenaries.&#10;In each game, the winner could conquer part of the city. His conquest will be shown on the map in the app.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

In this game, players try to collect as many treasures as they can while they try to avoid fighting with brigands and other ruffians.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, the 10 stacks (differed by color and number) of cards (with treasures and brigands) are formed in the middle of the table. Each player receives 2 or 3 characters.&#10;&#10;On a player's turn, they have to choose one of the following two actions:&#10;1. Take one card from one of the stacks and place it face up in front of them.&#10;2. Send all previously gathered cards to the castle using one of their characters.&#10;&#10;Players try to gather as many cards as they can, but the more they have, the more risk they have to lose it all. What's more, action 2 can be performed only 2 or 3 times per game (each character can be sent once). The players also try to remember in which stack the bad cards were taken, because every stack contains the same set of cards.&#10;&#10;The game ends when all of the players have sent all their characters or when nobody has anything more to send and there are no cards to draw. Players now count up their treasure cards. The player with the highest score is the winner.&#10;&#10;There is also an advanced variant which players can choose to play with: It includes the 10 bonus point card, which is given at the end of the game to the player who gathered the most coins amongst their treasures. Also, when a player draws the appropriate card, they have to give it to another player, and then steal all the coins from that chosen player.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "A Pietjesbak (or Pitjesbak, translated: Seedsbox) is an 8 sided wooden box covered with felt. It has a diameter of approximately 38 cm. The game is played in the box using 3 regular D6 dice. You also need a piece of chalk for scoring.&#10;&#10;There are different playing versions of this game. Special houserules/pubrules are common.&#10;&#10;The most common rules:&#10;Each player gets 15 points to start with (or 9 for a short game), marked with chalk on their side of the Pietjesbak.  The purpose is to get the highest score within 3 rolls and with that lose all his points.  The starting player can roll any/all three dice up to 3 times. Each other player gets as many rolls as the first player, and tries to get a higher score.&#10;&#10;One counts as 100, 6 counts as 60,  the other numbers count as their face value. Special combinations have a higher score. The highest score wins the round and the player can reduce their score by 1, 2 or 3.&#10;&#10;The different scores (from lowest to highest):&#10;&#10;     3 numbers that are not one of the special combinations below. The dice are added together. Example: 1,2,6 = 100+2+60 = 162. The winner reduces their score by 1.&#10;     Zand/Sand, 3 identical numbers. Example: 3,3,3. The higher the better (except: 1,1,1 aka Drie Apen). The winner reduces their score by 2.&#10;     Soixante-Neuf/Sixty-Nine (4,5,6 = 4+5+60 = 69). The winner reduces their score by 3.&#10;     Drie Apen/Three Apes (1,1,1 = 100+100+100 = 300, which is unbeatable). With this score you instantly win the game.&#10;&#10;&#10;To summarize (with out-of-sequence ranks in bold-italics): 300 &gt; 69 &gt; triple-six 180 &gt; triple-five 15 &gt; triple-four 12 &gt; triple-three 9 &gt; triple-two 6 &gt; 260 &gt; 220 &gt; 205 &gt; 204 &gt; 203 &gt; 202 &gt; 165 &gt; 164 &gt; 163 &gt; 162 &gt; 125 &gt; ...&gt; 122 &gt; 110 &gt;...&gt; 104 &gt; 70 &gt; 68 &gt;...&gt; 64 &gt; 14 &gt;...&gt; 7 (lowest 2,2,3)&#10;&#10;",

The aim of the game is to come up with the most ridiculous but easy to remember story. Good concentration and focus are two most important things in this game.&#10;&#10;Based on three (or more &ndash; depending on the difficulty level) randomly drawn cards, the players tell absurd, funny, weird or scary stories. The stories have to be unforgettable! The players try to guess which cards will help them create the story. For each good answer you score one point; for each mistake, you lose a point.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "from Consimworld:&#10;&#10;The Situation&#10;There is no greater hero in Scottish history than William Wallace. In 1297 he began what grew into the Scottish Rebellion. The death of his wife at the hands of the English launched Wallace on a quest to expel them from Scotland. Unlike other leaders in the rebellion, Wallace never betrayed his country, his comrades or his cause.&#10;&#10;The Game&#10;SCOTLAND THE BRAVE is based on the opening of the Scottish War for Independence. Beginning with the revolt of a minor land owner named William Wallace in 1297, it culminated in the victory of Robert the Bruce in 1315 at Bannockburn. SCOTLAND THE BRAVE simulates the first two years of the conflict in which William Wallace was the dominant figure. Players take the place of either William Wallace or King Edward of England as each attempts to gain the assistance of Scottish nobles and control of southern Scotland.&#10;&#10;SCOTLAND THE BRAVE originally appeared in issue no. 49 of Shadis Magazine. This Avalanche Press Edition features different components, complete with mounted mapsheet, and new rules. This is a fast-playing game which can be learned and played in a single sitting. Battle is a means to an end, with control of the towns the key to winning. Introducing randomness in the form of Strategy Markers adds a bit of spice. The game system is loosely modeled on the HOUSE DIVIDED game system&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "In Fluffy Bunny Tea Party, you play the part of a group of fluffy bunnies who are having a tea party. Very polite bunnies, who say please and thank you as they serve each other desserts and refill each other's tea cups. When the desserts run out, or when the tea cups are empty, the party is over, and the bunny that was the most polite - the one with the least amount of desserts in front of them - is the fluffiest bunny, and therefore the winner.&#10;&#10;Deadpan hilarious and fast-paced, but with a decent amount of strategy and good-natured backstabbing, Fluffy Bunny Tea Party is a fine game for both children who love bunnies and grouchy adults who soon will.&#10;&#10;",

Every self-respecting monster connoisseur must attempt to capture the image of the famous Loch Ness Monster, but Nessie, turns out, is a bit camera shy, so getting a picture is not just a matter of pushing a button on your camera.&#10;&#10;In Finding Nessie, each player takes on a role of a diver exploring the lake. During their turn, they get a chance at peeking through the muddy waters. But things aren't always what they seem: Was that a tail or just a trick of the eye? Or might it be the rare lucky fish? Be the first to piece the photograph together and make the discovery of the century!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Some items are more common and worth less, like the peppers or citrons are 30, the rarer produce is worth more, the olive oil is 70 for example. Players trade between themselves and then sell sets to market at prices shown on index cards. There are also a few action cards which allow players to force or prevent trades, get bargains etc. 132 cards, nice graphics and the game includes a large score-pad.&#10;&#10;",
