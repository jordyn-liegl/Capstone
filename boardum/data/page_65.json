    "description": "In Fancy Feathers, by order of your baroness, you begin to search for noble pheasants for the pheasantry, moving along a path via a simply but really tricky mechanism, collecting valuable cards and avoiding annoying ones. Sadly, you are not alone. Snatch the most beautiful birds to finish the game with the most precious animal collection.&#10;&#10;When setting up, choose six of the twelve card types included in the game. In total, 924 different combinations are possible! Shuffle the cards, then remove from the game as many cards as three times the number of players, then lay out five cards face up in a row, placing the player tokens in a random stack. On a turn, move your token as far along the row as you wish to land on a card or another player token. If at the start of your turn you were alone on a card and at the back of the row, collect the card you were on, along with any others behind you. After you move, if necessary, lay out cards from the deck so that five cards lie in front of the player who is farthest down the row, then whoever is farthest back in the row takes the next turn.&#10;&#10;Once the final cards from the deck have been placed in the row, you can choose to exit the row instead of moving, and the game is now over for you. Once all players have exited, tally your scores to see who has the most points.&#10;&#10;Fancy Feathers works with up to six players. but to play with more than two people, you need additional copies of the game to have the required numbers of animal cards and wooden discs.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Plotters, Inc., first released as Mit List und T&uuml;cke (&quot;With Cunning and Treachery&quot;), is a trick-taking game with quite a few twists. The deck consists of cards in four suits, and the deck is adjusted based on the player count so that everyone receives a hand of 14 cards to begin a round. At the start of a trick, the lead player plays any card, setting trump for that trick. Each other player plays any card that they like &mdash; except that once three colors of cards have been played, the fourth color cannot be played. Whoever plays the highest trump card wins the trick and collects two of the cards played (or three cards in a game with five or six players), placing these cards in front of them. Whoever plays the lowest non-trump card collects the remaining cards; this player leads to the next trick.&#10;&#10;Once a player has cards of all four colors in front of them, they must choose two colors and leave cards of this color face up, placing all other cards face down. As they collect more cards, they place them face up or face down based on their colors. The round ends after 14 tricks or when a player would be forced to play a card of the fourth color to a trick; in this latter case, the round ends immediately. Each player then scores the cards they've collected. For their two face-up colors, they multiply these numbers together; they then divide this product by the number of cards that they placed face down, rounding this number down. For example, if you have 6 yellow cards, 4 red cards, and 2 blue cards, then you have (6 &bull; 4)/2 = 12 points. If you collect cards of only one color, then you score 0 points!&#10;&#10;Play as many rounds as the number of players. Whoever has the highest total score wins!&#10;&#10;",

Moved by boundless curiosity, the little ones draw these spirits in their notebooks to understand their nature and learn from them.&#10;&#10;With a set-collection core mechanism, the goal of Yokai Sketch is to score more yokai points than the other player by completing sketches of the elusive forest spirits. The game consists of two decks of cards: in one are four types of yokai, each associated with an element (water, fire, earth, and wind) and a numerical value that corresponds to victory points, and in the other, sketches made by humans, two of the four elements, and possibly a special ability.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, the yokai cards are stacked in four decks (one for each element) and three sketch cards are dealt face down to players. On their turn, players draw a new sketch card and slide one of their four cards under one of the four decks in the center of the table so that it reveals the element associated with that yokai. If by doing this the yokai reaches or exceeds the number of sketches needed to draw it (adding the sketches on both sides of the card), the player who has accumulated the most sketches on their side of the table takes it.&#10;&#10;The winner's sketch cards will be placed in the discard pile, and the other player's will stay where they are as they will be used for the next yokai card of that type. If there is a tie in the number of sketches on both sides of the card, the yokai is frightened and lost. In this case, neither player manages to finish the drawing and all the sketch cards on both sides of that yokai pile are discarded. Sketch cards can also include powers: calling the yokai or distracting it to move cards. The game ends when one or more yokai decks are empty.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "The title Dual Gauge refers to the fact that there are two kinds of track - standard gauge and narrow. Standard is more expensive and more efficient, while narrow gauge is cheaper and rather inefficient. These rectangular track tiles are laid across adjacent hexsides, and all companies are able to utilize a shared track network provided they are connected to it. Different types of track will of course call for different types of trains. Stock purchases put funds in the company coffers, and the company uses this money to pay for track. Trains, on the other hand, are paid for in stock value itself. Those trains can also be &quot;rusted&quot; by the purchase of newer models. Companies can also &quot;token&quot; station spaces on the map, increasing their routes while potentially blocking access for rivals. These, too, are paid for in stock value, by decreasing that value by an entire row in the game's capricious two-dimensional stock market.&#10;&#10;This is not only a game, but a game system played on multiple maps. Each map has unique twists, and a set of companies with unique asymmetric abilities. This base set gets the party started with two maps. Portugal is intended as an introduction to the system, but asks players to contend with difficult mountainous terrain. The challenging Detroit map, set in part of Michigan's Lower Peninsula, finds players taking on debt to keep underfunded railroads afloat, all with an eye toward reaching Chicago and its double-route bonus.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The mythology behind the name is believed by many to be the result of a wedding between a man and a woman and the dowry (represented by fields (pits) and seeds.

The game is also used in education among the Asanti children for the development of maths skills.&#10;&#10;Most of the oware available in Ghana is hand carved and comes with traditional symbols of the Asanti people carved into the wood. The traditional playing seeds are Bonduc seeds, a bright green seed with a hard shell. Stones and sometimes recycled glass are used.&#10;&#10;As for the other games in the Mancala Family, the rules differ from country to country; however, for Oware there is an international organization which sets the standard.&#10;&#10;The basic object of the game is to capture more seeds than your opponent. This is done by landing the last seed you are &quot;sowing&quot; in a pit on the opponent's side which already contains one or two seeds.

One player moves the lantern around in search of Shadowlings, mysterious creatures who avoid the light. The lantern illuminates the forest and trees, casting real shadows on the game board. The rest of the players work together, strategically moving their Shadowlings to stay out of the light in this innovative board game for kids and families.&#10;&#10;If one of the Shadowlings is hit by a beam of light, he is enchanted and can no longer move. The other Shadowlings will try to free him again. To do this, they have to wait until the light has moved far enough away so that another dwarf can reach him in the shadows.&#10;&#10;The Shadowlings all want to meet under a tree while the lantern tries to cast a spell on all of them. Who will win?&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "You and your friends have decided to journey to the Antarctic harbor of Neko in hopes of seeing the cute penguins living in the backdrop of the stunning glacier landscape. To get to Neko smoothly, you each try map out the stops along your journey in order to see the most penguins. Your chances improve the farther your ships travel, the more harbours you visit, and the more goods you deliver. But avoid doing things that interfere with the Antarctica ecology and cause the penguins to move away!  Will you be the one that sees the most penguins?&#10;&#10;A Pleasant Journey to Neko is a dice strategy game for 2-4 players. The game plays in four rounds across two periods, each with a mid-game scoring phase. In each round, players roll and draft their dice, which are used to exchange resources, activate existing card abilities, or bid on more cards.  Players can also take a number of free actions, including exchanging resources, adjusting their dice, buying and moving ships, and opening harbors to build more ship lanes.&#10;&#10;Try to plan ahead by building ship lanes that create custom hubs!  These spaces give you additional locations to trigger powerful new actions.  But don&rsquo;t forget about advancing your ships too!  Not only do they score you points, but they can combo with the dice in the hubs you have created.&#10;&#10;A Pleasant Journey to Neko has a unique dice drafting mechanism and card laying system. Over a hundred card combinations exist, making each game different and surprising. Also, don&rsquo;t forget about the advance mode, where you will face more challenges on  your way to Neko. Are you ready to go see the penguins?  We wish you a pleasant journey to Neko!&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Players have to transport drums and load them on ships. For this, they have two workers, a large one and a smaller one, and a set of 5 cards for each worker to move them. There is a scale with counters (for each worker 1 counter) depicting which worker moves first, second and so on).&#10;                                                 &#10;In a turn, all players secretly choose one of the numbered cards from each of their card sets.&#10;&#10;For the worker which is the first to move, the player revealed the appropriate card and moves his worker the amount of spaces as stated by his card. When one of the workers land on an occupied space, the (passive) worker is pushed to the opposite side of the warehouse. When this place is already occupied the (passive) worker won't move. The (active) worker will be moved back to the next unoccupied place.&#10;When all players have made their moves, the warehouses are checked if there is a worker next to a chamber. Players take as many drums in their colour as barrels in the room they are next to. The barrels are placed in one or more of the ships in the harbour (4 ships); players may decide freely.  &#10;                                                  &#10;When a worker is next to a room where broken barrels are, the player must take as many drums in his colour from any of the ships. When a worker is next to a room depicting also a silver coin, the player gets a silver piece from the common stock.&#10;Majorities with barrels on ships are important for scoring points. When a ship is fully loaded, or if it is the leftmost ship, loaded or not, it gets scored at the end of the round after which it is taken away (barrels/drums goes back to the players stock); the other ships move left accordingly and a new ship is taken from a blind stack of ships tiles.  &#10;There are scores for first, second and third positions (the latter in a game of 3 or 4 players) on the ship. &#10;For the next round the last worker (in play order) will become first worker (shifting the counter on the scale).&#10;&#10;For three silver coins an extra worker for the current round can be bought, but this worker always must be the first to move in a round. This worker gets no penalty if his move ends near a room with broken barrels.&#10;&#10;The configuration of the warehouse cards each game is different, as these are loose tiles. When the stack is depleted, the game ends.&#10; &#10;Game Summary&#10;The board shows a randomly ordered group of 7/8 (3er/4er) warehouses, each with 2 rooms containing 0-4 good barrels or 0-2 broken barrels, and 0-1 coin. This is surrounded by a looped movement path with stops in front of each storeroom. Players each have 2 dock workers (Big and Little) which start at opposite ends of the board (off the path initially), and 2 sets of movement cards numbered 1-5 (one set per worker). There are 4 piers, each with a random boat with room for 3 or more barrels. At the start, pier 1 has a &quot;pilot&quot; boat -- occupies space but cannot load goods. Finally, token movement order is set randomly at the beginning of the game: chits corresponding to all workers are placed in a row in random order.&#10;&#10;Each round, players first have the option to pay 3 coins to hire Lazy Jack for this turn (if several want to hire him, priority goes to player with fewer VP). Place the Lazy Jack token with one of your workers. Then, everyone selects and simultaneously reveals a movement card for each worker. If you hired Lazy Jack, play an additional card of the same type (Big/Little) as whoever you placed Lazy Jack with. The workers than all move in token movement order, with Lazy Jack moving first. If they land on another worker, they shift that worker to the opposite side of the movement path, unless that space is already occupied; in that case, the moving worker moves backwards to the first empty space on the path.&#10;&#10;After all tokens have moved, resolve the warehouses in order from one side of the board to the other. If a coin is present, take one from the bank. If there are good barrels in the storeroom, take as many from your stock and load them onto any boat(s). If you take the last open spot, score 1VP and the boat sails: players with barrels on board score VP based on majority (last place scores nothing; ties will score average of sum of ranks, rounding up). Immediately move other boats forward in the pier track, and place a new boat at the last pier. If there are broken barrels in the storeroom, remove as many of your barrels from the boats (exception: Lazy Jack does not unload).&#10;&#10;If there are now 3 or fewer boats in the piers, the game will end -- score all boats and most VP wins.&#10;&#10;If not, the boat at pier 1 scores, then sails away (immediately advance all boats and draw a new one). Finally, if you had dipped into the last 6 boats this turn, randomize the token movement order. Otherwise, the token last in movement order moves up to 1st position. Return Lazy Jack to supply, and start another round.&#10;&#10;",

You and your Heroes can easily disrupt these Rituals, costing you only your precious, valuable time...but ignoring them may close off your last path to the outside world, and the last light your people will ever see.&#10;&#10;Tread carefully and work together to reclaim the FIRE OF EIDOLON&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Raiders of the Deep: U-boats of the Great War, 1914-18 is a new game inspired by Gregory Smith's The Hunters: German U-Boats at War, 1939-43 that places the player in command of a German U-boat during WWI. Completely re-written rules and reworked charts simulate all the major aspects of the First U-boat War, while all-new artwork immerses the player in the atmosphere of the period.&#10;&#10;Your mission is to destroy as much entente shipping and as many capital ships as possible, while advancing your crew quality, winning awards and increasing your commander rank - all while attempting to make it home amidst diminishing odds of survival as the war progresses.&#10;&#10;Conducting patrols is the heart of the system: each game turn you will resolve encounters against individual ships, convoys, Q-ships and enemy aircraft. Situations you will face will demand  decisions such as...&#10;How will you engage a convoy?&#10;Do you risk closing range for a potentially more lethal attack?&#10;If the engagement is at night, will you conduct a surface attack?&#10;With ammunition dwindling, will you try to follow a convoy, or will you look for easier targets?&#10;&#10;Every decision you make during the U-boat war determines whether you and your crew come home as heroes, failures - or not at all.&#10;&#10;The game was designed by a ten year BGG veteran and was developed and playtested with the help of the U-boat game aficionados in the BGG community.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": " Listen pals. We did not fight the Void to make Lumen even brighter. The flying citadel has proven worthless, profiting from scrolls and abandoning us to our empty fate. Can't you figure out the Eternals on their terrace eating grapes and enjoying the show we put on against the Seraphs? &#10;Guess what? we mortals survived and pushed back the Void. We have shown the Seraphs the door. What about the Eternals now?&#10;- Commonly heard in Gon'Mar Taverns -&#10;&#10;Fall of Lumen is a stand-alone tabletop game based on deck-building and tableau building. It is a follow-up of Legends of Void. &#10;The Void battles have ended. The Outer Lands are devastated after years of battles against the Seraphs, and the people are happy to return to a peaceful time and rebuild their houses and society. But a small group of rebels is sick of the citadel of Lumen and works in the shadows to free the Outer Lands from its dictatorship. Their plan is as simple as it will be effective. Bring back the Keepers that once saved the world from the Nihil of the Pale Night and sneak them into the flying citadel as incognito agents.&#10;You play a rebel&nbsp;Hero,&nbsp;an ex-Keeper&nbsp;banned from the Outer Lands long ago. Now you are back thanks to the dimensional fracture caused by the Void. You'll rescue comrades from the Inner Worlds, where the Eternals, the founders of Lumen, banished all of you. You will infiltrate Keepers into Lumen to take power back until the flying citadel becomes the falling one.&nbsp;&#10;You will be supported by a Faction, which shares your cause against the Eternals, and compete with the other Heroes to be the most influential Hero, the one who has infiltrated the most Agents on Lumen.&#10;You will move your Hero across the Outer Lands and spend their skills to gather resources such as Gold, Mana, Mithril, Dark Matter, and Genasi. Using these resources, you will acquire traits, learn spells, buy trinkets, retrieve artifacts, and hire followers to help your cause and improve your skills.&#10;Finally, with enough skills, you can restore the dimensional connection to an Inner World and bring back a Keeper stuck there. To unlock a portal and reach an Inner World, you need a different combination of skills: Deception, Wit, Fighting, Wizardry, and Void (the most precious and versatile skill).&#10;As the game gets closer to the end, your interest will switch from rescuing Keepers from the Inner Worlds to sneaking them onto Lumen, which is the goal of the game and the greatest source of victory points. You can infiltrate a saboteur in any of the five districts of Lumen: Informers, Engineers, Fighters, Wizards, and Voyagers. Each saboteur will grant you a recurring or immediate income and victory points.&#10;&#10;The main mechanics are:&#10;&#10;     Deck-building: the deck is your main resource; improving it by buying better cards will help you perform better.&nbsp;&#10;     Open drafting: market elements are face-up, so you can plan what to buy and collect the resources you need to get them, but you have to get there before the other players.&#10;     Tableau Building: in addition to your deck, you will hire Followers and buy Trinkets for your Hero. They are valuable because you can always count on them and not depend on the luck of the draw draw. You can use them once per turn, and then they are exhausted.&nbsp;&#10;     Area Movement: the game board is divided into eight regions, irregularly shaped. Regions grant access to gather actions, markets, and Challenge locations. During the game, you will move your Hero many times from one region to another to access what you need most at that moment of the game. &nbsp;&#10;     Once-per-game abilities: some cards have very powerful abilities, but you can use them only once per game, then they are removed from the game.&#10;&#10;&#10;The game will feature a Solo mode and a 2-player cooperative variant.&#10;Fall of Lumen has No Take That elements. The interaction between players is indirect. It mainly comes from solving challenges, market acquisitions, and timing the infiltration of Agents on Lumen. The more saboteurs are on a District Window of Lumen, the higher the cost to send a new one. &#10;Our estimated complexity is 3.2 on the BGG scale (max 5.0).&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "(from GMT website:)&#10;&#10;Following on the success of No Retreat! Where the Russian Front of World War II beckons, and then taking the action to the African Front, and then the French Front, game designer Carl Paradis presents the fourth chapter in this game series, No Retreat 4: Italian Front 1943-45.&#10;&#10;This game will be using a mix of all the previous No Retreat! game concepts/systems, including some from the solitaire module, to depict this long and gruelling campaign with the minimum of fuss and the fastest possible play time. Each turn will represent one or two months (depending on the weather), but not every Turn will see major action! So during Frontline lulls very little combat, if any, will take place but for frontline attrition, so these turns will pass in a speedy manner. When a side decide to go on the offensive then that specific turn will see a series of moves/combat/activations (like was done for NR2); using a variant of the regular No Retreat &ldquo;Target/Counterblow&rdquo; rules and markers. The important sea invasions will be shown in great detail, the German fortified positions also, and the long set-pieces battles (like Cassino or Anzio) will be represented correctly without bogging down game play. Like in NR3 &ldquo;Secret Campaign Plans&rdquo; will make an appearance, with players vying to attain special high command objectives, thus getting bonus victory points if the game does not end in an early &ldquo;Sudden Death&rdquo; and continues to the bitter end.&#10;&#10;To make the play surface more easy to use, the long Italian peninsula will be represented by a series of separate maps each showing a part of the battleground. As the frontline moves north or south, players will switch the &ldquo;play map&rdquo; map to show the actual areas of operations, thus saving a lot of table space. It will also be possible under certain circumstances for players to actually change sides in the game (keeping their accumulated Victory points): Thus both will be able to get the chance to be on the &ldquo;attacking side&rdquo; if wished for; historically the Germans were mostly on the defensive. The Event card system will also be changed a bit, with each card allowing multiple possible effects/events: all the cards will be useful, even when the main event cannot be used because of Strategic Initiative.&#10;&#10;Bonus Game&#10;But wait, there is more! For this deluxe edition, the Invasion of Sicily will be added as a separate mini-game. Very fast-playing, and will be an excellent learning or tournament game; that can be also linked to the main campaign game. Could the Axis have delayed the Allies longer on the island? And what if only a token holding attack was made, with the main landings a short while later on the mainland? Or Sicily completely bypassed altogether?&#10;&#10;Italian Front Scenario Listing&#10;&#10;    Regular Game: The 1943/45 full campaign. Both players will choose a &ldquo;Campaign Plan&rdquo; that will instruct them as to their general objectives; there is a chance that one could also be imposed by the game system in case of failure! A players&rsquo; &ldquo;switch of sides&rdquo; could also occur because of the plans or player&rsquo;s will. The outcome of the Sicily mini-game can be linked to this scenario. Players can also change the Strength of the Armies and rate of reinforcements.&#10;    Historical Game:  The 1943/45 full campaign, but with the Plan choices limited to the more historically plausible alternatives. No switch of sides can occur. The Sicily mini-game is not used.&#10;    Short Early game: The first part of the 1943/45 campaign. Only the Southern Italian maps will be used, and the game will end in Early 1944 (historically after the Anzio invasion petered out).&#10;    Short Late game: The second part of the 1943/45 campaign. Only the Northern Italian maps will be used, and the game will Start where the previous &ldquo;Early game&rdquo; scenario stops, and continues until the end of the war in 1945.&#10;    Sicily Game: This mini-game can be played &ldquo;stand alone&rdquo; or linked to the Regular Game Scenario. It also makes for an excellent fast-playing Tournament scenario.&#10;&#10;&#10;TIME SCALE: 1 month per turn&#10;MAP SCALE: 10 miles per hex&#10;UNIT SCALE: Divisions&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;        One 17&quot;x22&quot; two-sided map&#10;        Two 17&quot;x22&quot; one-sided maps&#10;        47 Event cards and 8 Leader cards&#10;        One sheet of 88 round markers; 24 hex markers&#10;        One sheet of 88 two-sided square unit counters&#10;        Rulebook&#10;        Scenario Book&#10;        Player Aid Mat&#10;        Two 6-sided dic&#10;&#10;&#10;DESIGNER: Carl Paradis&#10;DEVELOPER: Jack Stalica&#10;COUNTER ART: Mark Simonitch &amp; Charles Kibler&#10;MAP ART &amp; RULEBOOK LAYOUT: Charles Kibler&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "In Disc Duelers, players control a team of 3-5 characters, which are drafted during the initial set-up. Each of the 52 characters is represented by a card and a disc. The card shows ratings for movement and attacks, plus a special ability. The game can be played on any flat surface, although a four-foot-square table is recommended. Players place everyday objects on the table to act as terrain.&#10;&#10;On his turn, a player activates a character. He may then move and attack by flicking the corresponding disc. A moving disc that hits terrain suffers no damage, but hitting other discs causes one damage to the active character. An attacking disc suffers a point of damage if it hits terrain and causes a point of damage to another character if it hits its disc. Knocking a disc into terrain or off the table inflicts an additional point of damage. A character is eliminated when it takes five points of damage. A character's ratings determine how many times it can move and attack each time it is activated. Optional item cards, if used, can be acquired during play and provide additional actions.&#10;&#10;Disc Duelers includes several play options, including classic elimination, point capture (points scored for eliminating a character, but that character returns to action), soccer or volleyball with a neutral disc representing the ball, and a race.&#10;&#10;",

Each player has their own villain deck, fate deck, player board, and 3D character.&#10;&#10;On a turn, the active player moves their character to a different location on their player board, takes one or more of the actions visible on that space (often by playing cards from their hand), then refills their hand to four cards. Cards are allies, items, effects, and conditions. You need to use your cards to fulfill your unique win condition.&#10;&#10;One of the actions allows you to choose another player, draw two cards from that player's fate deck, then play one of them on that player's board, covering two of the four action spaces on one of that player's locations.

    "description": "As the Second World War raged across Europe, tensions brewed within the seemingly monolithic German war machine. Hitler, like dictators before him, had given his minions overlapping responsibility, so that they would plot against each other and keep him the arbiter. Germany&rsquo;s military leadership worked well enough as Germany&rsquo;s armies advanced in conquest after conquest. But Hitler's no retreat order in the difficult winter of 1941-1942 was a turning point in the way the war was run. All decisions now had to be approved from the top&mdash;a flagrant reversal of the German military tradition of setting objectives and giving subordinates freedom in how to attain them. As victory in the battle for Europe eluded the German generals and final defeat loomed, their competing agendas came ever more to the fore. Contravening their overseer, military leaders looked to a settlement with the Allies and, in a few cases, the end of the regime.&#10;&#10;The Other Side of the Hill is a boardgame that simulates the effects that this struggle for power within the German High Command had on the development of the Second World War. Up to four players represent military leaders cooperating and competing as they manage Germany's wartime strategy. To win, they must vie for Prestige by advancing the careers of their favored Army and Army Group commanders, grabbing their share of victories while the early-war pickings are easy, then avoiding responsibility for battlefield disasters as the Soviets and the Western Allies solidify and push back.&#10;&#10;Players will pursue hidden objectives to dominate the German Officer Corps on behalf of Interest Groups such as the technically-minded Professionals, a traditionalist Old Guard, or anti-Nazi Dissidents&mdash;all while Allied aircraft bombard Germany&rsquo;s war industry and Allied armies press in on every front. As in history, players must reconcile contradictory roles. The German General Staff&rsquo;s job is to hold the Allies off, but each clique&rsquo;s priorities can subvert any collective strategy. And beware: a player may in secret be sabotaging the war effort!&#10;&#10;The Other Side of the Hill offers competition for two, three, or four players as well as fully cooperative, semi-cooperative, and solitaire modes. Playing cards include intriguing historical details on World War Two&rsquo;s real-life German Generals, strategic Directives, wartime Events, and personalities of the &ldquo;Black Orchestra&rdquo; plot to assassinate Hitler. Experience the European Theater of WWII as you have never gamed it before&mdash;from The Other Side of the Hill!&#10;&#10;Game modes&#10;&bull; Competitive: One player will win, even if Germany falls before it historically did.&#10;&bull; Cooperative: Players win or lose together.&#10;&bull; Solo: You make all the decisions.&#10;&bull; Semi-Cooperative: If Germany falls before the historical date, everyone loses. Otherwise, one player wins.&#10;&bull; Campaign Mode: You can play the full campaign in successive shorter and more manageable gaming sessions.&#10;&#10;Scenarios and Playtime&#10;&bull;The Triumph of Blitzkrieg (1939-1941): 3-4 hours&#10;&bull;The World Holds its Breath (1941-1942): 3-4 hours&#10;&bull;Point of No Return (1942-1943): 3-4 hours&#10;&bull;Festung Europa (1943-1944): 3-4 hours&#10;&bull;The Decline of the 3rd Reich(1943-1945): 4-5 hours.&#10;&bull;Total War (1942-1945): 5-6 hours&#10;&bull;World War (1941-1945): 8-10 hours&#10;&bull;Armageddon (1939-1945): 10-15 hours&#10;&#10;&iexcl;You can play this game also in Vassal and TTS!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The game also provides statistics for other early-war German aircraft and Allied pusher aircraft which may be played using this set.&#10;&#10;Flying Machines includes a different variety of maneuvers than was used in the Powerhouse and Handy Rotary books.

    "description": "Ultimate Werewolf is an interactive game of deduction for two teams: villagers and werewolves. The villagers don't know who the werewolves are, and the werewolves are trying to remain undiscovered while they slowly eliminate the villagers one at a time. A moderator (who isn't on a team) runs the game. The game takes place over a series of days and nights. Each day, the players discuss who among them is a werewolf and vote out a player. Each night, the werewolves choose a player to eliminate, while the Seer learns if one player is a werewolf or not. The game is over when either all the villagers or all the werewolves are eliminated.&#10;&#10;Ultimate Werewolf Legacy uses gameplay similar to Ultimate Werewolf, but you no longer have single standalone games as players and the village itself have attributes that are retained between games, with events that take place in the first games having effects that ripple through remaining games. Make a bad decision early on, and it can haunt the village for years to come! Players can earn titles, which provides them with special abilities in future games, regardless of their role. Players are each given a public family card in addition to their secret role card, and they team up with the other members of their family to work together...unless one or more of their family members is secretly working against them.&#10;&#10;As for the village, there are multiple paths that the game may take, and as a result the experience you have playing through the entire game will differ from someone else who is playing with another set of people. This also allows players to play through the campaign multiple times, with a different set of roles, rules, and environments each time.&#10;&#10;At the center of Ultimate Werewolf Legacy is an oversized, 80+ page diary, that walks the game moderator through every session. The diary has been designed so that players with no previous Werewolf playing experience can both play and moderate. The diary is structured into five distinct chapters with three game sessions in each chapter, as well as an introductory preface game session. Players can jump in and out for individual sessions, but ideally they'll play all the sessions in a chapter. Each chapter can be played in a single evening. At the end of the sixteen-game session campaign, the diary will be a record of exactly what happened in your village, and who was ultimately responsible for what it became over time.&#10;&#10;Replay packs that contain a new diary and an additional set of family cards will be sold separately, allowing players to play through the entire campaign again.&#10;&#10;",

(The color/pattern of a tile also shows on its reverse side.) The game has 49 tiles in total, one of each possible combination.

Goods come in four types &mdash; carpets, vases, dates, and (non-date) fruit &mdash; and these goods will be available at markets, with one more market in play than the number of players. Each double-sided market indicates how many face-up and face-down cards are placed there, in addition to the special power of that market.&#10;&#10;At the start of a round, players bid to see who selects goods first from a market, with the bidding rules being set by the back of the topmost goods card in the deck. Whoever wins the bid pays their money to the bank, while everyone else keeps their coins. (Coins are victory points, so you might not want to throw away too many of them!)&#10;&#10;The winning bidder chooses a market, uses the power of that market (if they wish), then takes all of the goods from that market, flips them face up (if needed), then loads the goods on their camels. A camel can hold goods of only one type, and if a goods type is on a camel, then you must continue placing that good on the same camel. Each camel has a goods limit, however, and if you exceed that limit, then you must throw away all of that type of good.&#10;&#10;Each other player in clockwise order then chooses an unchosen market, optionally uses its power, and collects and loads its goods. Each player then has the option of selling goods from at most one camel, with each type of goods paying out in different ways:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Dates: Cards show 1-4 dates, and the more you sell at once, the more money you receive.&#10;    Carpets: Cards come in six colors, and you can't sell the same color twice in a batch. Again, the more you sell at once, the better.&#10;    Vases: Cards come in three types (with some overlap), and you can sell only one shape at a time&#10;    Fruit: Cards come in four types worth different amounts, and you can sell only the lowest-valued fruit.&#10;&#10;&#10;Place a 1 coin on the unchosen market, flip all the other markets, refill those markets with cards, then start the next round. When the deck runs out, complete one more round &mdash; selling once from each of your camels &mdash; then whoever has the most money wins.&#10;&#10;",

See whether you can uncover the truth in echoes: The Microchip.&#10;&#10;echoes is a co-operative audio mystery game. Using the free app, players listen to mysterious noises and voices that are connected to the playing material. Together they look for hints in the sound bites to bring the story parts in order and solve the case.&#10;&#10;In more detail, your task is to assemble the 24 parts of the story in the right order; each part is represented by an object &mdash; either a game board or a card &mdash; and its associated echo. The entire story is divided into six chapters, with each chapter being represented by a game board. By scanning the objects with the app, you'll hear the echo connected with each object, and by using conversations and noises in the echo, you try to figure out which three object cards are associated with a chapter and in which order they should be placed. If you're not correct, the app will inform you which cards are incorrect or in the wrong place; if you are correct, you can listen to the entire chapter all at once &mdash; and you should since new, additional hints can then be heard.&#10;&#10;The objects themselves also provide you with clues from time to time, so neglect no details.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;&quot;This War Without an Enemy&quot; is a 2-player strategic block wargame, funding for launched on Kickstarter on 21st January 2020. The game centres on the First English Civil War, when the Royalist forces fighting for King Charles I were opposed by the English Parliamentarian troops and their Scottish allies, the Covenanters, in a struggle for political, economic and religious control of England.&#10;&#10;The game engine will be familiar to anyone who has played a card-driven block wargame, but it adds a number of innovations in order to faithfully simulate both the warfare of the mid-17th century and the unique nature of this conflict that engulfed not only England but also Scotland and Ireland. The game features individual cards deck for each side, two thirds of which contain events. The card decks are adjusted from year to year to reflect the historical progression of the war. The regional nature of much of the conflict is recreated using a system of Leader and Regional blocks as well as rules for regionally-based recruitment. The usual block game mechanics for field battles have been modified with special rules for artillery, cavalry and infantry, while a completely new system has been designed for storming and sieges.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to acquire Victory Points through the capture of cities held by the opponent. In addition, the Parliamentarians can move closer to victory by capturing the King, represented by his own block. Five scenarios are included:&#10;&#10;     The Full War: up to 26 turns. &#10;     The Early War: an introductory scenario of 8 turns.&#10;     The Mid-to-Late War: up to 18 turns.&#10;     The Mid War: an introductory scenario of 6 turns.&#10;     Prelude to War: up to 27 turns.   &#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "From the designer Frank Branham: A 4 player partnership trick taking game themed around the Mexican Day of the Dead. (A particular favorite holiday of ours, as Sandi and I were married on that day in Marietta Confederate Cemetery.) It is short (about 30 minutes), and rather brain bending.&#10;&#10;Dia De Los Muertos (Day Of The Dead) is played over three days as you send animals, then children, then adults on to the afterlife. It is a basic trick taking game, except that most cards have an action with them. You play as a partnership, and if your side wins scoring cards (the dead or food), you exchange a card with your opponent. Other cards allow swaps between partners, asking a question, cancelling other cards and so on.&#10;&#10;The first time you play, there's a lot of checking the rules, checking the crib sheet, remembering if you exchange cards. You spend more time figuring the game than playing the tricks. But after a couple of hands, it makes sense and you switch to game-playing mode. And here's where it pays. If you enjoy Bridge, you can figure out what your partner signals when they swap a card, or you can read the deck based on what's been played, you will really enjoy Dia De Los Muertos. If you don't like Bridge, or can't figure trick-taking games anyway, steer well clear. It is rather brain-bending.&#10;&#10;The original game has nice native graphics of the dead abroad and has a variant for 3 players. The re-issue as Four Dragons has an oriental theme.&#10;&#10;Not to be confused with:&#10;&#10;     Dia de los Muertos (2007)&#10;     Dia de los Muertos (2016)&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The first player or team to move all of its tokens to the target area first wins.&#10;&#10;What distinguishes Dog Royal from Dog are two twists: First, Dog Royal includes a number of special cards not present in the previous game. You can move 1-7 spaces, switch the location of two tokens, draw one token to another like a magnet, equal the value of the card previously played, and more.&#10;&#10;Second, each of the four tokens controlled by a player bears a symbol &ndash; king, knight, citizen, jester &ndash; and each such token has a special power. The king, for example, cannot move more than seven spaces on a turn, so all cards with a higher value cannot be used to move the king, but the king cannot be bumped off the track by any token other than another king. (Players can choose to keep the symbols face-down and treat all tokens the same, if desired.)&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "The Last Hundred Yards Vol. 2: Airborne Over Europe is the second game in Mike Denson&rsquo;s Last Hundred Yards series. It includes two major campaigns featuring numerous missions covering small unit actions conducted by US airborne forces in the Normandy and Market Garden operations.&#10; In the Operation Overlord campaign, follow the elements of the American 82nd and 101st Divisions beyond the Normandy beachheads. After being scattered over a large area in Normandy on the night of June 6th, they struggle to assemble and secure their objectives to support the advance of the American units landing at Utah Beach. Later missions feature them defending against the inevitable German reaction and counterattack. Follow Lt. Dick Winters as he leads his platoon in taking out the artillery battery at Brecourt Manor near Ste. Marie-du-Mont and then faces a counterattack from elements of Col. Von Der Heydte&rsquo;s 6th Fallschirmj&auml;ger Regiment.&#10;&#10;In the Operation Market Garden campaign, follow the 82nd Airborne Division after landing south of Nijmegen in the early afternoon hours of September 17th as they race to secure critical bridges over the Waal and Maas rivers, as well as those over the canal between them. Follow Lt. Foley and his men as they defend Devil&rsquo;s Hill against German counterattacks on the Eiesenborne Ridge Groesbeek Heights, a mere 2-3 miles from the German Border.&#10;&#10;While the 82nd lands around Nijmegen, the 101st Airborne Division lands north of Eindhoven and begins its own race to secure its assigned bridges over the river Dommel in Eindhoven, the Wilhelmina canal in Son and Best, and the bridges over the Zuid-Willemsvaart and river AA in Veghel. Experience the counterattack by the German Kampfgruppes H&uuml;ber and Walther as they cut the main highway near Veghel. It took two critical days of hard fighting for units of 101stAirborne and British XXX Corp to reopen the corridor.&#10;&#10;This game will introduce airdrop and night rules, as well as new terrain to the series. Successfully landing airborne troops at night, assembling them from a dispersed condition, and advancing against unknown enemy resistance to secure your objectives will prove a thrilling challenge in this new game.&#10;&#10;Note: This game is a stand alone game.

During this turn, you won&rsquo;t receive damage from that row, but you won&rsquo;t get honour points.&#10;&#10;In the Enemy phase, all of the Enemies from the rows without a Deflect token on top, will attack you.

    "description": "&ldquo;All hope abandon ye who enter here. Welcome to the grimdark. Welcome to DAYNIGHTZ&trade;&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Dawn breaks on the refuge, and the sunrays bring you the feared news&hellip;the day has come, the day to go back to the city. When this damned thing started, you joined a group of survivors that had gathered in the woods, fleeing from the city. With tremendous effort, you erected a makeshift refuge to fend off the foul creatures, waiting for the army to come and save you. However, help is not coming, you know that now. And so do the traitors who quietly left the refuge last night, taking most of the remaining supplies with them. Now you are forced to go back to the city: It&rsquo;s the only option if you want to survive another day&hellip;&#10;&#10;This is the starting point of DAYNIGHTZ&trade;. You get to pick a group of up to 4 survivors, each with its own character sheet that shows its attributes and abilities, a backpack and some equipment. Now you&rsquo;re ready to start your adventure in a nightmare world, where the dead rule above the living.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;What is your goal?That depends on the game mode chosen:&#10;&#10;-&gt; In campaign mode you will have to brave narrative missions where you will have to fight and take difficult decisions, that will determine your progress, culminating in one of three possible endings.&#10;-&gt; In survival mode you will roam from city to city, with complete freedom to do whatever it takes to survive another day on this hell on earth.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;How are you going to achieve your goal?The game is divided in 3 segments: Adventure Phase, Travel Phase and Refuge Phase.&#10;&#10;1) Adventure Phase: This is the most important phase of the game. In it, players will roam the streets and alleys of the city, exploring locales, suffering encounters and generally trying to keep a low profile while striving to achieve their goals (established by the campaign mission in the campaign mode or by their own interests in the survival mode).&#10;&#10;One of the many things that set DAYNIGHTZ&trade; apart from other games is that is played on TWO LEVELS. What does that mean?&#10;&#10;On one hand there is the City board, consisting of a labyrinth of streets, alleys, surprise zones and locations. On the other hand, whenever the players want to explore a certain location, or due to the triggering of events and conditions, players will lay out tiles to represent that particular location. Each location has its own set of tiles, depending on its nature. For example, the Firemen Park location consists of the parking tile, the locker room tile and the offices tile.&#10;&#10;2) Travel Phase: Once the Adventure Phase is finished, survivors will have to trudge back to their refuge with their meager loot. In this phase survivors will have to face different situations, like zombie encounters, coming across abandoned structures (farms, etc) and being assaulted by other survivor groups.&#10;&#10;3) Refuge Phase: This is a management phase, where survivors will have to handle, upgrade and defend their base. While in the refuge survivors can do a lot of stuff: recover from their wounds/infections, level up, stock supplies, farm food, upgrade the refuge&rsquo;s defenses&hellip;The refuge, though, will be attacked regularly by either roamer&rsquo;s packs or other survivor groups, who can also steal and sabotage your base. That is more likely to happen if you&rsquo;re away for extended periods, so try to do your city supply runs as fast as possible&hellip;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;What is the core mechanic?DAYNIGHTZ&trade; is based on a double profile system, for both the zombies and the survivors: during the day, zombies use their worse profile, while during the night, zombie use their better profile and survivors will use their worse profile, unless they&rsquo;re equipped with a light source&hellip;which are obviously very scarce and run out very fast! The day and night cycle is controlled through a timetable located on the City board.&#10;&#10;On top of that, other elements can make the brave survivor&rsquo;s life even more difficult:&#10;&#10;- Threat Counter: Consists of a counter that increases as a result of diverse things happening, like survivors making noise, environmental effects, zombies amassing, etc. The higher the Threat counter, the higher the risk the survivors are taking by staying in the city.&#10;&#10;- Threat Encounters: Each end of turn you will verify the conditions stated in a card. If you meet the conditions, you will suffer a Threat encounter. That might not happen very frequently but&hellip;beware when it does happen!&#10;&#10;- The Hunter: The Hunter is the most dangerous zombie in the game. Luckily, it only appears at night; unfortunately, when it appears it will attack all the survivors who are out in the open (in streets and alleys). So keep this in mind: you don&rsquo;t want to be wandering around in the open at night!&#10;&#10;- Survivor&rsquo;s health and stress: DAYNIGHTZ&trade; is a very realistic game. Thus, the more wounded your survivor is, the more difficult it will be for him/her to accomplish actions (in combat or out of it). Also, your survivor will be able to do less actions the more wounded he/she is. Stress is also key, as your survivor will be affected by events depending on their stress level, which can also impact on their attribute checks.&#10;&#10;- Infection: Survivors can get infected when wounded by a zombies, while searching corpses or by other special effects. Once infected, the disease will deteriorate the survivor and if not treated, will end up killing him/her. Of course, the infection will be more easily neutered in its early stages; the more you wait, the harder it will be to remove it. While infected, your survivor will periodically succumb to its effects, which can make them bleed, make them slower, etc.&#10;&#10;To help them deal with the situations that they will find themselves in, the survivors can use a lot of items that they will find in their city wanderings. However, all said items will either need consumables in order to function or will wear away with use&hellip;&#10;&#10;The players will also encounter other survivors and animals during their travels, which, depending on the decisions previously taken and the success in the encounters, can join their group as allies. Allies can give a series of bonuses to the survivors, but will not remain with them forever: allies have their own loyalty system, which depends on the actions taken by the players. The way you treat them will determine how they treat you!&#10;&#10;All the points above, plus others that you will discover during gameplay, set DAYNIGHTZ&trade; apart from other zombie-themed games. We have worked really hard to achieve an immersive experience, exploring the dark themes of the zombie apocalypse, and we welcome you.&#10;&#10;PS: If you want to keep with all the info about the game, you can follow us in:&#10;&#10;",

The agents want to dissect the Visitor and keep the ship.&#10;&#10;Visitor in Blackwood Grove is an asymmetric, two-versus-many, inductive-reasoning game in which one player &mdash; the Visitor &mdash; makes up a secret rule like &quot;Things that contain metal&quot; to determine which objects can pass through the forcefield. The other players &mdash; the Agents and the Kid &mdash; try to figure out the rule by seeing which objects pass through the forcefield and which don't. The Agents secretly test cards from their hands to learn what passes the rule and what doesn't. The Kid tries to predict which cards will pass the rule, and she builds trust with the Visitor if she&rsquo;s right.&#10;&#10;The Kid and the Visitor are on a team &mdash; if the Visitor makes a rule that's too easy, the agents will solve it first and he will lose. If the Visitor makes the rule too hard, nobody will be able to solve it and the Agents will win. If the Visitor makes the rule just right, the Kid will figure it out before the agents and both the Kid and the Visitor win!&#10;&#10;Awards &amp; Honors:&#10;BostonFIG Fest // 2017 - Audience Choice Award&#10;IndieCade // 2017 Official Selection&#10;Mensa Mind Games // 2019 Finalist&#10;Indie Mega Booth PAX East // 2018 Official Selection&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "HISTORY&#10;Anno Domini 1482. For the past few centuries, the Iberian Peninsula has been a complex battlefield of crossed interests, kings' ambitions and noblemen's intrigues. The Muslim power, once uncontested under Cordoba's Caliphate banners, lies languidly in the last Moor stronghold in Al-Andalus, the marvellous city of Granada.&#10;The last rulers of the Alhambra (&ldquo;The Red One&rdquo;) have been buying peace from the powerful Christian kingdoms for decades. Weakened by internal family divisions, they now face their darkest nightmare: a nuptial union between Castille and Arag&oacute;n in the figures of Isabel I of Castille and Ferdinand II of Aragon, the Catholic Monarchs.&#10;Through cunning diplomacy and negotiations, large armies are congregating to push to the sea the last Muslim presence in Western Europe. The Pope promulgates the last Crusade and military orders join the mixed army of Castille and Aragon, along with mercenaries all over Europe. The Nasrid Kingdom tries to gather its men and garrisons, sending messengers to North Africa for military support and reinforcing the numerous castles and watchtowers all over its lands.&#10;But deception and treason will play their part (Ferdinand II will be the main inspiration for Machiavelli's &rdquo;The Prince&rdquo;). Boabdil is conspiring to reach the throne in the city of the pomegranates whereas his uncle, el Zagal, is well known for his hit-and-run ambushes and guerrilla warfare. Will Catholic Monarchs be able to consolidate their dream of a united Iberian realm to continue towards world-wide domination? Will the Nasrid Kingdom accept the challenge and fight in a stubborn resistance until it breaks its enemies' will to continue the fight?&#10;&#10;GAME FEATURES&#10;Granada: The Last Stand of the Moors, is a game for two players in which they will decide the outcome of this decisive historical episode in less than 4 hours.&#10;Units are represented by blocks depicting their strength but also their origin: Castilians, Aragoneses, Leoneses and mercenaries for the Catholic player, and different clans like Banu Sarray, Zegr&iacute;es, Banu Bannigas and proper Nasrids for the Muslim player.&#10;The map is point-to-point, covering the ancient Nasrid Kingdom in southeast Iberia (present-day Spain). Granada, the capital, is the jewel of the realm: the game ends if it falls into the Catholic player's hands.&#10;Each season, players receive a predetermined number of cards which they can use to move their armies and fleets or rally new units. When a battle occurs, each regiment is summoned by the play of one card of its nationality, so as Tamerlan said: &rdquo;It is better to be present with 100 soldiers than absent with 1.000.&rdquo; In other words, be sure you have the right cards to send your troops into battle.&#10;As an almost Renaissance war, different weapons will also be present. Cavalry charges and crossbows will be extremely dangerous if well combined, whereas artillery will have a significant value when maintaining or defending sieges. Your fleets will fight for sea control, enabling the transport of North African reinforcements, Catholic naval movements or blocking sieged ports.&#10;Balanced and historically accurate, the game is easy to learn but difficult to master. The Catholic player will have to decide which invasion route to choose and whether he will create a massive army, leaving the Muslim player time to reinforce his strongholds, or go for a quick campaign where losses will be difficult to replace. The Nasrid player, on the other hand, will enjoy a central position but he will need to be cautious about the internal problems that can arise&mdash; the Boabdil revolt is almost an inevitable danger to face and crush.&#10;&#10;As the Catholic player, will you gain fame and glory accomplishing the Reconquista and enlarging your kingdoms in one unified powerful state? And as the Muslim player, will you resist and save Granada or will you become the last King of the Nasrid dynasty?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;Time scale: 1 year per 2-player turn&#10;Map scale: Point to point&#10;Unit scale: One block = 500-1500 soldiers&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&bull; 22&rdquo; x 34&rdquo;&nbsp;Mounted map&nbsp;&nbsp;&#10;&bull; 137 Rectangular blocks in various colors&nbsp;&#10;&bull; 11 rectangular tiles&#10;&bull; 2  Sheets of stickers (for blocks)&nbsp;&#10;&bull; 2  Draw bags&nbsp;&#10;&bull; 20 square castles (10 white, 10 black)&#10;&bull; 20 round watchtowers (10 white, 10 black)&#10;&bull; 26 small cubes (13 white, 13 black)&#10;&bull; 7  Wooden markers (various sizes and colors)&#10;&bull; 3&nbsp; Decks of cards (74 Christians, 67 Muslims, 17 Naval)&#10;&bull; 1  Victory Points track&#10;&bull; 2  Player Aids and 2 Battle Reference Cards (identical)&#10;&bull; 1  Rules booklet&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;GRANADA: &#10;&quot;El &uacute;ltimo baluarte de los Moros&quot; es un juego para dos jugadores que representa la campa&ntilde;a entre 1482 y 1492, durante el reinado de los Reyes Cat&oacute;licos Isabel I de Castilla y Fernando II de Arag&oacute;n, contra el Emirato de Granada de la dinast&iacute;a nazar&iacute;. Como Isabel se hab&iacute;a casado con Fernando en 1469, esto significaba que los dos poderosos reinos de Castilla y Arag&oacute;n ahora permanecer&iacute;an unidos, libres de la guerra entre reinos cristianos que hab&iacute;a ayudado a Granada a sobrevivir. Este per&iacute;odo marc&oacute; el final del dominio musulm&aacute;n independiente en la Pen&iacute;nsula Ib&eacute;rica y la captura final de tierras ocupadas por los primeros invasores musulmanes desde el a&ntilde;o 711. La conquista de Granada bajo Fernando e Isabel reflej&oacute; la modernizaci&oacute;n de la guerra que se produjo en toda Europa en el siglo XV. En particular, el ej&eacute;rcito de ambos monarcas era m&aacute;s grande y estaba compuesto por mucha m&aacute;s infanter&iacute;a que los ej&eacute;rcitos cruzados anteriores en tierras peninsulares y despleg&oacute; eficazmente artiller&iacute;a de asedio para asaltar las otrora inexpugnables defensas y murallas de Granada. Fernando emergi&oacute; de la Cruzada con un ej&eacute;rcito moderno y bien adiestrado que estaba bajo su autoridad, no la autoridad dispersa t&iacute;pica de las levas feudales.&#10;Este juego tiene una gran deuda con Sekigahara: La unificaci&oacute;n de Jap&oacute;n (GMT) del dise&ntilde;ador  Matt Calkins. Debe considerarse como un tributo a ese gran dise&ntilde;o.",

At the beginning of the game, everyone makes an ambiguous clay sculpture called a Cluzzle. For the rest of the game, players ask &ldquo;Yes or No&rdquo; questions to figure out the other clay puzzles.&#10;&#10;You don&rsquo;t have to be an artist to play. In fact, the longer it takes others to figure out your clay sculpture, the more points you get. However, you only get points if at least one person figures out your Cluzzle before the end of the game. This means you&rsquo;ll want your sculpture to be a little ambiguous, but not too ambiguous.&#10;&#10;And this is exactly where the humor lies! The result is a hilarious game for all ages, where anyone can win and everyone will have fun. So grab your friends and family. Your ridiculously poor sculptures will inspire laughter that will be remembered for years to come!&#10;&#10;Did you know that Alanis Morissette, Alan Moon, Stephen Glenn, Tom Vasel, and others created personalized Cluzzle Cards for the game? You can learn why the objects they chose are personal to them on the North Star Games website.&#10;&#10;Cluzzle was modeled after a 1988 Klaus Teuber game called Barbarossa.

Actions include: taking first pick of actions next round, rearranging ships' pieces (x4), placing bets on ships (x2), adding supplies to a ship (x2), increasing the value of supplies in the market, or setting sail.&#10;&#10;When a ship sets sail, players will share its supplies in order of how many times their clan's shield appears on the body pieces of that ship. Starting with the player with the most shields, players will claim a supply token of their choice from the bow of the ship and place it facedown on their scoring circle. These supply tokens will score points based on their value in the market at the end of the game. Additionally, if a player placed a bet on the clan that had majority control of the ship, then they take their winning bet and place it facedown on their scoring circle.&#10;&#10;The game ends after seven ships have set sail. Players calculate their final scores by adding together the value of their supply tokens with the value of their winning bets. The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

Each player assumes the role of one of a matched pair of gladiators pitted in a contest of arms to the death. Superbly trained and equipped for the sole purpose of entertaining the citizenry with their life and death struggles, each man must fight with all the skill  he can muster for his very survival. There is no question of bravery in the arena. It is kill or be killed and each man must muster all the skills and cunning he can summon in this most desperate of battles for survival. There can be only one victor in the arena and few second chances for the loser, for missus can be granted the fallen only at the whim of the emperor. And all too often mercy takes the form of a quick end on an opponent's blade. Let the games begin!&#10;&#10;To begin a game you select a gladiator with a set of ratings which determine his various fighting skills.  With simultaneous movement, achieved through pre-plotted moves, you then attempt to gain a positional advantage against your adversary. Once in striking range you must then decide on a combination of attacks and defensive measures to weaken, wound or kill your opponent.&#10;&#10;Heavy gladiators are equipped with a shield and considerable armour, while lights may come protected by a few select pieces of armour.  A lightly armoured retarius, employing a net and trident, poses a different set of challenges and strategies.&#10;&#10;If your fate comes down to a decision by the Emperor, just hope that you put on a sufficiently exciting show for the crowd.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "-From Plaay.com website:&#10;&#10;&quot;RED WHITE &amp; BLUE RACIN' sports simulation board game offers a unique way of re-creating a pro stock car race. Instead of tediously checking every car, every lap, the game uses a &quot;highlight reel&quot; method of generating exciting race action. You get right to &quot;good stuff!&quot; NO math exercises or constant index calculations and re-calculations--this game is NOT about crunching numbers. It's about high-octane thrills and super-charged race day drama! The result? A full race in as little as 45 minutes, packed with everything fans love about big-time pro stock car racing!&#10;&#10;&quot;RED WHITE &amp; BLUE RACIN' offers an assortment of different stock car experiences. The game comes with an &quot;all star&quot; set of driver cards representing stars of the past decade. For an additional charge, you can purchase a set of cards based specifically on last year's racing season, including everyone from the champion in the point standings to the drivers who ran only a race or two, and track cards for every racing venue at which a points race was held. There's also a &quot;Stars of the 1980s&quot; card set, allowing you to revive memories of racing's exciting past. Or create your OWN pro racing universe with a card set from our fictional pro stock car circuit, Stock Car Racing America--or SCRAM for short!&quot;&#10;&#10;RW&amp;B Racin' allows you to play through a race, including qualifying, with the use of 6 dice and a game chart.  Each turn a section of drivers, top, middle or bottom will be &quot;highlighted&quot; and drivers from the group will get a chance to move up in the race or maybe even take the lead!  But along with the excitment of the race comes &quot;trouble&quot; which can lead to a trip to the pits or even taking a driver out of the race.&#10;&#10;Utilizing a simple yet elegant system, each driver is rating on gas (passing), brake (defending against getting passed) as well as 6 racing skills.  Also represented is how good a driver is at qualifying as well as how good the pit crew is at fixing the damage along the way.  It is a quick system to learn, but you will be amazed at how it captures the essence of stock car racing.&#10;&#10;For more information and for a more detailed description of a couple of turns, check out the Plaay.com website.&#10;&#10;",

You have two choices on your turn: Take over a trick by playing a equal or higher card or you must play your lowest card. It is not enough to keep a low card in your hand for the last trick as you will also need some high cards for taking over key tricks.&#10;&#10;The player who wins the final (seventh) trick screwed up and must take cucumbers. Each player collects their cucumbers at the end of a round, and if a player has more than five cucumbers, he is out of the game; five cucumbers is the most you can have! In this way more and more players are excluded from the game until the final two are playing for victory!&#10;&#10;Five Cucumbers is a modern variant of the trick-taking game Cucumber (Agurk, Gurka), which is well-known primarily in Scandinavia.

    "description": "It is 1862 and the US Congress has decreed that a railroad be built that will span the continent - linking the east coast and the west coast by rail for the first time.  The Transcontinental Railroad will be a epic feat of engineering - combining advanced construction techniques with raw human power and determination.  A fortune is to be made for those who can build the track the fastest!  Your task is to build an efficient team of workers, plan out your route and race the other players to connect both coasts first!&#10;&#10;In Pacific Rails Inc., players are the Presidents of rival railway companies.  Using worker placement and resource management, players compete to build a continuous track from one side of the board to the other.  When the two sides meet, the end of the game is triggered and glory await those who have built the best railway.&#10;&#10;The core mechanic of the game is worker placement.  On your turn, you either place a worker onto an action, or remove an existing worker.  If you place adjacent to one of your own workers, your actions are powered up.  Planning out a sequence of action is vital to get the best results.  Keep an eye on the other players and try to block them if they are building up to a super move.&#10;&#10;You are also building up your team during the game.  Your engine starts with just the foreman.  You can hire extra Specialists to your train that allow you to build more track, lobby Congress and give you powerful actions.  Add in some carriage bonuses and you are on the way to creating a powerful engine that will allow powerful actions to be chained together producing epic turns that will show your mastery of the rails!&#10;&#10;Once you have your track ready, you need to plan out the best route.  You need to have the tracks ready to match the terrain you wish to cover and decide which cities to connect and which to skip.  You must be able to complete a connection to the next city in one action - so make sure you're not missing any tracks!  Also watch what your rivals are up to - points are on offer if you can get them to use your connected cities.&#10;&#10;In addition to the fun game play, Pacific Rails Inc has amazing art by Damien Mammoliti, well known for his work on the games Brass, Nocturion, and more.  From the box cover all the way to the game board, the artwork is highly-detailed and beautifully crafted.&#10;&#10;",

First the players will draft Project cards that offer the Projects that they will have access to. Then, on a player&rsquo;s turn, he can complete one of his own Projects, one of the Standard Projects, or pass. When both players have passed, the Generation is over and players collect income to begin the next Generation.&#10;&#10;When the supply of at least 2 of the 3 types of parameters have been exhausted or there are no vacant hexes on the map, that Generation will be the final Generation of the game.

    "description": "India's railroad history began in 1837 when The Red Hill Railway used the country's first steam-powered locomotive to carry stone for road work to Madras, modern-day Chennai. In 1845, India's first railway was incorporated, the Madras Railway. Sixteen years later, on a warm April day in 1853, a 14-carriage train carrying 400 passengers was hauled 21 miles by three steam locomotives - the Sahib, Sindh, and Sultan - and passenger railway service was thus initiated in India. From there, as they say, the rest is history, and India today has the world's fourth-largest railway network.&#10;&#10;18 India is an operational railroad game for 2 to 5 people that plays in about 3 hours. The game is inspired by 1829 Mainline by Francis Tresham, and while the venerable Mr. Tresham created some novel mechanics for that game, many of them are not ideal for players that eschew in-game randomness. In 18 India, those random elements are transformed into an amazing level of pre-game variability, which gives each session of the game a different character.&#10;&#10;",

Using a quick-playing, card-driven game system, each player assumes the role of a French soldier -- or grognard -- starting out as a young sergeant or sous-lieutenant trying to make it in life beginning in 1792. Fortunately for the enterprising grognard, he can look forward to over twenty years of almost continuous war provided courtesy of the Directory and Napol&eacute;on!&#10;&#10;Game play is broken down into a series of campaign seasons that span the period from the Brunswick Manifesto in 1792 to The Hundred Days of 1815. Each campaign season consists of a number of 'In Garrison' rounds and 'On Campaign' rounds. During these rounds, major historical events take place, from the arrest and execution of Louis XVI to the coronation of Napol&eacute;on, from great battles to the &quot;whiff of grapeshot.&quot; History is fixed, with events happening like they actually did, that is, with one exception: will the English christen that climactic battle of 1815 The Battle of Waterloo or will the victorious French name it La Bataille de Mont Saint Jean?!&#10;&#10;Against this historical backdrop, grognards take advantage of the opportunities that Fate provides to advance their station in life. Will you be lucky enough to be assigned to the Army of the Orient with Napol&eacute;on himself or will you be marooned in the Army of the Rhine et Moselle? Will you exhibit reckless bravery under the Emperor&rsquo;s eye at Austerlitz, or will you sit out the 1805 campaign, recovering from wounds suffered in a pointless minor skirmish? It&rsquo;s both up to you and to Fate. Each grognard has a number of qualities that are key to game play:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Rank: From Sergent to Marechal (is there a baton in your knapsack?)&#10;     Title and Office: Reserved only for the most senior grognards&#10;     Legion of Honor: Has your bravery been suitably recognized?&#10;     Napol&eacute;on&rsquo;s Notice: You can&rsquo;t command a regiment without this&#10;     Glory: Are you known as a bold fire-eater, forever brave?&#10;     Money: Has fortune shined on you in more tangible ways?&#10;     Health: Will the predations of war force you into retirement?&#10;     Charm: Of course; this is a game about Frenchmen, n'est pas?&#10;     Fencing: Useful for skewering a fellow grognard who insults you&#10;     Standing: Does your commander hold you in high esteem or contempt?&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Play:&#10;Winning the game is achieved in a number of ways: having the highest award in the Legion of Honor, having the highest military rank, or having the most glory or wealth. The game is entirely suitable for  solitaire play through six players (and perhaps even a few more). Legion of Honor consists of two short scenarios of 4 hours each that cover the Republican Period and the Imperial Period. The grand scenario spans both periods and takes 8 hours to play.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "15,000 B.C. &ndash; a great ice age is ending. Another titanic struggle for global supremacy has unwittingly commenced between the animal species.&#10;&#10;Dominant Species: The Card Game is a fast-playing game that abstractly recreates a tiny portion of ancient history: the ponderous rescinding of an ice age and what that entails for the living creatures trying to adapt to the slowly-changing earth.&#10;&#10;Players will use six major animal classes &ndash; mammal, reptile, bird, amphibian, arachnid or insect &ndash; to further their goals in various terrain. Through wily card play, players will strive to become dominant at as many different terrestrial and sea biomes as possible in order to claim valuable victory points: It is survival of the fittest.&#10;&#10;All of this leads to the end game &ndash; the final descent of the ice age &ndash; where the player who has accumulated the most victory points wins the game.&#10;&#10;But somebody better become dominant quickly because it's getting mighty warm...&#10;&#10;Dominant Species: The Card Game consists of ten rounds of competition, each round occurring on ten of the twelve different Biome cards. The player who starts a competition must choose to either play one Action card or pass.&#10;&#10;Action cards consist of animals played to the table as well as events. Animals contribute their Food Chain values towards gaining valuable victory points at the various Biomes, and use their element icons to fight for control of the six Element resource cards. Animals can also sometimes suppress other animals, turning them from Healthy to Endangered, or Endangered to Extinct. Event cards can be powerful one-time effects or ongoing effects that last throughout the round.&#10; Play proceeds clockwise around the table in like fashion until every player has passed consecutively or when any one player has passed with an empty hand. At that point Element cards and the current Biome card are scored, with victorious players recording their gains on the Victory Point Track. If the competition is at a Tundra, one or more dominant players will advance one space on the Survival Track.&#10;&#10;The current Biome card as well as all played Action cards are then discarded, and a new Biome card brought into play. Finally, each player draws (and perhaps discards) new Action cards based on his position on the Survival Track, and a new competition round begins. Play proceeds from Biome to Biome in like fashion until the game ends and a winner is determined.&#10;&#10;Reimplements&#10;&#10;    Dominant Species&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Each player competes to be the first to successfully guide his animal through the dream world.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with a grid of 25 tiles, set up at random in a 5x5 dreamscape. Each player also starts with one extra tile, with a picture of their animal on it. The opposite side of all dreamscape tiles also has a picture of the animal. Each turn, a random card is drawn, telling players which tile they should flip. When a player flips a tile, it means their animal is traveling through a part of the dreamscape. Each player's goal is to guide their animal through the dreamscape by positioning him in a specified pattern (which is different each game).  After a card is drawn, a player takes their extra animal and slides him into the dreamscape, shifting one row or column of tiles until a new, different tile emerges from the opposite side.  The player will use this tile to shift another column or row on the next turn, and so on, until one player's dreamscape tiles match the goal.  The player then shouts their animal's name-- &quot;Dingo!&quot;, for example, to win the round.&#10;&#10;Advanced rules add Hazard Tokens which increase the challenge substantially: to complete the required dream pattern, the player may not have his animal in any of the Hazard spaces marked on the dream card.&#10;&#10;",

Pick-a-Seal will be launched in Essen 2014.&#10;&#10;The nanuks are determined not to be sitting &quot;bears&quot; due to global warming. Sourcing a supply of canned fish may be a way to survive the diminishing sea ice &mdash; and if nothing else, it gives them a good reason to travel all the way from the North Pole to Germany to party down with their doggie friends there!&#10;&#10;Pick-a-Polar Bear, first published as Formissimo, features the same gameplay as Pick-a-Dog but with two new variants! To set up the basic game, lay out 30 cards in a grid and give one card face down to each player. Each card has five attributes, with each attribute having two states: large/small, with/without a raised arm, orange autumn/blue winter background, with/without goggles, and with/without canned fish. Someone shouts &quot;Go!&quot;, then everyone looks at their card in hand. Players then start grabbing cards from the grid and stacking them in hand. The card grabbed must be identical to the top card in hand or differ from that top card in only one way. Thus, as you grab cards, the attributes of that top card will keep changing, forcing you to look for matches in new ways.&#10;&#10;Once a player thinks he can't grab any more cards, he yells &quot;Stop!&quot; The round ends, and all players check their card stacks. If someone made a mistake when grabbing cards, that player keeps none of the cards gathered that round. If the player who stopped the round made no mistakes, he earns an extra card. If, however, he stopped the round when he could have collected more cards, then he loses all the cards he's collected during this round.&#10;&#10;To set up for the next round, give each player a new face-down card and fill in the holes in the grid. When the deck runs out, complete that round, after which the game ends. Whoever has collected the most cards wins!&#10;&#10;Pick-a-Polar Bear includes two game variants. In the first, the player who has obtained the most cards in the preceding round cannot grab a card that's identical to his top card in the current round. For the second variant, shuffle eight &quot;bonus round&quot; cards into the deck. If when laying out the cards in the grid, the dealer reveals the back of a bonus round card when at least ten cards are on the table, everyone prepares for the bonus round. The dealer reveals this card, which shows two card elements such as upraised arm and goggles, and everyone races to yell out how many cards in the grid feature these two elements. Whoever yells out the correct answer first receives the bonus round card, which is worth 2 points; whoever yells out the wrong answer takes a -2 point penalty card. The dealer then continues filling the grid. (If the grid contains fewer than ten cards when a bonus round card comes up in the deck, discard this card and continue to fill the grid.)&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "As the many planes of existence turn and churn, occasionally worlds come into alignment.  For brief moments in the multiverse's timescale, these Conjunctions allow objects to slip from one world to another, sometimes unnoticed, sometimes causing chaos.&#10;&#10;One such Conjunction occurred between Earth and Neemoss, during the Dark Ages.  Two dimensions could not be more different.  Physics in this alternate plane is more akin to magic and its corrupting effects create worlds of monsters and cruelty.  When items from Neemoss appear on Earth they are still imbued with their magical essence, which is soon discovered by healers, alchemists, fakirs and all manner of snake-oil peddlers.  But things become decidedly worse when the Conjunction strengthens and the first Witches from Neemoss cross into our plane of existence.&#10;&#10;Help the Heroes master their newfound magical powers as they defend their lands from the malevolent Witches and the disciples they summon. Or control the Witches as they complete their rituals to ravage the Earth!&#10;&#10;Dark Rituals: Malleus Maleficarum is an asymmetric &ldquo;One vs Many&rdquo; miniatures board game for 2 to 5 players with an expansion for a solo mode where one player controls the Witch Master. In &quot;one vs many&quot;, a team of people control a small band of Heroes defending villagers from a single player controlling the vile Forces of Evil.  All players manage a pool of stamina that is used to pay for their character&rsquo;s actions.  Game play is dynamic with little downtime: turns alternate between the two forces with a player on each side taking one or two actions each turn, so long as they still have stamina.&#10;&#10;Play is organized around scenarios with unique objectives.  The scenarios can be linked into a longer campaign or played individually if your group is more casual. Story driven scenarios, game mechanics, detailed miniatures and lush modular boards bring the game world to life.&#10;&#10;Can you use the magic of Neemoss to defeat the invading horde? Or will you complete your Dark Rituals to summon the ultimate evil?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Players are knights seeking to perform a particular quest (varies with each knight) in order to win the game.  Exploration and adventure are created by the game board being made up of randomly placed tiles which are uncovered as the knights reach them.  Tiles can be fixed locations or glades where a randomly chosen role card can reveal a spell or a denizen.  Denizens act in different ways, depending upon its nature or the throw of a die.  Some help the knights, others hinder.  Players compete against each other, but can also work together to defeat a denizen.  The first knight to complete his or her quest and exit the Mystic Wood wins the game.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;     The Mystic Wood Extension Kit&#10;&#10;&#10;",
