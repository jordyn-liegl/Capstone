    "description": "Take charge of your clan from the Scottish high country. In each round, a player first builds up his clan and landholdings, and then optionally conducts a raid on an opponent.&#10;&#10;You start by pulling six cubes from a bag. With green cubes you increase your ministers and potential to gain VPs at the end of a round. Yellow cubes attract warriors and permit you to hold more battle cards. The blue cubes are &quot;pipers&quot; used for combat support or possible VP generation. A blue cube can also be played as a &quot;bard&quot; to lure away opponents' followers. Finally, there are the red cubes, which represent cattle and generate VPs. You also use cubes to create new estates, where you can deposit cattle and groups of cubes (which are safer than those not on an estate).&#10;&#10;Raids are resolved simply. In three battle-rounds a card of value one to four is played by the two opponents; this value can be increased by a single blue cube. The one who wins the most battle-rounds wins the fight. The loser will then lose cubes while the victor gains a VP or two.&#10;&#10;After each round there is a valuation, in which the VPs are determined based on number of cubes. For example, the player with the most green cubes gets 3 VPs, while second most gets 2 VPs; if two players are tied for most, each gets only 1 VP. Another example: each red cattle tile is worth a VP, but if one player has the most he gets a 2 VP bonus.&#10;&#10;The estate tiles contain a number on the back. After each round a panel is turned. If the leading player has at least as many points as the number of the tile, the game ends.&#10;&#10;Bottom line: a fast game offering something for everyone: luck, tactics, and lots of interaction with your fellow players.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Ares Magazine #9. Delta Vee is a tactical simulation of combat among spaceships in the 24th Century. The game is intended for two players, although more may participate in scenarios devised by the players. Each hex on the Delta Vee game maps represents a volume 20,000 kilometers in diameter. The game uses a two-dimensional movement system; the &ldquo;plane&rdquo; of the playing area represents the ecliptic of the star system in which each battle occurs. Each Game-Turn represents 15 minutes.&#10;&#10;During play, each player moves one or more spaceships about the game-map using a maneuver system that abstractly simulates the laws of Newtonian motion. Each spaceship is composed of a hull with a varying number of attached pods. Each pod represents a system that improves the ship&rsquo;s capabilities in combat, movement, and/or some other aspect of spaceship operations.&#10;&#10;Each player controls his spaceships by issuing Maneuver Commands (so that the ship may alter its velocity or direction of movement) and Battle Commands (so that weapons and other systems aboard the ship may be prepared for use). A spaceship&rsquo;s combat abilities include laser fire, particle fire, four types of missiles, and battle craft (two man fighter craft launched from larger ships). The attributes of each spaceship are recorded on a Spaceship Log before beginning play. During the game, energy expended, missiles launched, and damage incurred by the ship are recorded on the ship&rsquo;s log.&#10;&#10;Delta Vee is the tactical space combat system for SPI&rsquo;s science fiction role-playing game, Universe. Although there is little open warfare in the vast human interstellar empire of the 24th Century (contact with another space-faring race has yet to be established), there are many types of illegal ship traffic and disputes among self-governing worlds. These types of small conflicts form the background for the scenarios in Delta Vee.&#10;&#10;",

Her carnival costume (wooden pieces) are hidden in a large cloth bag. They fit on the game board in pre-determined ways. Each turn, the players simultaneously reach into the bag to find the next matching puzzle piece. The winner is the player who places the most pieces.&#10;&#10;Ramba Samba demands tactile awareness in a fun-filled way.

During the journey players must play the right cards from their limited hand to avoid obstacles placed before them by their opponents.  Of course, having possession of the singular Blue Amulet allows a player to ignore many of these obstacles without needing the appropriate card.  Players can also maneuver their pawns (through the use of movement cards) in such a way as to bump their opponents onto a path going in the wrong direction.&#10;&#10;The board is beautifully illustrated and the game won the Spiel des Jahres award for Most Beautiful Game in 1986.&#10;&#10;Das Blaue Amulett is the second game in Noris' Fantasy trilogy, with Die Drei Magier and Der Feuersalamander being the first and third.&#10;&#10;",

Players will collect cards and treasure, move guards, and hide within the city of Constantinople until they find their time to strike. Combat is handled through cardplay, and the player who best manages his cards will have the best chance at victory.&#10;&#10;At the start of each player's turn, he draws an Event card, which can spawn new targets in the outer city, move guards, or allow you to find a tunnel to another section of the city. Moving guards is a great way to get them away from you and place them near your opponents. Targets cannot be assassinated while a guard is nearby, but fortunately the guards can be dispatched if need be.&#10;&#10;Cards in hand drive the action, but they are also your hit points. If you run out of cards in hand, you die &mdash; but just like in a video game, you will soon respawn at your starting area. Moving and attacking targets (or your fellow players) requires playing cards, so doing too much all at once can be risky. Couple that with trying to avoid the guards and you are in for a tension-filled game of cat-and-mouse. To replenish your hand, complete objectives on your movement cards or hide. Hiding in the outer city is easy and grants you lots of extra cards. When you enter the merchant district or the area around the palace, there just aren&rsquo;t as many places to hide and you will not draw many cards.&#10;&#10;Combat is handled through cardplay. No dice are required, although a six-sided die is included to resolve some guard movement. Do you save your best cards for movement or to go in for the kill? He who risks the most has the chance for the most reward!&#10;&#10;",

The first down marker is placed 10 yards forward.

The defensive player makes his three moves after the offensive player. Once the defensive player has made his three moves, the offensive player moves once again. Play continues until the ball carrier is tackled, a team scores or an incomplete pass is thrown. In order to tackle the ball carrier, the defensive player must land one of his men on the square occupied by the ball carrier.

They take turns playing cards for themselves and their partners with trump shifting when they cannot follow suit. Cards are worth their face value (0 to 10), but tricks cost 20 points!

As long as the played cards are lower, the pile continues to grow. As soon as a card higher in value than the initial card is played, that player sweeps the entire pile. Cards from 1 to 6 score their value, 7 to 10 are worth nothing. After the last card is played, you score for the cards you collected plus the cards your left hand opponent collected. Highest score wins.&#10;&#10;The Third Man: an outrageous bidding game for 4 players&#10;The game consists of a series of auctions, for each of which the house puts up a prize fund of 10 points. Highest bidder gets the 10 points, less the number he had bid (ex. if he bid 9, he earns 1). The second highest bidder loses the full amount he had bid (ex. if he bid 7 he loses 7). Whereas the third highest bidder receives from the house double the number he had bid (if he bid 5, he pockets 10!).

As is typical of dice games of this type, the player rolls the dice and may set aside rolled dice for scoring.  The player may choose to stop rolling or continue rolling dice as long as a green flag is rolled on the flag dice.  The flag dice is rolled each time the dice are rolled.  If a different colored flag is rolled (yellow, red or black), the player's turn ends and the final score is modified (possibly down to zero) by the flag showing on the flag die when the turn ends.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "In the late summer of 1777, the British master plan to sever New England from the rest of the rebellious American colonies had come unhinged, leaving John Burgoyne's Northern Army dangerously isolated. In an attempt to break through American defenses to reach Albany, New York, Burgoyne launched his army at the American defenses on Bemis Heights. An American screen dispatched by Benedict Arnold clashed with the British advance in deep woods, triggering an afternoon-long fight fed by reinforcements for both sides. The battle ended in stalemate, as good as a defeat for Burgoyne, but might have tipped in his favor.&#10;&#10;Saratoga uses the simplified QuickPlay version of the Musket &amp; Saber system of warfare during the muzzle-loading era. Combat is based on unit quality rather than raw numbers, and rewards use of historical tactics. All units are susceptible to rout when weakened, so players must maintain reserves. Leaders enhance unit capabilities. Special rules cover the characteristics of eighteenth century warfare, especially the emergence of light infantry, and the differences between regulars and militia. Winning the battle depends on deployment, thoughtful maneuver to concentrate at the key points, the proper coordination of arms, careful use of leaders and special units, and an understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of each army.&#10;&#10;Scale:&#10;&#10;     Level: Battalion/Brigade&#10;     Hex: 352 yards&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The game board features six tracks, 6-10 spaces long worth 2-4 points, with a food space at the end of each track.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player rolls six dice, then can reroll a number of dice equal to his total of active ants on the board. After rerolling, if the player has achieved a straight of at least four dice, he can attack another player's ant(s), pushing them back on the tracks. Longer straights equal more attacks, and two attacks are needed to dislodge an ant in the valuable food spaces.&#10;&#10;After attacking, the player chooses all dice of one value and moves an ant forward on the track of that number equal to the number of dice chosen. Land on another ant, and it's trapped beneath you. Land on the food space, and you have earned the points shown there &ndash; points you can lose if someone attacks you later.&#10;&#10;If you don't like what you rolled (and rerolled), you can skip the attack and movement phase to take a Queen token. On a later turn, you can hand in a Queen to make an extra attack, gain an additional reroll, or move two ants on different tracks. A player can hold only one Queen token.&#10;&#10;As soon as one player holds 6-9 food points, with the total depending on the number of players, that player instantly wins.&#10;&#10;",

One player starts in the corner and moves the tube. If it goes over an empty space, the disc falls and occupies the place. The other player can choose to then take this tube, or start with the other, so removing the starting advantage. The players then continue to move their tubes around, until one gets 11 discs down for the win. The tubes can be moved orthogonally or diagonally any distance, but not jump or turn corners.&#10;&#10;Reportedly a good abstract game and a clever physical mechanism.&#10;&#10;",

Four times per card.&#10;&#10;If after the first check we have a 1 card and a 6, then the 1 card wins the trick.&#10;&#10;So now all keep the winning trick cards and we are ready for phase 2.&#10;&#10;Phase 2 is Russian roulette, a game of chance. We have 6 cards (bullet cards) in the middle of the table, as a revolver. 5 &quot;Clic&quot; cards and one with a bullet...&#10;&#10;On your turn (beginning with the player with the most cards from phase one):&#10;You can draw a card (pull the trigger) or you can discard one card from that you collect before, to shuffle all open bullet cards back together and then draw one, you just spin the cylinder of the revolver, (no point to do it if you have to draw the first bullet)&#10;or you can discard as many cards as alive players in the game to pass your turn to the next player. Finally, you can also choose to reveal two consecutive open bullet cards: If you survive, you'll be able to steal cards from other players!&#10;&#10;When you draw we check if you die or live from the bullet card.&#10;If you stay alive the game continues to the next player. If you die we shuffle the bullet cards and continue with the player with most cards.&#10;&#10;Last man standing is the winner.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The central hex is known as the throne; most Agon boards feature alternating colors of hexes in rings, starting from the six hexes surrounding the throne. Each player has one queen piece and six guard pieces. These all have alternating starting positions on the board's outer ring. Players take turns moving their pieces forward (or laterally) towards the center of the board; pieces may be captured by an opponent, if they are surrounded on two sides in a straight line. The captured player must then relocate his piece to the outer ring of the board. To win the game, a player must have his queen on the throne and surrounded by all six of his guards.&#10;&#10;",

The chips are the main way that players score, but their worth fluctuates constantly.  On a turn, a player draws a card and then proposes a vote, and this continues until the End card is drawn.&#10;&#10;A winner of the 1999 Concours International de Cr&#195;&#169;ateurs de Jeux de Soci&#195;&#169;t&#195;&#169;.&#10;&#10;",

Each player is in command of forces in order to defend his race and expand the control in the universe. Three races (Numan, Slurr and Uthron, most commonly distinguished between humans, aliens and robots) fight for the galaxy on different battlefields: uncharted lands, seas of planets and in the cold space.&#10;The game's goal is destroying the opponent's &quot;headquarters&quot; by reducing to zero his command points (same as life points). To achieve this, players have 330 cards between units, supports and locations in order to build their own forces deck to use in battle against opponents, in the locations determined by each player. EverZone introduces a revolutionary game mechanism to minimize random elements, creating extremely tactical challenges.&#10;&#10;EverZone ist ein strategisches Kartenspiel, das in einer fernen Zukunft spielt. Jeder Spieler kontrolliert Truppen, um seine Spezies zu verteidigen und seine Kontrolle im Universum auszuweiten.

Um das zu erreichen, baut jeder Spieler aus 330 Karten mit &quot;Units&quot;, &quot;Supports&quot; und &quot;Locations&quot; sein eigenes Deck, das er dann im Kampf gegen seine Gegner an den Schaupl&auml;tzen einsetzt, die von den Spielern bestimmt werden. Das Novum an EverZone sind Mechanismen, die die Spielstrategie auf h&ouml;chste Level anheben und den Zufallsfaktor auf ein Minimum reduzieren.&#10;&#10;",

After the active player pushes in the character wands, each opponent secretly places either a &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; token in hand, then they reveal them simultaneously. If the active player was right, she gains two scoring tokens while each opponent who guessed &quot;yes&quot; earns one; if she's wrong, then each opponent who guessed &quot;no&quot; earns one token.

    "description": "War, the Brazilian Risk-like game is making 35 years and to celebrate that they're releasing this new light wargame: War - Imp&eacute;rio Romano takes the same mechanics to a new level. This game focus on shorter game length than its predecessor and allows for less players (3 or 4 in this version, compared to 3 to 6 in the original version).&#10;&#10;From the official rules manual (in portuguese):&#10;The Roman empire was one of the greatest and longest empires in history. It started before the birth of Christ (B.C.) and lasted, in the East, until year 476 A.D. (anno domini) and, in the West, until 1453 A.D. Let us go back to year 140 D.C., when this Empire reached its greatest extension and dominated practically all Europe, part of Asia and northern Africa. Times that were not completely peaceful, for enemies threatened the borders of the empire and the conquered people insurrected against domination, seeking freedom. Go back in time with War: Roman Empire and feel the thrill of defending your borders and advancing your legions, conquering provinces of the roman world in 140 A.D.! Observe, though, that the political division of the provinces adopted in the board objectives to ease the game mechanics, and not portrait the reality of that age. All province and sea names are written in latin. Only the region names are in portuguese. Each players is dealt an objective, that will only be known by himself. The knowledge of this objective by other players will make your conquest harder. It is important for the player to, when reading the rules, try some practical plays, simulating, inclusively, the mentioned examples. This way it will be much easier to understand the mechanisms of WAR.&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    War&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Little did you know that you weren&rsquo;t the only Senator with such lofty goals, as there are other Senators with a similar agenda.  Players secretly plot to gain the most supporters within the city of Rome to help bring their plan to fruition, and to bring about the fall of Caesar, or at the very least, posture themselves in a position of greater power.&#10;&#10;The game takes place over a series of rounds.  During each round, a new Supporter is revealed and players secretly choose what Tactic they will choose for the round, either to Persuade Supporters of the current type, or to Manipulate the game to their favor.  The game ends immediately if any player manages to have 13 or more Supporters, with at least 1 supporter of each type.  Otherwise, the game ends after the round when the last Supporter card is revealed, and players are awarded points for the Supporters they have left at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Politico: The Fall of Caesar is not an expansion for Politico.  It is a stand alone game that borrows mechanics from the original game.&#10;&#10;",

Who knew that someday a couple of game designers would move the farts from inside the box to the front cover?&#10;&#10;Yes, PRRRT... &ndash; from the designing duo of Ludovic Maublanc and Bruno Cathala &ndash; is all about the rip-roarers and pants-busters that emerge from one's nether regions, more specifically about determining who dealt it (while thankfully avoiding the &quot;who smelt it&quot; end of the equation).&#10;&#10;Each round a situation card is revealed, such as a small crowd in an elevator, and a number of people cards equal to the crowd depicted on the card are turned face up. People cards are valued from 1 to 10 based on the amount of shame that person would have towards you should you be revealed as the culprit. Grannies are merciless...&#10;&#10;Each player receives a hand of five odor cards, ranging in value from 0 to 7, with one 7, two 6s and so on to eight 0s. Going once around the table, each player in turn asks his neighbor, &quot;So how about it? Are you the one contributing to climate change? Are you the one making more methane?&quot; And so on. That neighbor can either fess up &ndash; in which case he scores all the people cards in play &ndash; or he can deny the charge, in which case the active player randomly draws a card from his hand and lays it on the table in front of the neighbor, revealing some of the smell that others have detected.&#10;&#10;If you make it once around the table without anyone confessing, add another person card to the crowd of sniffers, then go around the table again. Repeat this process up to three times, at which point most people will have three cards in front of them. Everyone then simultaneously points to the person who they think created the ruckus (that is, who has the largest total of odor cards), abstaining if they are that person. Everyone then sums their stink, with the &quot;winner&quot; claiming the person cards in play and a card for each person blaming him; anyone who accuses a player incorrectly is penalized. Smallest score after a number of rounds wins the game.&#10;&#10;Being dealt a hand of high numbers doesn't automatically presage your coronation as a gas god as high numbers typically have a special power that comes into play when someone reveals the card from your hand. The 7, for example, removes all other cards in your hand from play, while the 6 lets you exchange up to three cards from your hand with an opponent. With odor comes power!&#10;&#10;",

Most often, the game is lost because all of a player&rsquo;s pieces have been captured and so he has no pieces to move.
