Help me get back to the farm quick before I become someone's side dish!&quot;&#10;&#10;Uh oh! Your little spud pals are in big trouble &mdash; they&rsquo;re in the kitchen and they could be made into &ldquo;food&rdquo;.

But be careful of where you land, or else your spud buddy could get snipped, sliced, pressed into &ldquo;fries&rdquo; or cranked into &ldquo;chips&rdquo;. Help your pal get out of the kitchen and back to the farm first and you&rsquo;re the winner!

Ticonderoga) during the French and Indian War (1755-58). The game system emphasizes the importance of leaders, and highlights the role of individual command skills, circumstances and luck. Throughout the game, leaders&rsquo; skills are tested as their units maneuver and fight, and every leader has the capacity to be &ldquo;inept,&rdquo; &ldquo;capable&rdquo; or &ldquo;exceptional,&rdquo; varying from engagement to engagement.&#10;&#10;The game includes a lot of randomization; so every game may vary in tempo. One game may involve more soldiers than another, and often the quality of the lower-level (unnamed) leaders will be different. There are three campaign and three raid scenarios, featuring many units for the longer games and fewer for shorter ones (280 counters total). Each hex on the Strategic Map represents 1.5 miles, whereas each hex on the Tactical Map (for the area near Ticonderoga) represents just 400 yards. Individual units represent from 50 to 800 men, and leader chits each represent a single commander, sometimes a famous historical figure, at other times an unknown man of low-rank.&#10;&#10;Designed by William Nester and Eric R. Harvey&#10;Map design: Joe Youst&#10;Counters: Trevor Holman&#10;&#10;",

Players can draw as many cards as they wish during their turn, one at a time, until either:&#10;&#10;They want to stop, they draw a DANGER NOODLE! Card, or they draw a negative value card.&#10;&#10;If a player draws a DANGER NOODLE! Card, he/she must discard all of the Cards in his/her hand.&#10;&#10;If a player picks up a Special Card, he/she must read the card aloud and perform the action associated with it.&#10;&#10;Once a player has finished drawing cards from the deck, his/her turn is over and play continues clockwise with the next player drawing from the deck.&#10;&#10;Play continues in this fashion until the sum of one player&rsquo;s hand reaches exactly 30 points.&#10;&#10;WINNING THE GAME:&#10;The game ends when the sum of a player&rsquo;s hand reaches 30 points.

The aim is to win believers from each other and proof once and for all who really rules Christmas.. well until the next game that is.&#10;&#10;The game starts with dividing into two teams and choosing who will be on Team Santa and who will be on Team Jesus. At this point team members will decide which character will represent them in the game. They can choose from the following characters:&#10;&#10;Team Santa: Santa, Mrs. Claus, Rudolph, Prancer, Vixen or one of the elves: Sugarplum, Eggnog or Candy Cane.&#10;&#10;Team Jesus: Jesus, Mary, Joseph, Angel Gabriel, Donkey or one of the three Wisemen: Myrr, Frank or Gold.&#10;&#10;Once everyone has chosen their character they have to refer to each other by these names, if they don&rsquo;t and are called out by the opposing team they will lose a believer card.  Each team starts with 8 Believer cards. If less than 16 players are taking part all the remaining character cards will need to stay near as they will be used for certain challenges.&#10;&#10;From this point on the game explains it self. The teams compete in challenges to prove to their believers that they are more worthy of their adulation than the other team. If they loose a challenge their believers will lose faith and they cross over to the opposing team. There are TEAM and VERSUS challenges. The challenges involve puzzles, riddles, knowledge-based quizzes, orientation games and many more.  You never know how you&rsquo;ll be challenged next.&#10;&#10;",

But it's not quite that simple as not all of the components have the right form &ndash; and players can try to use their construction workers on the lower floors to block out others.&#10;&#10;Players have 5 workers, and are dealt a hand of building tiles. The tiles, in combination with rivets which fit through holes in the center, create a 3-dimensional construction. The tiles have grids in various configurations, and some have a construction worker. On your turn, take 3 actions. Options include placing a worker, moving a worker up a level, or building = adding a tile to the construction (which must touch the tile on which one of that player's workers is standing); score points = 1 per girder touching a girder already built, +1 if worker on tile, doubled if the new tile is now the highest built. There are penalties if you drop tiles or worker tokens, but otherwise you generally alternate taking turns adding tiles to the building.&#10;&#10;The rivets are placed in an hole in the center of the tile and can be fitted to other tiles already in play. There are some (few) construction rules and the building will grow turn after turn. Where add tiles is an important decision but you also need a certain amount of precision and dexterity doing that because if you cause the fall of a worker (yours of opponent) you will loose points. Actually an important part of the game is placing your workers in a way that make much more difficult to opponents to add tiles.&#10;&#10;The game ends prematurely if someone collapses the building; they lose, and whoever is furthest on the score track (after deducting points for tiles remaining in hand) wins the game. Otherwise, most points (after all tiles built) wins!&#10;&#10;",

A player will also get shocked if they push the button too soon--while the light is red.&#10;&#10;The game uses three AAA batteries, so the shock isn't dangerous, but it certainly adds an element of tension to an otherwise rather simple test of reaction speed.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Lightning Reaction Extreme&#10;    Lightning Reaction Revenge&#10;    Lightning Reaction: ReLoaded&#10;    Pocket Shock-It (AKA Pocket Lightning Reaction)&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "The Game of Chips is a simple dice game from the makers of the Sequence.  Components include a cloth bag for storage, poker chips numbered 1-10, a pair of dice, an instruction card, and one pad of preprinted score sheets.  Play consists of three rounds of dice rolling and in which the ten numbered chips are placed in front of a player.  The player then rolls the dice and removes any chip or combination if chips from play that equal the total on the dice.  Repeat until no further chips can be removed.  That player scores the total of the number of chips that have not been removed.  Lowest score wins.&#10;&#10;This game is very similar to Shut the Box, with the following differences:&#10;- Any number of chips totaling the sum of the dice may be removed, not just one or two&#10;- The game is played to three rounds rather than to 45 points.&#10;&#10;",

Possible actions per round are determined by throwing 3 dice per player, then placing a chit of this player in the corresponding box. Once every player has rolled and placed his chits the actions are taken, starting with the 1 box up to the 6 box. For every chit in the box one appropriate action is taken by that player.&#10;&#10;1, 3 and 5 is a barbarian attack, 2 and 4 allows a player to attack, 6 is taxation.&#10;Attacks are resolved by throwing 3 dice, any double causes one hit and eliminates the defending piece, a triple allows for a barbarian breakthrough and eliminates another piece adjacent to the original defender. Taxation allows for a maximum of three coins taken from the board.&#10;&#10;",

You control a group of survivors, not just one ninja of the apocalypse. You control your team to try and take back as much of the city before the infection ends. &#10;Then you can reign as king over the post-apocalyptic city. So how do you do this?&#10;&#10;Each turn, each survivor has one action which can be spent on either &#10;&#10;    Moving &ndash; moving one hex &#10;    Reclaiming the building &ndash; Boarding up the windows so it is safe again and you can lay down your flag to claim your victory points &#10;    Searching rooms &ndash; Each building has a set number of rooms you can search. What will you find, supplies? Survivors? Or the dreaded 10 zombie card!&#10;    And if on a park (farm) tile, then you can farm &ndash; One survivor can choose to spend an action point to farm.&#10;&#10;&#10;Farming? I hear you ask, well in the game once you have reclaimed a park, it is used to produce food. You can spend food at the start of your turn to give 3 survivor 2 action points that turn making them &ldquo;well fed and ready for zombie carnage&rdquo; However you can actively farm a park tile, spending a survivors action point. &#10;This means that at the start of your next turn that farm produces 2 food instead of 1.&#10;&#10;Ending the game!&#10;&#10;The game can end in 4 ways: &#10;The research centre is reclaimed (the cure has been found and the outbreak is over) &#10;The military base is reclaimed (More guns than any one army could need, you are left with a city flooded with zombie soup) &#10;When a group of survivors has reclaimed and spends one turn actively farming 5 farms (who needs to worry about zombies when you have fresh veg and steak every day) &#10;Or finally if one player reaches 50 Victory points before any of the other conditions are met&#10;&#10;However it is the player with the most Victory points that reigns king. So be careful before you cure the infection.&#10;&#10;Victory Points&#10;&#10;So what is worth victory points: &#10;&#10;    Buildings - worth the number of victory points indicated by the yellow number in the top right corner. &#10;    Survivors &ndash; worth 1 victory point each &#10;    When the game ends every 2 supplies card is worth 1 Victory point&#10;&#10;&#10;What else can you use supplies for? &#10;Throughout the game you can trade in 2 of your supplies to give one survivor: &#10;&#10;    Armour &ndash; decrease an attackers dice roll by one &#10;    Weapon &ndash; Increase one of your attacking die rolls by one&#10;&#10;&#10;Or you can build a wall. A wall will stop zombies and must be destroyed by attacking survivors before they can pass.&#10;&#10;Combat&#10;&#10;Combat in Surviving is simple. Survivors attack first. You roll a die for each survivor. Each die roll of 4,5 or 6 kills a zombie. Then any zombies left roll a die each to attack the survivors. A zombie must roll a 5 or 6 to kill a survivor. &#10;Repeat until all zombies are dead or all survivors are dead or have run away.&#10;&#10;That is it. Simple rules so if someone hasn&rsquo;t played before they can jump in and within one or two goes they are as clued in as everyone.&#10;&#10;",

The challenge is carried out with cards; the player with the higher number wins and gets to place his pawn on top of the opponent&rsquo;s pawn. This is more difficult than it sounds, since you only have a limited number of cards and you have to consider carefully which cards to use. In the course of the game the pawns will form high stacks, which belong to the player whose pawn is on top. The winner is the player who has collected the most pawns!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;Yundao is a reworking of Knizia&#039;s Fish Eat Fish. It's a similar case to Goldrausch/Wapi: the game has a new theme, new components, and newly developed ideas, so it's more than just a new edition. This time the underwater theme has been changed to Oriental palaces moving around and growing in height.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "The Wheel of Time CCG is based on the novels of the same name, penned by Robert Jordan, and later, Brandon Sanderson. One player takes the side of the light and the Dragon Reborn, while another takes the side of the shadow and the Forsaken, in a struggle for control of the Pattern, the ultimate fabric and destiny of the universe.&#10;&#10;Each player requires his or her own Hero or Villain deck to play. Each deck features a major character from the Wheel of Time book series. The light side player chooses a hero to play with while the shadow player uses a villain deck. Characters in the side of light include series protagonists Rand al'Thor, Matrim Cauthon, Perrin Aybara, and the other characters of good found within the books. Characters for the shadow include dark friends, as well as Rahvin and the other chosen.&#10;&#10;The players attempt to sway the Pattern to their side and amass the might needed to defeat his or her opponent in the final Pattern challenge and win the game. Along the way players will engage in politics, marshaling of armies, magic, and intrigue in an effort to bring characters, troops, and entire kingdoms onto their side.&#10;&#10;The core of the Wheel of Time CCG involves rolling dice. Characters and troops, each have different stats corresponding to their skill in politics, intrigue, combat and the one power. These stats translate into dice rolls, used to win challenges and to generate resources.&#10;&#10;Every turn, players commit their characters and troops into challenges. Challenges are done via playing challenge cards or initiating the pattern challenge, which is the ultimate objective for both the light and shadow. Unassigned characters and troops can be used to generate resources which in turn, can summon more allies or to attach buffs called advantages.&#10;&#10;Players then contest challenges by comparing dice rolls of their committed characters and troops. The attacking player attempts to roll swords in the in-game custom dice, while the defending player attempts to roll shields. Winning challenge cards grant advantages based on card text, while winning the Pattern challenge may place Pattern tokens toward the side of the victorious player.&#10;&#10;End game triggers upon both players having a total of twenty Pattern tokens, together with any neutral tokens generated during play. The game then proceeds to the final challenge, where the players fight for dominance, again rolling the dice generated by their characters and troops, but this time, adding their Pattern tokens toward their success rolls.&#10;&#10;",

Therefore, to win a game of Habitat, a player must create a complete collection of cards ranked 1-8.  Cards are stacked in order of rank, from lowest to highest, to form Food Chains.  There may be multiple Food Chains and duplicate ranks, but only one card from each rank is needed to win.  By contrast, an unsupported chain of cards carries the risk that creatures become hungry, or even begin to starve!  When a player has collected the necessary cards and all animals are fed, that player declares a &quot;Habitat&quot; and wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

Each player has a deck of 24 cards, and in each of the six rounds, he draws a hand of four cards from this deck. Each player starts the game in Age 1 and adds the progress card of this age to his deck.&#10;&#10;Each round consists of a card phase, lasting 4-5 tricks among all the players, followed by an individual management phase. During the card phase, players try to (1) gather resources (which are on the cards) to pay for the needs of their civilization and to construct buildings, (2) avoid diasters, and (3) collect discoveries. However, the value of a player's cards are affected by which Age he occupies. In Ages 1 and 2, for example, his cards have no color, so they automatically lose to cards of players in Age 3 and above as those folks have discovered the awesome power of hue. What's more, in the primitive Age 1, you can't see the cards before you play them. That's how primitive you are! In Ages 5 and 6, a player can start using trump to beat out those in lower ages.&#10;&#10;The advantages in the card phase are balanced by the needs of your population, which is much greater in later ages. In each trick, each player collects one played card based on the value of their card played, and players then use the resources on these cards (food, tools and science) to satisfy the needs of their population, erect buildings (which supply additional resources), gain advantages (which can protect you from disasters or earn you victory points), or advance to the next Age of S-Evolution. Players score points each round depending on how well they meet the needs of their population, suffering penalties if they fail to do so.&#10;&#10;At the end of the sixth round, players score points for their sets of discoveries, and the player with the highest score wins!&#10;&#10;",

Too bad the zombie horde looking to make you lunch doesn't see it the same way...&#10;&#10;Zombies!!! The Card Game simulates the coming zombie apocalypse in card game form. Each player uses her own deck to form the narrative of her attempted escape; the ground-breaking card design allows for each card to be used for the card effect printed on the front or as a location as indicated by the card's back. The first player to make her way to the &quot;helipad&quot; at the bottom of her deck escapes certain death and wins the game.&#10;&#10;The zombies are right behind you.

The object of the game is to be the first player to fill in all of the spaces on your board.&#10;&#10;On your turn, roll all 6 dice.  You are allowed one reroll if you don't like the results.  Then, arrange the dice in a chain by matching either color or number.  The first die in your chain must match the number of the last number written on your board.&#10;&#10;For example, the last number on your board is a 5.  Your chain could start with a red 5, then continue with a blue 5, a blue 3, and end with a blue 2.  When you have finished creating your chain, write those numbers in the spaces on your player board.  Finally, call out the color and number of the last die in your chain.  Any player who is able to match that number to the last number written on their board may write it down.  The player whose board matches the color of the number you called out can always write the number, even if it doesn't match.&#10;&#10;Use wilds, draw 1s and minus 1s to help yourself and hinder your opponents.  The first player to fill in all the empty spaces on their board wins!&#10;&#10;",

Each question has been given to a group of 100 people who are asked to give as many correct answers as they can within 100 seconds. Questions are list based and will have numerous possible answers. Any correct answer given that none of the 100 people remembered would, therefore, be worth zero points - these are Pointless answers and are the holy grail for players in Pointless. Who will carry off the Pointless 'Trophy' amongst your family and friends.&#10;&#10;For example, if the question asks you to name a film starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Titanic is not a good answer as 88 people in the survey gave this.

You were expecting to learn how to stock shelves and operate the till, but Bette bought a boatload of bettas. In order to boost sales, Bette&rsquo;s come up with a way to make a game out of it, and she&rsquo;s going to award points based on how well you follow her instructions.&#10;&#10;You need to arrange the bettas in 3x3 displays. Customers are most drawn to 6 particular patterns. Use your arrangement ideas (your tiles) to make these patterns pop!&#10;&#10;Plus, customers love seeing a lot of one color in a display. The more you fill a display with your color, the better your bettas are going to sell.&#10;&#10;Once the displays have been filled, or everyone runs short of arrangement ideas, the task is done and whoever has the most points wins!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

This is done by playing Excuse cards to avoid the Project cards and passing the Project to the next player. Other players may also play Recognition cards on you, which make it more difficult to get out of the project with an Excuse. Ultimately, some player will end up completing the Project, and that player adds the card to their completed projects, pushing them closer to the 30 points necessary to be identified as Management Material and losing the game. The last player that avoids being promoted to management wins the game. Event cards provide an additional randomizing element.&#10;&#10;",

These days not storks but steel cranes are characteristic features of Polish landscape. Building and structures are being erected everywhere. New ribbons of asphalt cut through the fields. Sleek spans of slender bridges join river banks. Ring roads encircle towns and cities. Multi-level junctions resemble gigantic works of abstract art. Polish engineers use state-of-the-art technology and heavy construction equipment. Local communities wholeheartedly support the development of transport infrastructure. An architect, a landscaper, a construction mech operator have become dream professions for a child and ideal occupations of a prospective son-in-law.&#10;Welcome to Poland!

Players become managers, their goal is to finish all the contracted jobs faster than the opponents. Engineers, workers and dozens of very special machines are ready to start.&#10;&#10;During their turn players decide either they work in the office or on the building site.&#10;In the office players draw cards from the market and use special cards such as: Recruiter, Archaeologist, Supplier or Site Manager. Those cards make the game easier for the player, but harder for the opponents.&#10;On the building site players bulid infrastructure by discarding relevant cards and placing tokens on the map. They can also get rid of Arachaelogist or use special cards: Local Community or Employee of the Month. &#10;After finishing one of assigned contracts player gets 3 extra cards from the market.&#10;Whoever complete all of his/her contracts first is the winner of the game.&#10;The players have different number of contracts and infrastructures to be build, but the game is very well balanced.&#10;&#10;The biggest advantages of the game are illustrations and high quality of materials used for its production. The board consists of 16 elements, shaped with great likeness to the polish voivodships. The network of roads and highway reflects ambitious plans of national infrastructure. Last but not least, few dozens of tokens and over 150 beautifully painted cards makes this game a &ldquo;must have&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;",
