    "description": "This harness racing game is one of a number of Alga games that deals with horses and horse racing. See also J&#195;&#164;gersro and M&#195;&#165;nvalla med V5.&#10;&#10;A full game consists of six starts divided into three phases (2 starts each). Before each phase, horses are auctioned off to the players; each player gets 2, 4 or 6 horses depending on the number of players. After each phase, players can keep only one horse from the preceding phases, the rest are auctioned off again. Auction is followed by training which is played on a short &quot;training track&quot; on the game board; here the horses can get better - each horse has a value from -5 to +5 which will help/hinder in the roll-and-move race - and the players may also get cards for later use during the actual race.&#10;&#10;Results of the training define starting positions for the race and also give some clue as to each horse's capabilities, so now it's time for betting. A player can bet on up to 2-3 horses, depending on the number of players; betting is secret, and a player can freely bet on any horses, including their opponents'.&#10;&#10;The actual race is conducted as roll-and-move using 2 dice. A special die is used for moving the horses, adding or subtracting their individual modifiers, and a regular d6 is used to determine if a player must pick a race card (on 1 or 6). These affect the race directly and often quite drastically; some may be saved for later use.&#10;&#10;After the race the winning horse gets it's modifier increased by one step, all bets are revealed, money paid out from the bank and preparations made for the next race. Horses that competed in a race may not compete in the immediate next one - this is why the players have several. After the 2nd and 4th races, the auction phase is repeated.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, a bonus is paid to players who managed to bet on the winning horse in 5 or 6 races, any bank loans are paid back, and winner is the player with most money.&#10;&#10;Approximate play sequence:&#10;&#10;1) Auction - buy a number of horses&#10;2) Train them for the race&#10;3) Select horses for race 1&#10;4) Betting phase&#10;5) Run short race&#10;6) Pay winner, both race and betting money.&#10;7) Repeat 3-6, but with long race&#10;8) repeat 1-6 twice&#10;9) Pay bonus to anyone who has picked the winner in at least 5 of the 6 races.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "This game features a flat, 2-D board with a plastic, 3D inner ring and catwalk that are raised off of the regular board.  The rebels and R2 units look like the Rebel Commandos from the Endor assault and R2-D2 from Return of the Jedi.  The stormtrooper is a larger plastic mini, and used during the game when you roll a 1 (a stormtrooper helmet on the die).  The game is played in real-time, and the typical game lasts about 45-60 minutes.  The video tape is 60 minutes long.  Darth Vader does speak to you from time to time on the video tape (yes, you'll have to have a VCR for this game), and it's fairly cool to watch the video just by itself.  The video also has some elements of gameplay in them, as well as original music, video clips and the ending sequence of the destruction of the planet (in case you fail) is of the original Death Star blowing up Alderaan (from Ep4).&#10;&#10;When setting up, you choose a color for your rebel and R2 unit.  Then, you put your R2 unit in the droid control center and the rebel in the hanger bay.  Then place the stormtrooper in the Stormtrooper control center.  You then take 6 explosives and place them near you.  You also shuffle and deal out the Rebel Mission Card.  This tells you the rooms you need to plant explosives in and the key cards you need to obtain to enter the inner level.  You then start the VHS tape.  Darth Vader (played by David Prowse and voiced by James Earl Jones) will come on and goad you.  You then begin play.  As stated above, play is in real-time, so you have to play quickly.  The objective is to plant your explosives and disable the Death Star II (turn off the VHS tape) before it reaches D'rinba IV.  The video is 60 minutes long, with movie scenes from the original trilogy and good music.  If you get caught by the stormtrooper, you get put into the detention block, and either have to have a card that gets you out or wait for the video to play &quot;detention block escape.&quot;  After 30 minutes or so, the player with the most amount of dark side points becomes Vader's &quot;pupil.&quot;  The Pupil is just like the stormtrooper, only you get to search rooms, attack your fellow rebels and foil their plans.  If there is a tie, then the youngest player gets to be the pupil.  It's a fast-paced fun board game that is sorely lacking these days.  This should be re-released with the movie on DVD.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "The aim of this game is to let locals and foreign visitors as they play to become more familiar with Taiwanese food. Using this game book, they can understand the background regarding preparing these special dishes. For foreigners, the enclosed ORDER cards have roman transcriptions (mandarin pinyin or Taiwanese language pinyin for some specific snacks), allowing foreigners to know how to pronounce each dish. So next time they go to a night market they can interact more easily by ordering food directly in Chinese or Taiwanese.&#10;&mdash;description from the designer (translated)&#10;&#10;&#229;&#164;&#156;&#229;&#184;&#130;, &#230;&#151;&#169;&#229;&#183;&#178;&#232;&#158;&#141;&#229;&#133;&#165;&#228;&#186;&#134;&#229;&#143;&#176;&#231;&#129;&#163;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#230;&#151;&#165;&#229;&#184;&#184;&#231;&#148;&#159;&#230;&#180;&#187;&#228;&#184;&#173;, &#228;&#184;&#141;&#229;&#131;&#133;&#230;&#152;&#175;&#232;&#170;&#141;&#232;&#173;&#152;&#229;&#156;&#168;&#229;&#156;&#176;&#230;&#150;&#135;&#229;&#140;&#150;&#230;&#156;&#128;&#228;&#189;&#179;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#232;&#181;&#183;&#233;&#187;&#158;, &#228;&#185;&#159;&#230;&#152;&#175;&#229;&#164;&#150;&#229;&#156;&#139;&#233;&#129;&#138;&#229;&#174;&#162;&#230;&#151;&#133;&#231;&#168;&#139;&#228;&#184;&#173;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#229;&#191;&#133;&#229;&#142;&#187;&#233;&#135;&#141;&#233;&#187;&#158;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#229;&#143;&#176;&#231;&#129;&#163;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#229;&#164;&#156;&#229;&#184;&#130;&#231;&#190;&#142;&#233;&#163;&#159;&#232;&#136;&#137;&#228;&#184;&#150;&#232;&#129;&#158;&#229;&#144;&#141;, &#230;&#136;&#145;&#229;&#128;&#145;&#229;&#176;&#135;&#229;&#133;&#182;&#229;&#140;&#133;&#232;&#163;&#157;&#230;&#136;&#144;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#229;&#128;&#139;&#230;&#156;&#137;&#232;&#182;&#163;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#233;&#171;&#152;&#228;&#186;&#146;&#229;&#139;&#149;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#230;&#161;&#140;&#233;&#129;&#138;&#233;&#129;&#138;&#230;&#136;&#178;,&#227;&#128;&#138;&#229;&#164;&#156;&#229;&#184;&#130;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#232;&#148;&#152;&#227;&#128;&#139;&#229;&#155;&#160;&#232;&#128;&#140;&#232;&#170;&#149;&#231;&#148;&#159;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#229;&#156;&#168;&#233;&#129;&#138;&#230;&#136;&#178;&#232;&#163;&#161;, &#230;&#175;&#143;&#229;&#128;&#139;&#231;&#142;&#169;&#229;&#174;&#182;&#233;&#131;&#189;&#230;&#152;&#175;&#229;&#164;&#156;&#229;&#184;&#130;&#230;&#148;&#164;&#232;&#178;&#169;, &#233;&#153;&#164;&#228;&#186;&#134;&#230;&#156;&#141;&#229;&#139;&#153;&#229;&#174;&#162;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#230;&#142;&#153;&#233;&#140;&#162;&#229;&#164;&#150;, &#229;&#186;&#151;&#229;&#174;&#182;&#228;&#185;&#139;&#233;&#150;&#147;&#228;&#185;&#159;&#230;&#152;&#175;&#231;&#171;&#182;&#231;&#136;&#173;&#230;&#191;&#128;&#231;&#131;&#136;&#231;&#154;&#132;, &#232;&#170;&#141;&#232;&#173;&#152;&#229;&#176;&#143;&#229;&#144;&#131;&#231;&#190;&#142;&#233;&#163;&#159;&#231;&#158;&#173;&#232;&#167;&#163;&#233;&#163;&#159;&#230;&#157;&#144;&#228;&#185;&#139;&#233;&#164;&#152;, &#228;&#185;&#159;&#232;&#131;&#189;&#233;&#171;&#148;&#230;&#156;&#131;&#229;&#129;&#154;&#231;&#148;&#159;&#230;&#132;&#143;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#232;&#190;&#155;&#232;&#139;&#166; (&#231;&#172;&#145;)&#227;&#128;&#130;&#233;&#164;&#144;&#233;&#187;&#158;&#231;&#137;&#140;&#228;&#184;&#138;&#228;&#186;&#166;&#230;&#168;&#153;&#232;&#168;&#187;&#228;&#186;&#134;&#229;&#184;&#184;&#231;&#148;&#168;&#229;&#148;&#184;&#230;&#179;&#149;, &#229;&#164;&#150;&#229;&#156;&#139;&#230;&#156;&#139;&#229;&#143;&#139;&#229;&#173;&#184;&#231;&#191;&#146;&#231;&#153;&#188;&#233;&#159;&#179;&#229;&#190;&#140;, &#229;&#176;&#177;&#229;&#143;&#175;&#228;&#187;&#165;&#231;&#155;&#180;&#230;&#142;&#165;&#228;&#184;&#138;&#232;&#161;&#151;&#230;&#137;&#190;&#229;&#144;&#131;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#229;&#155;&#137;!&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;Players represent competing vendors at the night market.

    "description": "No Regerts: The Game of Art and Poor Life Choices is a light hearted, fast paced, pvp style card game that plays 2-6 players. Your objective is to be the most badass by the end of the game while making your friends look lame.&#10;&#10;Now how? With the playing deck, each player has a &quot;formation card&quot; to show you how your &quot;body&quot; is formed. Your body is made up of six tattooable limbs (two arms, two legs, a chest, and a back); and each limb holds enough space for 3 designs each (so 18 designs in total).&#10;&#10;To fill these limbs, you have to get tattooed. The game consists of three types of cards: Positive Tattoos (indicated by their blue title color and positive value), Negative Tattoos (indicated by their red title color and negative value, and Modifier Cards (which have no number value and have only a gold bar at the bottom of the card).&#10;&#10;Now game play is easy to learn. Each players starts with a hand size of 5 cards... which will remain for the game unless you have a card that says other wise. And you have four main actions on your turn.&#10;&#10;1. Get tattooed:&#10;This can be a positive or a negative tattoo. To get a positive tattoo, you have to discard either another positive tattoo or a modifier (which is good as gold even though it doesn't have a number value) since good tattoo artists don't work for free. To get a negative tattoo, you probably know someone working out of a van or basement that will give you tetanus along with a free tattoo, so negative tattoos are free and don't require a discard payment. Some cards, both positive and negative, have extra effects that are in their description bars under their titles.&#10;&#10;&#10;    Note if you can't or choose not to do either, you can discard two cards to pass. But to get to your second action, you have to get a tattoo on yourself first.&#10;&#10;&#10;2. Open play:&#10;This is where you can do as much as your hand allows. If you can pay for a second tattoo, you can get one. This is also where the use of modifiers come into play and where the pvp aspect comes in. There is a dreaded modifier known as &quot;Bad Advice&quot;. This modifier is what mainly allows a player to play negative tattoos on other players. And there are other great modifiers that also will effect tattoos that are already in play.&#10;&#10;3. Is a require discard.&#10;This allows for a more balance deck as well as forces more strategy and less hording. There are cards that will effect the discard.&#10;&#10;4. Is basically refresh. Fill your hand back to five (unless you have a card that says other wise).&#10;&#10;The end game is determined when one player has filled their body, that player receives 5 bonus points, and everyone then totals their tattoo values to determine the winner. So just because you finished first, it doesn't mean you've won.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "In Rival Kings, two royal families compete for the country and its people. High-ranking personalities prevent the members of the opposing family from using their subjects for their own purposes and from erecting valuable buildings &mdash; but everything comes at a price. Who will lead his family to fame and honor?&#10;&#10;Text from publisher:&#10;&#10;The position of the leader of the empire is vacant. But who has what it takes to become the new king? In order to increase their power, the contenders for the throne rally the country and its people around themselves.&#10;&#10;Who will make the best use of the influence of important personalities and engage his competitors in conflicts without suffering damage himself? Rival Kings is a stalwart card game from HUCH! &amp; friends.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of each cycle, each player chooses one Character card and places it face down in front of him. Once all players have done so, they turn them over simultaneously. The Character cards determine the order of play, the number of possible actions, and potential conflicts. Low-ranking characters have more actions at their disposal, but they may act only after the higher-ranking characters. In addition, each character may come into conflict with certain other characters. When this happens, the higher-ranking character may take one action from the inferior character and carry it out immediately; this action is then no longer available to the lower ranked during his turn.&#10;&#10;After the Character cards have been played and potential conflicts have been resolved, the action phase begins. Now, depending on the action, a player can take money, get rid of Conflict markers, recruit subjects, or buy a building. Players try to secure good combinations of buildings and subjects for themselves in order to get a high score in the end. Besides this, the subjects recruited during the game provide different advantages that can have a crucial impact on the course of the game. However, only one subject is active per player &ndash; if a new Subject card is added, it covers the player's previously laid-out bonus.&#10;&#10;The game ends as soon as one of the card piles has been depleted. The player who has collected the best combinations and has as few Conflict markers as possible lying in front of him has the best chance of assuming the throne.&#10;&#10;",

Standing high above all creation, the gods ruled this world and were worshipped by the creatures living there. This fact was enjoyed so immensely by the gods that some of them decided to decided to find a new world to create and spread even more of their stories and in doing so get more beings to worship them. On this new world, 7 gods from different ancient cultures send forth their envoys to spread word of their greatness, each aiming to become the most popular god of this new world.&#10;&#10;7 different gods with 7 different powers use their Envoys (player tokens) to gain points by Telling Stories (rolling D4 dice) and gain control over villages on Islands.

By playing a card she moves her Envoy to an Island and with the Dice she can Tell a Story (roll the dice) or perform other god actions. When you use the card to move you cannot use the card for other actions that might be on that card. You must make decisions every turn on what part of the cards you use; move or action.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player reaches a certain amount of victory points or when a certain amount of dice is in the Otherworld (the island in the middle of the game board). This threshold is determined at the start of the game and is affected by the number of players and / or experience. The player with the most victory points after the scoring phase wins.&#10;&#10;The game is for 2 to 6 players.&#10;&#10;",

Players construct their decks based around specific automobiles, and then adding &quot;tune ups&quot; cards. Once assembled, each player takes turns trying to play &quot;maneuver cards&quot; to out pace their opponent. Races are held in three &quot;phases&quot;: first a curve (where more maneuverable cars will prevail), a straight-away (speed rules here), and finally another curve. In addition to the various maneuver cards, you can play &quot;navigators&quot; (addition passengers in your car) which can improve your chances of crossing the finish line first. This game is fast paced, and very closely tied to the theme of automobile racing.&#10;&#10;",

Most ground units in the game represent divisions, brigades or regiments. Aircraft units represent two groups or air regiments (six to eight squadrons). Ship units mostly represent one fleet aircraft carrier, 'divisions' of two light or escort carriers, two battleships, four cruisers, squadrons of six to eight destroyers (plus Japanese light cruiser destroyer leaders), and various numbers of other ship types. On the area map, each inch equals 90 miles. Each turn represents from two weeks to two months, depending on the tempo of action at any given time.&#10;&#10;Special rules cover such things as: random events, reinforcements, withdrawals, refits, fog of war, off-map bases, interceptions, invading Australia, long-range bombers, protected targets, shore bombardment, commandos, airborne units, seaplanes, and the Tokyo Express. The game uses the system originally created for our earlier-published game, Red Dragon Rising.

A variety of NATO forces have gathered to stop the onrushing Soviet and Czech forces.&#10;&#10;The Across the Rhine Scenario begins at a later stage in the conflict, with the assumption that the Warsaw Pact has broken through the &ldquo;forward defense&rdquo; lines of NATO. The Warsaw Pact player tries to move his substantial forces over the Rhine River and into the open country beyond, while retreating NATO units stream onto the map, trying desperately to evade the closing Soviet pincers and to fight a successful delaying action.&#10;&#10;The game is played in a series of double impulse game turns, during which the initiative (first move and attack) may pass from player to player. Movement and attacks are halved in the second impulse. The ground scale is 4 kilometers per hex, with each game turn representing about 24 hours.&#10;&#10;The Game Map:&#10;The Drive on Munich map covers the area from the Austrian border to Munich.

For example, 'Planned Engineering Works' allows a player to specify a line that is 'closed' and so cannot be played until that player's next turn. The short rules include a variant that allows multi-game scoring.&#10;&#10;The cards replicate the iconic design of the London Underground map, and the game is licensed by Transport for London.

Set in the Caribbean and North Atlantic during the late 17th and early 18th centuries, SeaRovers recreates the true stories of the most fiendish filibusters and freebooters to ever roam the Spanish Main.&#10;&#10;Historically accurate with unique and engaging game-play, SeaRovers combines; card-play and hand-management, dice-based combat, attacks and saving rolls, and a pick-up and delivery system that rewards tactics and planning. All brought to life on a hex-based map with actual locations of buccaneer and pirate attacks.&#10;&#10;SeaRovers is also a visual tribute to history&rsquo;s classic illustrators Howard Pyle, Frank E. Schoonover, and N. C. Wyeth, whose work defined the archetypal image we all share of pirates today.&#10;&#10;For 1 to 4 players, ages 14 to adult. Play-time averages 30 minutes per player with the Standard movement system (1-4 players, 30-120 minutes), 45 minutes per player with the Advanced movement system which uses wind and course direction (1-4 players, 45-180 minutes).&nbsp;&#10;&#10;",

Meet our heroes: the super-fast Lightning Pork, the Greedy-Piggy, the Cunning-Piglet, the Cool-Beans Pig, the color-changing Pigameleon, the secretive Mystery-Piggy and the strict Ms. Sauerbraten.&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;&#10;Swintus Junior is a commercial version of Crazy Eights, a public domain card game played with a standard deck of playing cards. Goal of the game &ndash; empty youre hand and catch opposing players with cards left in theirs. Swintus Junior players attempt to play a card by matching its color, number, or word to the topmost card on the discard pile. If unable to play, players draw a card from the draw pile, and if still unable to play, they pass their turn. There are special piggy cards which makes game more interesting, not easy and much funny.&#10;&#10;Game contents&#10;&#10;&#10;    28 Superpig cards of 7 types&#10;    64 Number cards of 4 colors &#10;&#10;&#10;",

Set up the game by dealing out the entire pack of cards equally between the number of players and leaving one card in the middle to start the snap pile.&#10;&#10;Each player must then draw the top 3 cards from their respective&#10;draw piles to create their hand (make sure the other players don&rsquo;t see your hand). Snap down any card from your hand onto the centre piles each time there's a match by colour , symbol or number. Only when you have used all three cards in your hand are you able to draw a new hand. Everyone plays at once in a furiously fast race to get rid of their cards fast.&#10;&#10;To make things even more fun, there are action cards throughout the pack - a freeze card, a new peachy pile card and a clear hand pile. Any card can be played on top of an action card.&#10;When you play the freeze card you are then able to nominate any player who then can not play until 5 cards have been played in the game.&#10;&#10;The new peachy pile card allows you to start another brand new pile in addition the the main snap pile.&#10;If the clear hand card is among the three cards in your hand you are able to discard your entire hand onto the snap pile with the clear hand card on top.&#10;&#10;The first player with no cards left wins by saying 'Peach Snaps!'&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The randomized features of the innovative Activation Marker system allow gamers to combine logistics, command, and use of reserves into one simple mechanic, while still providing a maximum amount of uncertainty, tension and fun. The scale of Battle for North Africa also allows players to recreate the sweeping maneuvers of the desert war with scenarios that can be played in one sitting or that cover the entire two years of fighting.&#10;&#10;And for the first time, players will be able to change history, perhaps bringing Rommel's Afrika Korps divisions in before O'Conner can sweep the Italians from Libya!&#10;&#10;With the Gameplayers emphasis on ease of play, most veteran gamers will find themselves in the thick of things in less than 15 minutes, while newcomers will find Battle for North Africa most accessible. And if you can't find a ready opponent, Battle for North Africa has been designed with solitaire play in mind.&#10;&#10;All your favorite units are here -- from Rommel's 5th and 8th Panzers, to the hulking behemoth tanks of the British Royal Tank Regiments, to the Italian Rapgruppamento Maletti, complete with the Saharanio Camel Regiment (which had no camels).&#10;Battle for North Africa will provide an evening of fast armored action, with enough historical and tactical insight to satisfy even the most demanding of gamers.&#10;&#10;&#10;Innovative Sequence of Play -- the Activation Marker System -- that combines uncertainty and play tension, logistical requirements and command capabilities.&#10;Extensive Random Events that include Enigma and Ultra, sandstorms, desert raids, amphibious operations, and even Italian paradrops, all with no extra rules burden.&#10;Differentiation between combat formations and support assets; a simple and elegant combat table that emphasizes combined arms; armor upgrades; Italian surrender; and variable Allied withdrawal.&#10;Four scenarios, including a full 1940-42 campaign that allows players to alter German and Allied arrivals.&#10;Hidden reserve system, variable overrun, counter-attack, and armor superiority.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 1 month&#10;Hex: 8.5 miles / 13.68 kilometers&#10;Units: Battalion to Division&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;Two 22 x 34&quot; full color mapsheets&#10;Two dual-side printed countersheets (280 1/2&quot; &amp; 176 5/8&quot; counters)&#10;One 20-page Battle for North Africa rulebook&#10;Two dual-side printed Player Aid cards&#10;Three single-side printed Play Aid cards&#10;One 10-sided dice&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: High&#10;Complexity Level: Medium&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 4-15 hours&#10;&#10;",

The difference here is the big and powerful Globbo grows bigger all the time (except when one of the cute little urchins has exploded and taken out a big chunk of Globbo).&#10;&#10;The little angels come in three types, Biters who can attack and will explode if hit by Globbo, Blips who are created by exploding Biters and Yeasts who are also created by exploding Biters.  Yeast and Blips can combine to form more Biters.&#10;&#10;Globbo has his weapons also.  His head has a big attack up to 15 hexes away but only in a straight line.  Blue Zap parts which must be adjacent to the head or another Blue Zap piece can attack up to 3 hexes away and the Red Slaps can attack adjacent spaces.  Red Slaps must be adjacent to Blue Zaps.  Globbo moves like a giant amoeba as all his parts try to stay adjacent to the proper parts to remain alive.&#10;&#10;Originally published in The Space Gamer (Issue 62 - Apr 1983).&#10;&#10;",

You might get to tell a crazy story that includes all the words on a card, describe celebrities, or try to explain the words without using a certain letter.

Party Alias challenges everyone to explain, get active and use their creativity!&#10;&#10;This travel version is different from the first Party Alias. It uses dice instead of a spinner, has fewer cards, and the story telling cards are made a little shorter (only 4 required to get the bonus).&#10;&#10;",

It's a combination of making the right choices with your teammates and some luck with rolling the dice. Players start their turn together by placing their banners strategically in the preparation phase. In the action phase players take actions based on where they placed their banner in the previous phase. In the action phase players take actions, for example: Digging up dinosaurs, researching dinosaurs, placing dinosaurs in their paddock, building entertainment buildings or buying upgrades. They succeed in these actions by rolling the right numbers with the dice. If all that is going according to plans, players will be able to fulfill all the requirements of a mission and win the game. But if something goes wrong and the 'danger meter' reaches 20, all players will lose the game.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

Using only 18 cards, you&rsquo;ll draft and position sections of pier, building your unique structure outwards to sea in an effort to score the most victory points.&#10;&#10;During a player's turn they will draft one of the cards from the centre of the table and add this to their pier. This will make their pier larger but depending on how they place it can score them more or less points. The game ends when there are no cards left to draft and players tally up their in game (scoring the highest of that patron that round) and end gamepoints (a&#10;total of all icons scored) to determine who is the winner.&#10;&#10;Victory points are earned by meeting the needs of pier visitors and workers, as well as satisfying the demands of powerful patrons, who&rsquo;ll lend their support to one pier at the end of every round. You also choose a personal goal that you&rsquo;ll attempt to fulfill throughout the course of the game.&#10;&#10;After a number of rounds the player with the most victory points wins the game, and is crowned greatest pier builder of their generation!&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "The game is played using part of the Go board.&#10;&#10;The objective is to score goals by using the men (the black stones) to move the football (the white stone) onto or over the opponent's goal line. Player A tries to move the football to rows 19 or 20 and player B to rows 1 or 0. At the start of the game the football is placed on the central point.&#10;&#10;Players alternate making moves. A move is either to add a man to any vacant point on the board or to move the ball.&#10;&#10;The football is moved by a series of jumps over adjacent men. Each jump is to the first vacant point in a straight line horizontally, vertically, or diagonally over one or more men. The jumped men are then removed from the board (before any subsequent jump occurs). This process repeats for as long as there remain men available to be jumped and the player desires. Jumping is optional, there is no requirement to jump. Note that in contrast to checkers, multiple men in a row are jumped and removed as a group.&#10;&#10;",

Since you will still only have a jumbled set of dominoes, cards and a board, you should try the Junk Yard of games contained in this bag instead.  We have taken come of the best features of cards games like taking tricks, passing cards you don't like to another player and trumping your opponent's clever play.  We've added the great things about dominoes like standing them up in front of you instead of having to hold a deck of cards, stacking them up, knocking them down, and the solid thunk one makes when you play it on the table with authority.  Add a board (well, actually a bag with a board printed on it) to play these games on and make your tiles look better than most other trash and you have Junk Yard and other Trick-Taking Tile-Laying Board Games.&#10;&#10;",
