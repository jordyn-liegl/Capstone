Some of the questions are Multiple Choice in which you must pick one of four possible answers as the true one; others are Statements in which a bizarre fact is declared and you must decide to believe it or not to believe it.  Bluff cards abound, too.  They challenge you to s-t-r-e-t-c-h the truth and make up your own far-fetched statement to dupe and opponent.  Avoid getting stumped.  A wrong answer will advance your opponent's pawn on the gameboard, moving it closer to the final goal of the finish space.&#10;&#10;If you can out-stump and out-bluff your opponents, you'll take the lead in this very different pursuit game to become a big Ripley's winner... believe it or not!&#10;&#10;",

    "age": 15,
    "description": "Machine of Death: The Game of Creative Assassination is a storytelling game set in a world in which a machine can predict how a person will die with 100% accuracy with only a small blood sample. However, the machine delights in being vague and twisted. A card reading &quot;Old Age&quot; could mean you die in your sleep at age 120, or it could mean you're run over tomorrow by an elderly driver who forgot to take his pills today. Players of the game take the role of assassins, who must use the various tools at their disposal -- from storytelling to a slew of items available from specialty Black Market shops -- to create a situation in which a target is killed in a way in line with their Death Prediction. The Machine of Death Game uses this basic idea, of assassins working in a world where cause of death is known to create various game modes.&#10;&#10;The General Gameplay of most modes works like this:&#10;&#10;     A target is assigned, and given certain details (including Death Prediction, and extra Intel details, such as things they particularly like or dislike &ndash; to help predict their behavior).&#10;     Players &ndash; assassins &ndash; are given Black Market Gift Cards. These are the items they are allowed to use in order to accomplish their goal: killing the target.&#10;     Players use the Gift Cards to devise a plan. Each Black Market card provides an item to be used in an Action. Three actions should chain together in some way that results in the death of the target. &#10;     The plan is greenlit, either by a Chief player, or via consensus, depending on game mode. &#10;     The timer starts and the plan is put into action. This is represented by dice rolling to beat a &quot;difficulty score.&quot; An unlikely plan hinging on a single item may need to roll a 6 for that Action, but a rock-solid intricate plan may need to only roll a 2 for each card. &#10;     The skull face on the die also adds a frantic element (replacing the 1 face, if the skull is rolled it prompts the flipping of a Fate Coin to add additional randomness). &#10;     In case of failure of any die roll, that Action didn't work, and the plan must be revised. While the timer continues running, the assassins draw a new Black Market item, amending their previous plan and rolling for a new Action. They may also call in &quot;Specialists&quot;, who are characters with special skills (earned in previous rounds).&#10;     If any three Actions are successful before the timer runs out, the target is killed. With the remaining time, the players may roll for Aftermath tasks (such as fleeing the scene or destroying the evidence). Completion of these tasks earns Specialist cards to be used in later rounds. This is the only way to replenish the group's overall Budget of playable cards.&#10;     If the timer runs out before three Actions are completed, the target escapes. This is the end of the round.&#10;     In the published rules, this also ends the game. This rule was subsequently revised, allowing players to make another attempt on the same target, or take the loss and move on to additional targets. Hard-core players may end the game at this point.&#10;     The team wins if they can accomplish four successful kills before their total Budget of Black Market cards are exhausted.&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Variants:&#10;&#10;     Chief Mode is where one player takes on the gamemaster role of the Chief, answering questions and deciding on the difficulty of the plan being created by the other players. Groups of 4 or more work best in this mode. In groups of 2-3 players, each player states their opinion, and the hardest value is the one used.&#10;     Psychopath is similar to Cards Against Humanity or Apples to Apples. Each player holds a hand of Death Prediction cards that represent hostages. One psychopath announces a murder weapon (based on a drawn Black Market card), and players each toss in the hostage they believe will be most likely to be killed by that weapon. Designed for 4+ players.&#10;     Speed Round is faster-paced and useful for introducing players to the death prediction concept. One Chief presents the Death Prediction Card of an assassination target, and players rush to play a Black Market or Specialist card that they think can kill the person in the predicted way. The Chief assigns a difficulty value to the fastest player's proposed plan, and the player rolls to see if they can pull it off. If they do, they earn that Death Prediction Card as a point; if they fail, another player may propose a plan. &#10;     Mechanical Chief uses 14 regular playing cards to replace the subjective judgments of the Chief. Each Black Market card is dealt with a playing card, the value of which is kept hidden until the die is about to be rolled. This variant is good for faster play, and directs discussions toward justifying the revealed values within the story, rather than debating the merits of various plans.&#10;     Teams is useful for very large groups. The players split into two rival assassination teams, and alternate attacking targets, with a single Chief moderating. Teams operate under spelling bee elimination rules (one team's failure, followed by the victory of the other, results in the first team's elimination). A target that a team fails to kill must then be attempted by the other team, and a continuous narrative persists throughout the entire game.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Whether you've earned a Ph.D. in the science of &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot; or are discovering the world of Leonard, Sheldon, Howard, Raj, and their neighbor Penny for the first time, you're guaranteed to be laughing and having fun.&#10;&#10;In each round, one player serves as Referee, flips over a Red card, and reads it aloud; if it has a green background and says &quot;Experimental Formula&quot; on it, the Referee indicates that as well. The other players &ndash; who have seven cards in hand &ndash; each submit one or two cards face down that they feel best describes the category or description on the Referee's card. For example, if the Red card says &quot;Often Leads to Disaster&quot;, you could submit a Blue card such as &quot;Killer Robot&quot;. If the Red card were an Experimental Formula, such as &quot;Hilarious Battle&quot;, you submit two Blue cards using your envelope, such as &quot;Horny Engineer&quot; and &quot;Giant Rabbits&quot;.&#10;&#10;If any player has a &quot;Bazinga!&quot; card in hand and wants to play it, he must do so after each player has made a submission, but before the Referee has revealed them! The Referee then reveals cards from the Red Deck until he reveals a card of the same type (either Basic or Experimental Formula) as the original card, thereby creating entirely new criteria by which to evaluate those same submissions.&#10;&#10;Next, the Referee mixes up the submitted Blue cards or envelopes so that no one knows who submitted what. Then, the Referee turns all of the cards face up, reading each card name aloud. He then ranks each card (or pair of cards) in the order he feels best matches the criteria on the Red card. The first place submission is awarded the highest numbered point chip, which is taken from the pile, the second place submission is awarded the second highest point chip, and so forth. The player to the left of the Referee becomes the new Referee, and you start a new round. Whoever ends up with the most points wins!&#10;&#10;",

The Ancients, hyper-intelligent beings of unknown origins, manipulate the schemes of both human and machine to achieve their mysterious machinations.

Each player controls the flow and pace of army building through a one-of-a-kind gameplay system formulated to deliver a full strategy experience.&#10;&#10;Players win the game by reducing their opponents' Stronghold Population to zero.

The four sturdy boards have indented playing spaces; the game can be played with a coloured dice as well as an ordinary one, and there are four different ways of playing.&#10;&#10;In each variation of the game, players try to cover all the spaces on their board with wooden counters of the correct colour. By doing this, younger children will learn to recognize and name six colours.&#10;&#10;In one game, counters are kept in the bag and on ordinary dice is thrown to win them. In another game, counters are put in the box lid and players shake both dice.&#10;&#10;Whichever game they play, young children will have endless hours of fun.&#10;&#10;",

Certain ladder rungs have chutes that lead down to lower rungs of either ladder. The lower section of the board has spaces to lay out the game's cards. These cards are either placed picture or number side up depending on which game your playing. The video tape is inserted into your VCR, cued to a game, and played.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you watch the screen and listen to the story. A visual clue (either a picture or number) will appear accompanied by an audio signal. You must then quickly find and remove the card that matches the clue. If the picture beneath the card is a ladder, you move your piece 1 rung up the ladder. If a chute is revealed, and the rung of the ladder your piece is on is connected to the top of a chute, you must move down the chute to a lower rung. If your piece is on the top ladder rung when the story ends you win the game. You also win immediately if you move your piece &quot;over&quot; the top rung of the ladder.&#10;&#10;",

As far as the artwork for the box, the Milton Bradley people had their staff do that.  At one point, the amount of sales was over a million and it approached two million.&#10; Thank you for your interest about the game.  It became a very popular showcase, as I played it with many people on television, including Johnny Carson, Mike Douglas, and Merv Griffin, as the pendulum proved to be a fascinating phenomena.&#10; With all my best thoughts,&#10;Kreskin&#10;&#10;",

[show examples]&#10;&#10;     Card symbols do NOT have a box around them. You can find card symbols on the box, another card, and as the solution to a puzzle. When you see a card symbol, find the matching card in the deck and read it.&#10;     Solution symbols always have a box around them. Solution symbols are associated with an object or location that you need to use as an answer to a puzzle. Solution symbols tell you which solution stick to use to check your answer.&#10;&#10;&#10;This isn't just any escape game - as matter of fact it's the opposite.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The trick, though, is that items of cutlery lie all over the floor, blocking your way to the treats along with the shelving units that stand in the middle of the floor. As in the original Kakerlakak, the cutlery items have a pivot in their center, and players can turn the cutlery during the game to open and close paths.&#10;&#10;On a player's turn, she rolls the cutlery die, then moves the cockroach 2-3 spaces based on the number of pips showing, turning an indicated piece of cutlery before, during or after the move. She then rolls and moves again. Starting after her second move, an opponent rolls the cook die after each movement, and if the cook shows up, that player's turn is over and the dice pass left to the next players. Alternatively, if a player reaches her goal, her turn ends.&#10;&#10;The first player to reach all four of her food goals, then reach the hole in the kitchen floor wins.&#10;&#10;Kakerlakak includes action rules that speed up gameplay. The cockroach and cook players both roll simultaneously, with the cockroach player moving as quickly as possible because as soon as the fifth cook face is rolled, the turn is over. The winning condition remains the same.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Pairs in Pears is a word game consisting of plastic letter tiles inside a cloth bag shaped like a pear. It is from the Bananagrams (letter tiles in a banana) company.&#10;&#10;The Pairs in Pears game involves making pairs of intersecting words that consist of tiles of all the same pattern. One word is up/down and the other is left/right, and they share a vowel or consonant. Whoever makes a certain number of word pairs first, wins. Pairpoints is a variation that includes a more elaborate scoring scheme (1 point for non-pattern-matching words, 2 points for matching words, 5 points for finishing first).&#10;&#10;The large, ivory-like tiles show capital letters in four designs: solid, outline, lines and dots. The different patterns function like different suits of cards. As there are four suits, each containing a complete alphabet, there are a total of 104 tiles. Just as in a deck of cards, each tile is unique (e.g., the G of solids or the H of dots). This adds an interesting new dimension to play with (although the games in the rules only ask that a word consist of same-pattern letters).&#10;&#10;The instructions emphasize the educational value of the tile set: a fun way for children to develop memory and cognitive skills while learning alphabetical order, word construction, vowels, vocabulary, rhyming, and more.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Pirate's Plunder is a card and dice game in which players take on the roles of pirates and engage in a life of swashbuckling adventure on the high seas.&#10;&#10;The game is played in turns.  At the start of the game, each player starts off in a lifeboat.  They have to steal a pirate ship (based on the result of a dice roll), otherwise, they are stuck in the lifeboat and have to skip their turn.  When they have a ship, players draw Playing Cards into their hand.  These cards offer maps for treasures, events to modify a pirate's guns and crews, and other ways to bend the rules of the game.&#10;&#10;A pirate's score is reflected by his treasure, which comes from the wealth-laden ships, loot, and hostages in the form of Treasure Cards.  These cards are drawn from their deck when a pirate plays a map in hand, or by making a successful &quot;Sail Ho!&quot; dice roll during their turn.  Pirates can bury their treasure to keep them safe, although they have to dig it up for it to be counted as score.&#10;&#10;Some Treasure Cards, however, are perils in the forms of deadly pirates (such as Blackbeard) and naval warships.  Players can play perils on fellow pirates, forcing them to engage in combat.  Players can also engage other players in battle as well during a successful &quot;Sail Ho!&quot; dice roll if they choose to do so instead of drawing Treasure Cards.  Such battles are resolved by comparing dice rolls, which are added to the player's number of guns or crew.  The loser's ship is sunk and the player has to start his or her subsequent turns in a lifeboat.  The winner also takes the loser's unburied treasure.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a pirate has 3,000 or more pieces of eight worth of unburied treasure and makes a successful dice roll to &quot;Sail Home&quot;, thus becoming the winner.&#10;&#10;",

One day you hear about a mysterious ritual taking place in the underground cellar of the city&rsquo;s prestigious Miskatonic University. You and your team decide to infiltrate and investigate the ritual anonymously, in the hope of securing the next exclusive. Without much thought you step into the cellar, but it doesn&rsquo;t take long before you come to regret your decisions. The cellar is a shrine to ancient god and the horrifying ritual is tearing apart the minds of those who participate, causing them to go insane!&#10;&#10;In the dark and musty cellar, worshipers are passing around artifacts. The light is dim so you can&rsquo;t quite make out the artifacts you are passing around. However, further away in the distance you get a glimpse of what others are holding. You can see the effect these magical artifacts are having on their bearers. You will need to deduce what you&rsquo;re holding by studying the other worshipers.&#10;&#10;Preserve your sanity and escape from the ritual alive!&#10;&#10;Game Play Overview&#10;&#10;In Arkham Ritual, you don&rsquo;t see the card you are holding. Instead, you see the cards other players are holding. You must guess the card you are holding by looking at other players&rsquo; cards and the cards that have already been played.&#10;&#10;The game is played over multiple rounds where each round consists of multiple turns. During each turn, one player draws the top card of the deck, looks at it, and passes it to another player. The player who receives the card has a choice either to a) discard the card he / she is holding face up and take the new card without looking at it, or b) pass the card to another player without looking at it. After a player takes a turn, another player takes his / her turn.&#10;&#10;The round continues until one of the round end conditions is met, at which point all players reveal their cards. At this time, if you are holding a cursed (red) card, then the card corrupts your mind and you lose your sanity. If you are holding a sane (blue) artifact card but some other players are also holding the same artifact card (regardless of their color), the artifacts create an unpleasant resonance, corrupts your mind, and you will lose your sanity. You successfully survive the ritual only if you are holding a unique sane (blue) card.&#10;&#10;Players lose their sanity by discarding sanity markers. New rounds continue until one or more players have lost all their sanity markers. All players who still have sanity markers survive the ritual. Will you successfully investigate the ritual and come out alive!?&#10;&#10;Components&#10;28 cards&#10;30 sanity tokens&#10;7 player aids&#10;1 play sheet&#10;&#10;",

Players are given tons of little army units to place onto the map of the world.  When it's your turn, you use your units to attack other players' positions, hopefully with superior numbers.

    "description": "The hobby of wargaming was born in the 1950s with the publication of the game Tactics. TACTICS II is a direct descendant of this original board wargame.&#10;&#10;TACTICS II is sort of like military chess. Different pieces, called &quot;units&quot; in wargames, have different capabilities just like chess pieces. The major difference is that a player can move all his pieces each turn, and after all his pieces are moved, battles are resolved against the enemy units his pieces are next to (adjacent to).&#10;&#10;The other major difference between wargames and chess is that wargames have a mapboard, divided into squares or hexagons for movement purposes. TACTICS II has a 22&quot; x 28&quot; mapboard portraying a fictional continent with two countries, Blue and Red. Terrain includes roads, rivers, woods, mountains, beaches, and cities. The Blue Capital can only be reached over a vast plain, bordered on the left by mountains and on the right by woods. The Red Capital is on an island and can only be reached across one of several bridges or by an amphibious invasion.&#10;&#10;Game features include special functions for headquarters units, terrain effects, invasions, airborne assaults, weather effects, replacements, isolation, and even nuclear weapons. Units represent infantry (25 per side), armor (6), mountain (2), airborne (2), headquarters (1+2+4), and amphibious troops (2) and 6 counters without symbol (You can use as replacement for headquarters having fired their nuclear missile; the 3 types of headquarter have different nuclear missiles). 100 counters in all.&#10;&#10;TACTICS II was almost always part of the Avalon Hill game line, primarily because it was sold as an introductory wargame for a number of reasons. The rules introduced many basic board wargaming concepts and were relatively low in complexity. The rulebook is divided into a basic game and a tournament game (advanced game). Both are balanced and relatively quick playing. As the opposing armies are identical in size and composition, victory is gained by a combination of logic, foresight, luck, common sense, and skill in military strategy and tactics.&#10;&#10;In 1981, an unauthorized hex map version, called Opera&#195;&#167;&#195;&#163;o MX-1, was released in Brazil. It is sometimes referred to as &quot;Tactics III&quot;.&#10;&#10;",

The game is packaged very efficiently, in a small clear plastic tube, along with a rules sheet and four small flat tokens. Q-Turn is thus highly portable, and can be played on any flat surface, from the lunch counter to an airline tray table.&#10;&#10;The game is played by randomizing the disks and placing them face down on the table in a 4x4 pattern. Tokens are placed at the corners, with the goal being to move your token to the opposite corner and back again before your opponents. As the tokens move across the board, disks are flipped over, revealing arrows that indicate which way a token may move next. Each type of disk allows a different special action, rotating one or all of the disks a quarter turn, thus changing the available paths across the board.&#10;&#10;A quarter-turn here, and a quarter-turn there, and soon everyone may be headed off in the wrong direction!&#10;&#10;Microbadge&#10;&#10; Buy It&#10;&#10;",

Your turn concludes when you add a stone which forms 2 or less connections with neighboring stones.  The object is to have the most stones on the board after it has been filled with stones.&#10;&#10;Flume gameplay is strongly related to Dots and Boxes gameplay.&#10;&#10;",

Each player starts with 3 planes, chosen from 14 different types available. One side are the 'Intruders'. the other 'Interceptors'. Each turn represents 30 seconds of real time. There are a variety of missions and you may use whichever aircraft you want, so that you can guage the different performance capabilities of each craft. This is an old-fashioned wargame and has been superceded by much more realistic (although also much more complicated) games, but if you like the theme and you want a quick, 'fun' wargame, this is ideal.&#10;&#10;",

The actions are: drawing a stop, drawing a trail, and building a camping lodge. In order to draw a trail, the player must draw either a straight line or a line with a single 90 degree bend in it between two of their own stops.&#10;&#10;The end of the game is triggered by the requisite number of boards being filled with camping lodges. Points are awarded for each area that a player's trails go through, animals that can be seen from their trails, and building camping lodges next to stops. Points are lost for any stops that are not connected at the end of the game. The player with the highest total points across all the boards wins.&#10;&#10;Rift Valley Reserve is a highly tactical, no luck, game that offers much strategic depth whilst using a very simple ruleset meaning the game appeals to gamers and families alike. Try to score the most points while blocking off your opponents; no crossing, branching or using of other players' infrastructure is allowed.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Pro Tennis simulates tennis matches in the early 1980's, the era of Jimmy Connors, John McEnroe, Martina Navritolova and Chris Evert. Included are cards for 50 men and 50 women professionals. Each card has a column for &quot;Serve&quot;, &quot;Serve Return&quot;, &quot;Volley&quot; and &quot;Special&quot;. Play consists of rolling dice (two white dice, plus a red die that isn't added to the others but sometimes changes the outcome) and cross-indexing the number rolled with the proper column. The result will be a point for one of the players or an instruction to roll next in one of the other columns. Once in a while, a player gets to make a choice that varies a column's results, and random events, such as stomach cramps, broken rackets, arguments with the umpire and thunderstorms, are possible.&#10;&#10;To take an example, Connors is pitted against McEnroe. Connors has the serve. He rolls 1, 5 (white) and 3 (red). The dice roll is 15 (read the dice as digits, low roll first); the red is ignored unless it's a 5 or 6. A 15 in Connors' Serve column is &quot;I&quot;, which means that McEnroe can return the serve. He rolls 2, 2 (white) and 1 (red) - a 22, which yields a &quot;V&quot; in his Serve Return column. Connors must now roll against his Volley column. He gets 4, 6 (white) and 5 (red). Ordinarily, a 46 would be a point for him, but the red 5 allows McEnroe to make a clutch return. He rolls the white dice (only). A score equal to or less than his Clutch Value is a V result; anything higher loses the point. McEnroe's Clutch Rating is 33. He rolls a 3 and a 6 - not good enough, and Connors is ahead 15-love.&#10;&#10;Connors serves again: 4, 6 (white) and 5 (red). An ace for Connors; McEnroe doesn't even get a clutch return. 30-love.&#10;&#10;The next Connors serve: 2, 2 (white) and 2 (red). Triples generate a random event. (Many players think that random events are too common and limit their appearance to rolls of triple 1's.) Connors rolls the two white dice: 3, 4. He's gotten into an argument with the umpire (realism!) and draws a warning. If he argues again, he'll automatically lose a point.&#10;&#10;Back to serving: 1, 4 (white) and 2 (red). The result is &quot;I&quot;. McEnroe's return: 3, 4 (white) and 1 (red) - a &quot;V&quot;. Connors rolls 1, 2 (white) and 4 (red). A 12 on his Volley column is &quot;S&quot;, which means that he returned the shot but left his opponent in a good position. McEnroe can roll on the favorable &quot;Special&quot; column. Sure enough. He rolls 3, 5 (white) and 3 (red); a 35 on his Special column wins the point. 30-15.&#10;&#10;And so it goes.&#10;&#10;This not a game for anyone who wants to devise winning strategies. Rather, the players watch as the dice play. That is, however, the point of this kind of sports simulation: to project what would happen if real athletes competed in imaginary matches.&#10;&#10;The game also includes rules for doubles, mixed doubles and matches between men and women.&#10;&#10;",

Players are each dealt 10 face down cards which are arranged in spots from #1-10 to begin.  One player then draws a card from the top of the stock of remaining cards and uses it to replace a face-down card in the appropriately numbered spot if possible.  His turn continues until he draws a card that matches a card number already flipped or draws a Queen or King which cannot be placed in his array.  He discards the unusable card and his opponent can then choose to pick up that card and begin his turn by placing it into the appropriate spot in his array.  Jacks are considered wild and can be replaced by the appropriate number if they are already placed in one's array.  The first person to fill all of his spots with face-up cards wins the round and will play the next round with one less spot (so after round 1, for example, he will only use 9 cards).  The game continues until one person has no spots remaining at the beginning of his turn.&#10;&#10;",
