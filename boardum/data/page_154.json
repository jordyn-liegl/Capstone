No combat distinction between infantry and cavalry or between militia and regulars.  Colonial militia appears at full force in a region whenever a British force enters it but can never leave the region. Tory militia appears once per region the first time British regulars enter, and they can be converted to regulars and leave the region, but will never reappear in that region once they've left.&#10;&#10;The British player wins by controlling regions whose victory point total exceeds the scenario requirement.  Colonials win by winning three major battles, by winning two major battles while limiting the British player to less than half of the scenario victory point total, or by lasting to the end of 1783 without the British player winning.&#10;&#10;Multiple &quot;what-if&quot; situations are provided, with each one adjusting the British victory point level required to win.  Many of these can be used in combination, resulting in moderate replay value.&#10;&#10;",

Any lace can be moved by either player, but it must be moved the exact number of spaces rolled, then threaded through an empty hole. When you're unable to complete your turn, you lose. And so, the goal is to maneuver the laces to limit your opponent's options &mdash; but should they escape, they might just hand your crafty trap back to you.&#10;&#10;This is a simple, strange, and sprightly little game that takes only a minute to learn. There's something soothing about the sound of the shoelace sliding against the board as you pull it through. And there's something gently nerve-wracking as the holes get fewer and fewer and the laces start to get shorter and shorter. Each match results in a unique and visually appealing crisscross of blue and pink laces. Every lace has a knot carefully tied at one end by hand &mdash; by either designer Amabel Holland, publisher Mary Holland, or one of our friends.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

It is a fun card-driven character building game featuring a hilarious uncontrolled narrative that unfolds differently every time.&#10;&#10;As an aspiring super villain, you are trying to make your mark in the world. In Villainy you are trying to be the first villain to complete three plans to beat Fantastiman, that pesky super-hero who watches over the city day and night. You must hire minions to aid you in your quest for world domination. You will have to do crimes and go to work as your alter ego to learn the skills necessary and gain the cards required to see your great plans through to their triumphant end.&#10;&#10;Today is the day that Fantastiman will fall...&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Mechanics Description:&#10;&#10;In Villainy, players gradually build a stronger team of villains. Each turn, players typically perform a single action which may include purchasing a new team member with money, increasing one of four team member's stats, earning money, and completing objectives.&#10;&#10;Each team member has three primary stats: strength, charisma, and intelligence. In addition, they can each acquire 6 abilities such as a scientific knowledge or the possession of a weapon. Team members can also gain an additional special action and extra income by purchasing an alter ego card such as a software engineer.&#10;&#10;Players draw an initial objective card that describes minimum statistics and abilities a team must have to complete that objective. Players then spend turns building their team to meet those requirements. There is a pool of characters a player can purchase with money. There is another pool of crimes and alter ego cards that a player can select and which will provide money or increase a team member's stats. These pools will cycle throughout the game and choosing which cards to select and which characters to purchase are important to building a strong team.&#10;&#10;Once the requirements are met, they may spend a turn to complete the objective. The first two objectives are met simply by having a team with the right requirements. The third in addition to having these requirements includes a mechanic where the team fights against Fantastiman. During this third and last objective, players will draw random challenge cards that may decrease their team stats and abilities. If the team overcomes these challenges and still meets the minimum requirements, they can then complete the fight by rolling a high value with a dice.&#10;&#10;The first player to complete all three objectives is the winner.&#10;&#10;There are additional challenges or fights which occur both randomly and as a player's action throughout the game. Typically these fights award a bonus to one player without hurting another. It is these challenges and several special abilities that steal from other players that make up the majority of player to player direct conflict.&#10;&#10;",

To win, you must build your Burger to completion while keeping other players from building theirs.&#10;&#10;During your turn, you will play an ingredient for your Burger and draw a card; This repeats until you can no longer play.  Once your turn is finished, you can either discard a card or play a Battle Card.&#10;&#10;Battle Cards add and take away ingredients, protect your Burger or blow other players' Burgers up. Some can be as simple as switching hands others can be as devastating as destroying all the Burgers on the table, including yours.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

In wargame parlance, it is &quot;grand-tactical&quot; in scope, in that players command entire armies, moving whole corps and divisions on the table. The basic unit on the table-top is the brigade, representing a few thousand soldiers. At this scale, of course, many things are abstracted. We do not concern ourselves with the actions of small groups of soldiers. Rather, we place ourselves in the roles of generals, ordering thousands of men to move, attack, or defend. And, like those generals of history, we don't know whether or not our officers and men are going to behave exactly as we hope or expect.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "The Battle of Velikiye Luki, sometimes called The Stalingrad of the North, was fought during the Winter Campaign of 1942-1943. It was part of the northern pincer of the Rzhev-Sychevka Strategic Offensive (Operation Mars). The Soviet objective was to liberate the Russian city of Velikiye Luki and to cut the north-south rail line to the west of the city.&#10;&#10;Rather than attacking the town directly, the Soviet forces advanced into the difficult terrain to the north and south of the town. Despite heavy losses, they successfully cut the land links to the city, trapping the garrison. Hitler demanded that all the surrounded formations hold out while relief forces counterattacked to open a route to the encircled units. The garrison held out against repeated and determined Russian assaults. In the meantime, Soviet attempts to take their main objective, the rail lines at Novosokolniki, had been frustrated by the counter-attacks of the relief force. An attempt by the Germans to reach Velikiye Luki in late December ran into stubborn Soviet defense and was halted. The German garrison finally surrendered on January 16th.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "CONTEXT&#10;At the beginning of the 20th century, capitalism and the nation-state are in full swing, workers have it hard: Working conditions; Work time; Wages; Unsanitary housing; everything systematically leans in favor of employers.&#10;&#10;Yet since May 1, 1886 and the Haymarket Massacre, workers have tried to organize and resist, supported by a new generation of increasingly committed anarchist and union activists.&#10;&#10;The scenario of &quot;Which Side are you on?&quot; takes place in New York, during the winter of 1910-1911 and stages homes of workers who try to survive and organize themselves to take control of the means of production before the employers become too powerful. It takes place between two events revealing the working conditions of textile workers:&#10;&#10;- On November 25, 1910, a fire occurred at a four-story factory in Newark, New Jersey. 25 factory workers, mostly young women, died.&#10;- On March 25, 1911, exactly four months after the Newark event, a fire engulfs the 8th, 9th, and 10th floors of the Asch Building, occupied by the Triangle Waist Company, causing the death of 146 workers.&#10;&#10;THE GAME&#10;&quot;Which Side are you on?&quot; is a historical and cooperative survival game that simulates the struggle of the workers in New York between the years 1910 and 1911; for their survival; against employer offensives; for the control of the means of production.&#10;&#10;Workers pose and resource collection mechanisms allow for a fluid game; and a system of elements with their historical context, which facilitates immersion.&#10;&#10;This game will particularly appeal to players who like adversity, cooperation, immersion, History ... and perseverance!&#10;&#10;HOW TO PLAY&#10;1-A game lasts 10 turns. Each turn, the bosses carry out offensives through cards drawn at random. These cards establish temporary or permanent mini-rules against players.&#10;&#10;2-You will be playing a family or a small group of people living together. Each member is one of your &quot;workers&quot; and has one action to perform per turn.&#10;&#10;3-Each turn, you send your &quot;workers&quot; to the Tiles of New York in order to: a / work and be paid in order to pay your rent, your food and the expenses of the struggle; b / work in political places to cause agitation, strikes or sabotage.&#10;&#10;4-Then, you will use agitation, strikes and sabotage to fight the bosses offensives against your rights.&#10;&#10;5-With the added agitation, evolve the New York Tiles to make them more worker friendly; complete 6 objectives and take control of the means of production BEFORE the bosses take control of everything and even leave you enough to survive.&#10;&#10;6-Be careful, each turn you will have to draw: a / misfortune cards which will make everyone's life even more difficult; b / incident cards which will strike the player who will have the most Risk (obtained according to the work), Police Threat (obtained by causing agitation) OR the least healthy.&#10;&#10;7-You could end up with workers in prison, injured, or sick. Which will lower your possibilities for your next turn.&#10;&#10;HOW TO WIN&#10;1-Victory: Take control of New York's means of production by purchasing 6 objectives with your resources.&#10;2-You lose if you fail to pay the cost of your living or if the bosses reach turn 10.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

During the At-Bat Step, managers will play player cards out of their hand in an attempt to hit safely or draw a walk. In response, the defending manager may play a defender out of their hand in an attempt to mitigate the damage or record an out. When players hit or walk, their cards move around the bases. During the Steal Step, the batting team may attempt to use their Runners' speed to take extra bases and the defense may, again, respond with a defender in attempt to throw the runner out.&#10;&#10;Whichever team has the most runs after 3 innings, is the winner!&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "The Desert&#10;Sere, serene, eternal, the Western Desert stretches across North Africa.  &#10;Here, Rommel - perhaps the greatest of Germany's generals - marshalled Italian troops and powerful German panzer forces to sweep the desert in brilliant blitzkrieg.&#10;Here, Wavell, Auchinleck and Montgomery fought bitterly to destroy the enemy and defend Alexandria. &#10;Here, history's great generals developed the mobile tactics of modern warfare.&#10;&#10;&quot;Rommel in North Africa: The War in the Desert 1941-42&quot; is a two-player wargame, designed by Jon Southard and published by West End Games in 1986, depicting the campaigns in North Africa during World War II using a Point-to-Point Movement map and an unusual sequence of play.&#10;&#10;The game's Point-to-Point movement system and unique battle reinforcement rules create a sense of sweeping manuever, while channeling conflict along routes of movement and supply. The long buildup periods, that drag on and on in most Desert War wargames, require only moments to play in Rommel in North Africa, while manuever and combat absorb most of the playing time. Players experience the realities and excitement of the Desert War without the boredom.&#10;&#10;A turn may last a few minutes or much longer, depending on how hard players are willing to push their forces. Like the war itself, periods of relative quiet explode into furious, quick-playing manuever and combat.&#10;&#10;Three scenarios and the Campaign game:&#10;- Rommel's First Offensive: depicts the first dramatic sweep against Eighth Army.&#10;- Operation Crusader: picks up with the first successful British counter offensive.&#10;- Gazala: a revitalized Afrika Korps is faced by an entrenched Eighth Army.&#10;- The War in the Desert: the entire 20-month War, from April '41 to November '42.&#10;&#10;",

Game Theory and Related Approaches to Social Behavior, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York.&#10;&#10;This game was devised in 1950 as a simple social game to model the behavior of people when forming coalitions.  To make progress in the game you must form a coalition with at least one other player, but to actually win requires betraying your coalition.  It is said that 'The four authors still occasionally talk to each other' and the initial tests of the game resulted in married couples going home from parties in separate cabs.&#10;&#10;The objective is to be the last player with a stockpile of chips.  (Each player starts with seven of a unique color.) Each play reduces your stockpile by one chip, and it is replenished through captures or gifts from other players. Players have some measure of control over who plays next, but captures either benefit another player or require that another player chooses to let you make a capture.&#10;&#10;Players may form any non-binding agreements provided that all discussion is done at the table.  Working together allows players to capture chips and force other players out of the game.  In the end, one player must betray their coalitions to win.&#10;&#10;The authors are also responsible for inventing the dollar auction and a great deal of economic theory.&#10;&#10;",

The battle was divided into two distinct phases, and a scenario is provided that covers each phase as a self-contained game.  Also included is a Campaign Game that allows the Players to refight the series of engagements as a single, continuous game.  The first Scenario, &quot;Spearhead&quot;, involves the period from December 18-21, 1944.  It presents the phase of the battle when the spearhead of the German 5th Panzer Army first approached the vital road and communication center at Bastogne.  The second Scenario, &quot;the Relief of Bastogne&quot;, depicts the situation from December 21-26, the period of Patton's drive up from the south to relieve the siege of Bastogne and open a supply line to the defenders.  Each Game-Turn represents one-half day of actual time, and the scale of the map is approximately 850 meters per hex.&quot;  (from the Bastogne rules folder.)&#10;&#10;Bastogne is one of four games included in the Westwall: Four Battles to Germany set.  The game includes a 17&quot; x 22&quot; three-color map, 100 counters and and Exclusive rules folder.

All of the Titans have a power that directly attacks their opponents, either through an attack or through fire tokens. Fire tokens deal damage equal to the mayhem die, just like a regular attack, but deal their damage at the beginning of each round.&#10;&#10;When a character is KOed, they are removed from the board and their opponent gains VPs, with the KOed character returning to play next round.&#10;&#10;When you're not fighting, you use teamwork to complete missions from the special GO! deck for a chance to gain VPs.&#10;&#10;",

A hand of Poker betting takes place, with bets added to the &quot;Poker&quot; pot, and the winner wins the &quot;Poker&quot; pot.

There are 517 playing pieces: 352 combat units and 165 markers.&#10;&#10;Both sides bring swarms of tanks to your game table: Shermans and Fireflies, Cromwell and Churchills match up with Panthers, Panzer IV's, and Tigers.&#10;&#10;",

This feature changes the strategy somewhat, as your final score is a golf score, not a cribbage score. Therefore, 1-point tricks that you would normally take without thinking in regular cribbage must be weighed carefully, as that one point may just put you in a sand trap or water hole on the golf course, costing you a stroke to your game.&#10;&#10;",

Travel to different locations, rescue citizens, defeat minions, and save the day!&#10;&#10;Players: 1 - 100+&#10;Game Time: 20 minutes&#10;Items needed: 4 six-sided dice and your favorite token, meeple, miniature, or pawn to represent your superhero&#10;&#10;Setup: Determine your Superhero power for this game. Roll 2 d6 for your choices for your superpower this game, choose one superpower (Reroll if necessary until there are two different numbers). Different players can choose a different superpower.&#10;&#10;Name your superhero and draw their costume. Place your Superhero token in the middle circle as your starting place (this is the only time your token will be in the middle circle)&#10;&#10;The game is played over 10 rounds simultaneously, with players trying to earn the most points (honor). All players will use the same dice pool for each roll, assigning however each player determines.&#10;&#10;Gameplay: Each Round you will Roll 4 dice and then spend those 4 dice&#10;&#10;- Roll 4 dice - Roll the 4 dice. Write the numbers in the top right corner on the current round&rsquo;s track. This is just used as a helpful reference.&#10;&#10;- Spend dice to either &ldquo;Move&rdquo; or &ldquo;Help&rdquo; - each die can be used to either move your superhero or help people in your current location (by marking an X or a number).&#10;&#10;Move - There are two ways to move. Move your superhero token to the location that matches the die, or use a die that matches your superhero&rsquo;s current location to move your superhero token to any location.&#10;&#10;Help- Use a die to help in your current location, marking an X or writing a number (depending on the location).&#10;&#10;Repeat this until 10 rounds have been completed.&#10;&#10;Using your Superpower: You may use your superpower three times throughout a game. The three blank squares in the middle circle (under your superhero) are there to show how many superpower uses you have remaining. You may use your superpower at any time, even multiple times in a round. For each use, mark an X in the square.&#10;&#10;Superpowers explained:&#10;1 - Shrink - Change any die to a 1&#10;2 - Teleport - Use a die to travel to any location&#10;3 - Ice - Decrease a die by one (Example: Change a 4 to a 3, or a 2 to a 1. 1&rsquo;s cannot be changed)&#10;4 - Fire - Increase a die by one (Example: Change a 3 to a 4, or a 1 to a 2. 6&rsquo;s cannot be changed)&#10;5 - Shapeshift - Change one die to the same number of another die rolled this round (You may not Shapeshift a Wild die)&#10;6 - Grow - Change any die to a 6&#10;&#10;Using Wild Dice: When you unlock a wild die, circle it in the bottom section with all the Wild dice. You may at any time spend a wild die. A wild die is an additional die that is any number. When you use a wild die, mark an X over an unlocked wild die icon to show you have spent it. You can spend multiple wild dice in a round, and you can use wild dice immediately after gaining them. You may use wild dice for moving or helping.&#10;&#10;Rescuing Bystander Meeples: &#10;When a Bystander Meeple rescue requirements are met, you circle a Bystander icon in the bottom section with all the Bystanders. At the end of the game, each rescued Bystander earns you 5 Honor.&#10;&#10;Defeating Robot Minions:&#10;Each location has three Robot Minions that are causing trouble. You may spend any number die to defeat one of these minions, marking an X over it at the location, then marking an X over a Robot Minion in the corresponding section at the bottom. At the end of the game, each defeated Robot Minion earns you 1 Honor. (Robot Minions are a last resort at a location when you do not have any better options, so dice do not go to waste.)&#10;&#10;Each Location Explained:&#10;&#10;1 - City Hall - Mark an X for matching die (1, 2, or 3) in any order. When the 1, 2, and 3 are marked off diagonally, you earn a Wild die. When all locations are marked off (all 9 spaces), you rescue a Bystander. Earn 4 Honor for each row and/or column completed.&#10;&#10;2 - Hospital - Same number pairs. You can use the same number for multiple pairs. You can start a new pair before completing others. You do not have to go in any order.&#10;&#10;3 - Downtown - Same number for the entire run. It can be any number to start, but it must be the same number for the rest of the game. You must start at the bottom, then continue up. Rescue Bystander or gain a Wild Die when the corresponding box is filled in.&#10;&#10;4 - Powerplant - Start on the leftmost square. You can start with any number. The next number must be exactly one higher or lower. It may not be the same number. (Example: You use a 5 die to help, writing a 5 in the leftmost square. The next number can either be a 4 or a 6. You use a 6 die to help, writing a 6 in the next square. The next number will have to be a 5, as there is nothing higher than a 6.)&#10;&#10;5 - Warehouse -Start on the leftmost square. You can start with any number. The next number must be equal to or higher than the previous number. (Example: You use a 2 die to help, writing a 2 in the leftmost square. The next number can be a 2 or higher. You use a 4 die to help, writing a 4 in the next square. The next number can be a 4 or higher.)&#10;&#10;6 - Church - Mark an X for matching die. You can mark off in any order. If you complete a complete column (1-6 or 6-1) you gain 15 Honor. If you complete the top six you earn a Wild Die, if you complete the bottom six you rescue a Bystander.&#10;&#10;End of Game:&#10;After you have completed the 10th roll/round, total your Honor/points earned from each location, rescued bystander meeples (5 honor per), and defeated robot minions (1 honor per). The player with the most Honor is the winner!&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Subbuteo Cricket continued the line of sporting dexterity games started by Subbuteo football (soccer).  The game was played on a green beige mat, similar to that use for the soccer version.  The rules mimicked those of cricket (which will doubtless make this review impenetrable to most nationalities).&#10;&#10;The bowling side placed the small red plastic ball in the channel in the bowling piece, which was then flicked to propel the ball towards the batsman and a small plastic wicket (complete with separate plastic bails).  The batting action was achieved by spinning a handle attached to a small plastic cricket bat, aiming to hit the ball to score runs; the number of runs scored depended on the distance the ball was hit.&#10;&#10;The fielding side set out its players, which were small plastic men each on a molded plastic base which included a cup-shaped depression.  If the ball was hit into one of these depressions, that was a catch.&#10;&#10;The rules allowed for run outs (flick the ball to hit the wickets), leg before wickets (a complex and controversial assessment of whether the ball hit the plastic batsman &quot;in line&quot; with the stumps) and even stumping.&#10;&#10;The game did not have the genuine skill and excitement of the soccer version, but strangely it did just about work as a contest.&#10;&#10;In line with other Subbuteo games, there was a variety of &quot;extras&quot; to buy, including scoreboards and boundary fences.  It was well worth saving your  pocket money in the 1970s to save for the Australian team (baggy green caps), or the West Indians (black players with maroon caps).&#10;&#10;",

Twelve wooden pins numbered 1-12 are placed in a cluster in the starting area. On a turn, a player shoots a wooden disc from the slingshot-style launcher on the open end of the board to attempt to knock down one or more pins. If a player knocks over only a single pin, the player scores points equal to the number on the pin; if the player knocks down two or more pins, the player scores points equal to the number of pins knocked down. After scoring, the player stands the pins up where they fell. Alternatively, if the player knocked over a single pin, instead of scoring points they can place this pin in one of the two defense zones near the back of the playing area.&#10;&#10;If a player's score equals exactly 70 points, they win. If a player would score points and go over 70, then they instead lose points equal to the sum of the numbers on the pins, regardless of how many pins they dropped.&#10;&#10;The game continues until one player reaches exactly 70 points and wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "This description's a bit tricky, so let's take it in stages...&#10;&#10;Countermay: The Tapestry of Worlds, the crossroads of civilizations beyond imagining. After a thousand years of war, Countermay is dying. Battles, curses, extraterrestrial parasites, demonic influence, and other hazards have ruined much of the planet. The food is running out, and the threat of starvation looms. The only way to save Countermay is to seize undisputed control. Until then, armies march, fed with the ever-dwindling food as they churn farmland into mud with their boots. Can you save Countermay from its invitable doom?&#10;&#10;Romance of the Nine Empires is a fictitious interactive collectible card game (CCG) set in the fantasy world of Countermay. In the game, players assume command of one of nine vastly different warring factions &mdash; including steampunk aliens, a dark god-king's crusade of conversion, displaced WWII-era American GIs, and a risen empire of the undead &mdash; to expand, glorify, or defend their empires. Through its fictitious fifteen-year history, players have shaped the world of Countermay through their individual and collective achievements, and the results are reflected in the story and the current state of the empires. That concept was inspired by the Legend of the Burning Sands CCG, which in turn is based on the Legend of the Five Rings CCG: in those real-life games, tournament results affect the actual story in future expansions.&#10;&#10;The plot of the 2013 movie The Gamers: Hands of Fate revolves around the fictitious game.  Within the movie itself, AEG was the publisher of the game, but as a result of Kickstarter funding for The Gamers: Hands of Fate, it decided to create a real-life version of R9E.  The real-life release is not a collectable game, but a boxed set with a set distribution of cards. This boxed set represents the fictitious 15th Anniversary World Championship Edition of Romance of the Nine Empires, and (to slip into the movie storyline for a second) it holds the decks used by the top-placing characters for each faction that made it to the quarterfinals at the 2012 World Championships at Gen Con Indy.&#10;&#10;So there's 3 levels of reality at play here:&#10;&#10;&#10;     the CCG game called Romance of the Nine Empires, pictured in the movie The Gamers: Hands of Fate, which is played by the characters at Gen Con Indy 2012 and is 15 years old;&#10;     the fantasy world of Countermay, which is pictured in the CCG game and whose history is shaped by the players of the CCG game;&#10;     the real card game Romance of the Nine Empires, edited by AEG in 2013, which comes in a boxed set and is inspired by (and presented as) the fictitious CCG.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

At the beginning of a round, each player gets a character. This character consists of 1 nationality, 1 drink and 1 localization and, inevitably, 1 gesture and 1 word he has to pronounce when they clink glasses. The cards &ldquo;aperitif&rdquo; are mixed and posed face hidden in the center of the table. They consist also of 3 characteristics, but are mixed this time (f.e. a German drinks champagne in front of Big Ben). The active player turns over a card &ldquo;aperitif&rdquo;. It is necessary to look at it well if one of your characteristics is on the card which has been just turned over; you will have to make the gesture associated with the drink and to pronounce the word associated with the nationality of that character. Inevitably, it is the fastest player who will win the card. &#10;The game ends when all &ldquo;aperitif&rdquo; cards have been played.&#10;&#10;Home Page: http://www.guillaumegames.com/Jeux/TchinTchin/TchinTchinAccueil.htm&#10;&#10;",

That theater saw two major campaigns: one in which the forces of the British Empire contested control of the vital Suez Canal and Jerusalem regions with the Ottoman Turks and their German allies; and the Arab Revolt, in which Thomas E. Lawrence (&quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;) took a leading role. Both campaigns featured several of the major mobile actions of the Great War. At stake was nothing less than control of the entire Middle East.&#10;&#10;The game has two players: the Allies (British and Arab Rebels) and Central Powers (Ottoman Turks and Germans). Players move and attack with their units in their own discrete turns. The objective is to capture critical cities and thereby win the war in this theater. The game map is divided into two theaters, the Western and Eastern, in which separate campaigns are conducted.&#10;&#10;No Prisoners also includes an optional alternative command system, in which both players control opposing British and Central Powers units in the two map sectors, in the same manner as in old-SPI's classic Battle for Germany game. In that option, the two maps' Allied forces race against each other for victory.&#10;&#10;Each hexagon on the map equals 12.4 miles (20 kilometers) across, and each game turn represents three months of operations. The units of maneuver for both sides are primarily regiments, brigades and divisions. There are 176 large-size (5/8&quot;) NATO-style (and some iconic) unit-counters in the game.&#10;&#10;",

Your goal is to build a commercial empire and corner the market in the resources valued by intelligent beings everywhere.&#10;&#10;Empyrean, Inc. is a self-contained card game for 2 to 4 players, Ages 9 and up. All the game artwork is by Studio Foglio.&#10;&#10;You begin a game of Empyrean, Inc. with a single planet under your control - your Home Planet. Each turn, that planet produces resources which you draw from three different card stacks, representing farm resources, mine resources, and factory resources. Each class contains four individual resources, like Nutragoo, Tritium, and Robots. Spend these resources to claim new planets, adding to your production in future turns. Or buy action cards that give random but powerful benefits. You can also trade resources with your fellow players.&#10;&#10;Or you might want to hold onto them, because once you have three of a particular resource in your hand, you can lay them down in front of you. Once you've laid a resource down, you can add additional cards to the set as you get them. When the set contains seven cards, you've cornered that resource. Corner enough resources and you win the game!&#10;&#10;You win a game of Empyrean, Inc. by being the first player to corner the market in 2, 3 or 4 different resources, depending on the number of players in the game. Cornering a resource means building a set of seven cards of that resource face up in front of you.&#10;&#10;",

In Fantasy Warriors there's much more to battle than launching your army in a head on attack - discover the perils and rewards of scouting, boasts, omens, threats and, of course, magic.&#10;&#10;Each player controls an army, headed by a war chief who issues orders to the troops under his command.  Giving the right orders and changing them when the moment is right is the essence of generalship in Fantasy Warriors.  How well will you do in the battle of wits between opposing players?&#10;&#10;You can play the game with forces of any size, from small skirmishes of 20 to 40 figures a side to epic clashes between several armies, containing hundreds of figures.  Battles may be fought between two players, each with an army, or groups of players forming tabletop alliances.  You don't need any sort of referee or games master.&#10;&#10;There's no book keeping in Fantasy Warriors and, after you have decided on your forces, there's no need for pencil and paper.  Once the battle is under way, the colourful counters supplied with the game will give you all the information you need.&#10;&#10;From the back of the box:&#10;&#10;Fantasy Warriors is a complete game set for playing exciting fantasy wargames with finely detailed Grenadier miniatures - all you need to provide is a table and the desire to enjoy yourself.  The set contains: two armies [dwarves and orcs] (102 figures) of plastic Grenadier miniatures; around 140 colourful game-play counters; comprehensive rulebook; unique day/night timedial; [5] high quality dice; quick reference sheet; inch/millimetre game ruler.&#10;&#10;Components&#10;&#10;     102 Plastic Miniatures&#10;     51 Plastic Shields&#10;     5 Dice&#10;     150 Order Counters&#10;     56-page Rulebook&#10;     Quick Reference Sheet&#10;     A very flimsy box&#10;&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Fantasy Warriors Companion&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Of course, you can negociate the use and the target of that cards.&#10;&#10;When you end your turn, you draw or discard until you have seven cards.&#10;&#10;At the end of the round, there are revealed two cards from the 'news' deck, which are some special effects in the game like one worker goes to the jail, or one kind of bussines are not working.&#10;&#10;Then you get the money from your bussines cards and pay the agreements you had done (the agreements are mandatory).&#10;&#10;The richer player at the end of the game is the winner.&#10;&#10;All the name of the workers are 'spanish-word-joke'.&#10;&#10;The people in the bank-notes are friends and family of the designer.&#10;&#10;&#10;&quot;V&iacute;stete para la ocasi&oacute;n, ten el maletero de tu coche a punto y un buen pu&ntilde;ado de balas...&#10;&#10;Sum&eacute;rgete en los bajos fondos de la ciudad para controlar los negocios de la familia, ordena a tus secuaces que extorsionen en los barrios, influye sobre las leyes y g&aacute;nate a la polic&iacute;a.
