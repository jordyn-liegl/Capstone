    "description": "6 June 1944: While German Troops battled for their lives on the Eastern Front, all remained quiet in the West.  The long anticipated allied invasion seemed particularly unlikely along this portion of French Coast known as Normandy.  But this was D-Day, and the unlikely was soon to become reality.  As the vast Allied armada came into view, as Allied munitions began to burst upon the quiet French beach and among the German strong-points, the greatest drama in military history began to unfold.&#10;&#10;This game simulates this historical conflict on a five-section map representing the actual area, across which cardboard playing pieces move and engage through an hexagonal grid, which functions like the squares of a chessboard in the outcome of each combat and the success of failure of various game operations.&#10;&#10;Atlantic Wall is a battalion-level game of the D-Day invasion.  This is a monster game as it comes with five 34&quot; x 22&quot; maps and over 2000 counters.&#10;&#10;",

As mages, players can of course see into the market futures to gain an edge in their trading. However, your skills at this are somewhat limited, as things will not always go according to your predictions. The game makes use of a unique and eye-catching crystal ball mechanism (inspired by the cube tower in Wallenstein, Shogun, and Amerigo) ensuring no market prediction is a sure bet!&#10;&#10;Also beware, each mage is armed with an array of spells that can affect the market in unpredictable ways, thwarting the other mages' plans! Clever and timely use of these spells will turn the markets in your favor, while frustrating your opponents' plans.&#10;&#10;In addition to the potion market, the High Council also has its own demands and interests in the markets. However, due to their immense power, they have been banned from the trading floor, and must purchase their potion directly from other mages. They will be a good source of income for the mages, and reward the markets if they get what they need; but beware, they'll also do their best to crash the values of those potions they fail to receive!&#10;&#10;The mage that is able to earn the most money through cunning investments, shrewd spell-casting, and timely sales to the High Council will be the most successful potion trader and win the game!&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Secret Night at Davis Manor is a team-based board game set in 1928 York, England. It takes place in Davis Manor. Players secretly take on the role of police and thieves, and they must co-operate to achieve their objectives: The thieves have to take the money and escape with it in a vehicle, while the police have to arrest the thieves.&#10;&#10;Script: England, 1928, following a period of scarcity in the wake of the first world war, Europe is experiencing a period of artistic and economic splendor.&#10;&#10;In celebration of this new era of prosperity a grand dinner has been organised at the Davis Manor. The greatest Luminaries and elites of the time are set to attend, however all is not what it seems!&#10;&#10;The police have received warning that a master thief is planning to attend the event and steal the Davis Manor fortune. This thief is rumoured to never act alone, pulling off heists using hidden accomplices.&#10; Instead of cancelling the event a daring plan has been hatched! The chief inspector himself will attend the party, along with hidden detective agents. Using their skills, cunning and powers of deduction they will attempt to catch a thief! But be careful.. Not everyone is as they seem in Davis Manor and a lot can happen in the Secret Night.&#10;&#10;How to play resume:&#10;&#10;Roles: The Master Thief and the Chief Inspector reveal their roles and keep them shown.The rest of the players will keep their roles hidden.&#10;&#10;Characters: Each character has a special skill.&#10;&#10;The mansion: There are 16 rooms in the mansion.They are represented by their names on the perimeter of the Main Board. At the beginning of the game the object cards are shuffled (green circle at the back) and 16 of them are randomly placed face up in each room held by the Main Board. The rest of the object cards are stacked face down as a draw deck.&#10;&#10;Mechanics: Draw one card, spin the roulette to move the pawn around the board by the number rolled, and perform actions with object cards and/or the Action Square.&#10;&#10;During their movement, the player can do as many actions as they wants/are able to.&#10;&#10;The most common action is to perform a search. Being on a green search hex gives you the opportunity to take the card stored in the associated room slot on the edge of the Main Board.&#10;&#10;Once checked, you should keep one of the cards in your hand (at your choice) in the slot of the room hidden face down.&#10;&#10;Inventory: The maximum number of cards at the end of your turn is 3, and 1 must always be shown face up next to the player board (even if you only have 1 card in total).&#10;&#10;Action square: Once per turn, when you are next to another pawn, you may use the Action Square to perform an action:&#10;&#10;-To Trade cards with another player, either, 1 for 1 , 2 for 2 or 3 for 3.&#10;&#10;-To Steal a card: The target victim shuffles all his cards (shown and hidden) before he is robbed. The player performing the action then chooses 1 card blindly.&#10;&#10;-Push: Move a player up to 2 squares. If he encounters an obstacle: (wall, other player) stops.&#10;&#10;-Whisper a secret: Use it to have a private conversation (whispering to the ear) with another player. This can be useful for plotting strategies or bluffing.&#10;&#10;In addition to these actions, players may use the object cards.&#10;&#10;End of the game: The game ends at dawn (9 turns - 6:00 am) or when a team's score counter reaches 10 points. If the game ends in a tie and the Deceiver (the role for games with odd players) is not in play, the first team to score wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Fanorona is a classical two-person strategic abstract game that comes from the island of Madagascar and is still popular there today. It is played on a rectangular board made up of two Alquerque boards with 22 plain black and white pieces. Capturing is compulsory and a series of captures may be made by the same piece on a turn, as in checkers. Unique aspects of the game include its method of capture (either approaching or withdrawing your piece from a line of enemy pieces), and the &quot;vela partie&quot; (debt game) after winning a decisive game (the winner must let the loser &quot;eat&quot; one man each turn for 17 consecutive moves). Because of the density of the board (only one open spot at the games beginning) and the unique method of capture, strategy is complex and enigmatic, with fewer pieces often beating more pieces. (While very different, the game feels somewhat like Zertz due to the above.)&#10;&#10;Historical note from one game box: Some Fanorona matches were devoted to the Gods and last but not least the fate and colonialization of Madagascar (1895) supposed to be solved unbloody with Fanorona on the game table.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "On June 6th, 1942, Erich von Manstein&rsquo;s 11th Army began its last assault on the besieged Soviet fortress of Sevastopol, the latest episode in the German conquest of the Crimean Peninsula, which was initiated in September 1941. The operation, code named St&ouml;rfang, was also the prelude to the German summer offensive of 1942, freeing the troops committed in Crimea for other tasks and securing the southern flank of the attacking armies towards the Volga.&#10;&#10;Von Manstein&rsquo;s Triumph is a game for two players that simulate the final assault on the fortress&ndash;port. This is a card driven game (symbolizing orders, historical events and equipment) in which both players maneuver their forces, made up of wooden blocks, over the Map Board, which depicts the battlefield divided into areas for positioning and movement purposes. Key to victory is the control of Victory Point areas, which represent the critical points of the defense.&#10;&#10;Victory is determined at the end of the game with the player having most Victory Points (VPs) being the winner. VPs are printed on the Map Board inside the red banners. A player controls the VPs printed in an area if that player controls the area. Initially all VPs are controlled by the Soviet player, so the Axis player has to attack the areas containing them to gain VPs. The Axis player loses VPs when receiving reinforcements. If both players have exactly the same number of VPs at the end of the game then this results in a draw.&#10;&#10;One player takes the role of the German Commander in Chief of the 11th Army (Erich von Manstein) and has to take key locations in the Fortress-city of Sevastopol, defended by the Soviet Independent Coastal Army (commanded by Ivan Efimovich Petrov).&#10;&#10;As the attacker you will have to plan carefully your assaults to maximize the damage you inflict of the sizable Soviet forces. The battle, initially, will be a meat grinder of attrition, be careful of earlier penetrations into the Soviet defenses as they are very able to counterattack... So, you have to thin out the Soviet defenders to prepare the way for a breakout and a battle of exploitation that will led you to the Victory Point sites.&#10;&#10;As the Soviet player you have to trade men for time. Your main weapon is numbers and the field and permanent fortifications of the outer ring around the fortress. So, you have to contest every inch of ground and slowly give up positions to make the German run out of time: Hitler is watching and he needs troops and assets to begin his Fall Blau summer offensive...&#10;&#10;Will you run out of time as assaulting German or will you be able to take the Fortress in time...? It is a race against the clock.&#10;&#10;Cards allow players to make troops move, assault, counterattack during the enemy player-turn, influence the combats and make air and artillery bombardments. Romanian troops and Mountain troops will be present as well as the &quot;elite&quot; Soviet Naval Infantry brigades, so often used for counterattacks and shoring up breaches in the line... Even an NKVD regiment with extra motivation for not give up their positions.&#10;&#10;MAIN CHARACTERISTICS&#10;&#10;&bull; It only takes 2 hours to recreate this desperate struggle.&#10;&bull; Players have to fight not only against each other but also against the time.&#10;&bull; Simple rules and card driven game.&#10;&bull; The game components are of the highest quality, highlighting the 2x2 cm wooden blocks, the cards and the board.&#10;&bull; Historical accuracy.

Using the investigation speed indicated on the card each player has in hand, players take turns guessing which player (whether yourself or someone else) holds the &quot;Lost Legacy&quot; card; this card might also be in the &quot;Ruins&quot;, a location that holds one card at the start of the game and possibly acquires more cards during play.

    "description": "Red Poppies Campaigns (RPC) enables players to game WWI battles from the perspective of battalion and regimental command posts.  Players unleash opening bombardments and then maneuver infantry companies against machine gun fire to fight battles on historically accurate maps of actual battlefields.  The streamlined system for fire and movement enables a rapid ebb and flow with minimal dice rolling and lots of historical chrome.  Generally speaking, units can move or fire once per turn &ndash; machine gun fire is the notable, unpredictable exception &ndash; and can initiate melee after a move.  Fire resolution requires only one dice roll, made by the target and modified for the relevant circumstances such as incoming firepower, terrain, visibility, etc.  Throughout, players must effectively manage the dynamic tension between top down control and bottom up initiative to get their units onto the objective before their ever-eroding control crumbles to nil.&#10;&#10;A tragic irony of WWI unifies all aspects of game play.  For most of the war, effective command and control of tactical units required a degree of concentration which threatened their survival.  In other words, the game illustrates the inverse relationship between a unit&rsquo;s responsiveness to orders and its durability.  So players must &ldquo;form&rdquo; infantry units to get them moving and then &ldquo;disperse&rdquo; them at the right moment to hold the ground gained.  Enemy fire can force premature dispersion which must be remedied to get an attack moving again.  For infantry, the formed condition represents troops arrayed for the convenience of top down command such as those deployed in skirmish line or a column-of-march while the dispersed condition represents troops spread out and hunkered down for their own survival.&#10;&#10;The game illustrates the evolution of tactics during WWI.  In time, gas wafts across the battlefield, unit statistics change to show better performance while dispersed, a new method of tactical command and control (the &ldquo;blob&rdquo;) emerges, mortars pop up like mushrooms after the rain, and artillery becomes more responsive.  In addition to short, standalone scenarios, RPC has a &ldquo;campaign&rdquo; mechanism so players can link a series of interdependent scenarios to simulate battles that spanned days, and nights.  During these campaigns, the results of one scenario affect the start of another so conservation of force, supply lines, and replacements all become issues.  Players will get a sense of slogging forward in yards per day - at great cost &ndash; as they plot days of grinding combat.&#10;&#10;Product Information&#10;&#10;     Complexity:                 6 out of 10&#10;     Solitaire suitability:      8 out of 10&#10;     Time Scale:                 10 minutes per turn&#10;     Map Scale:                  200 yards per hex&#10;     Unit Scale:                 Companies, squadrons, sections&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Tigers in the Mist, Ardennes Offensive, The Battle of the Bulge, December 16 - 22, 1944, this game simulates the early stages of the German offensive in the Ardennes section of Western Europe (Germany, France, Belgium, and Luxembourg) in December of 1944. Historically, the Germans planned to break through the thin American defenses in this area, cross the Meuse River, and seize the port of Antwerp in Belgium. The German high command hoped that success would force a political settlement on the Western Front, thus allowing Germany to direct its full attention to defeating the Russians. In order to win the game, the German player will almost certainly have to get some units across the Meuse River&#10;&#10;The Ardennes, a thickly wooded area on the borders of Germany, Belgium, and Luxembourg, where battle weary U.S. divisions were sent to rest and replace losses, or units freshly arrived from the United States were given their first taste of front line duty. At 5:30am, December 16, 1944, this 85-mile-long sector erupted into what would be the largest, most costly campaign on the Western Front in WWII. The Battle of the Bulge had begun.&#10;&#10;During the first week of the battle, three German armies attacked vigorously and relentlessly in an attempt to reach the Meuse River, the major geographical obstacle between them and the great port of Antwerp on the northern coast of Belgium. Stubborn resistance by outnumbered American forces in the difficult terrain of the Ardennes canceled out much of the initial material advantages and surprise the Germans enjoyed. On December 22, Patton's Third Army began attacking the German southern flank north of Arlon, and on the 23rd, the weather finally cleared, allowing Allied air supremacy to be re-asserted over the battlefield.&#10;&#10;As the German player, can you break through the American player's front lines and get sufficient forces across the Meuse River before the Allies can bring enough reinforcements to the threatened sector to stop the Ardennes Offensive? Play Tigers in the Mist and discover what might have been.&#10;&#10;From the GMT website:&#10;An impulse based movement and combat system which forces both sides to hoard reserves to respond to both opportunity and disaster on the battlefield.&#10;&#10;Four scenarios playable in one-to-five hours, including an introductory scenario, two tournament scenarios of three hour duration, and a campaign scenario which covers the first week of the battle.&#10;&#10;Rules, charts, and examples are organized for ease of use. The game system is logical and clean, making it very easy to quickly learn the mechanics of play.&#10;&#10;An unpredictable combat system which results in heavy attrition for both sides and reflects the erosion of combat power that sustained battle has on units engaged in heavy fighting day after day.&#10;&#10;Truly meaningful chrome including combined arms effects, German special forces, supply, bridge demolition and repair, entrenchments, first day surprise restrictions, and reserve division release conditions.&#10;&#10;Areas are irregularly-shaped spaces on the map. Each area represents a city, town, or crossroads. Each area is named and identified by a unique number. The area numbering system may be used to facilitate PBM or PBEM play as well as to aid in locating a particular area. The system is set up such that a numbered area is always adjacent to consecutive areas in the numbering sequence, ie. 75 is adjacent to 74 and 76. Areas are connected by roads. Brown lines are minor roads. Gray lines are major roads. Units move from area to area along roads. Units may not move to an adjacent area unless it is connected to the area moved from by a road.&#10;&#10;Republished in Command Magazine Japan #62 in 2005.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Turn: 1 day (broken into three 8 hour impulses)&#10;Area: 1&quot; = 4 miles &#10;Units: Battalion to Brigade&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 22&quot; X 34&quot; mapsheet&#10;Two countersheets (352 5/8&quot; counters)&#10;One 16 page rules booklet&#10;Five Scenario Cards&#10;One Player Aid Card&#10;Four 10 sided sided die&#10;&#10;",

From here players reveal their unique 'Life Purpose' cards and add up their scores. The highest score wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Battles of the American Revolution Series:&#10;&#10;The Siege of Pensacola pits a numerically large but fragile Spanish army, supported by a small corps of French allies against a smaller, feistier British army enjoying strong fortifications and highly mobile Indian allies. As the Spanish player you will need to determine where you will build your siege gun redoubts and will then have to protect your soldiers from raiding British units to finish the works in time to mount an effective bombardment. As the British player, you have far fewer forces, but armed with special raiding rules, your Regulars, Tories and Indian allies must harass and erode Spanish morale, while delaying the construction of Spanish siege works for as long as possible in the hope of keeping your three forts intact to face the coming coup de main.&#10;&#10;The game begins with Don Bernardo de Galvez&rsquo;s army of 5,000 having just landed on the mainland. How many forces actually are present is decided in a special phase during the initial set-up wherein that portion of the Spanish army that sailed from Havana must run the gauntlet of the Red Cliffs Fort guns. Hence, the starting forces for Spain are likely to be different for each game played as units and leaders are eliminated or delayed in their arrival. Once these forces are ashore, the Spanish player faces some hard choices. Does he send forces to take out the Red Cliffs Fort, to protect his turn 7 Spanish and French reinforcements from having to run the same gauntlet, or does the Spanish player immediately begin construction of the siege works, to achieve the longest possible bombardment before the coup de main?&#10;&#10;The British player is outnumbered, but must employ his small forces in aggressive and often risky raids to slow down siege construction, wear down Spanish morale and worry the Spanish lines of supply. Getting a small force into one of two Spanish stockades can be devastating for the Spanish. Thus, though numerically superior, the Spanish player has much to do and protect, and will often be spread thin by a well-conceived series of raids. Giving the Spanish too many siege turns to bombard your three forts and/or permitting the Spanish to launch the coup de main with high army morale is likely to spell disaster for the British player.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "In King's Pouch you take the role of a feudal lord in a kingdom divided by internal strife. After the king's death, the powerful dukes and counts of the land are fighting for supremacy. You are one of these nobles, looking to write your name in the annals of history. You will use your citizens to develop your lands, muster armies, and amass wealth. You may even try to secure the goodwill of influential public figures, like the remainders of the royal family. But never forget to keep the dishonest parts of your society in check: Excessive corruption may lead to your downfall sooner than you think. The goal is clear!&#10;&#10;But the path you take to get there is yours to decide: Will you be a peaceful protector of the royal family? Or maybe a warlord, taking what you want by force? Or will you fail to fulfill your ambitions and be lost among the anonymous masses? Take up the king's pouch and find out!&#10;&#10;King's Pouch is a &quot;pouch-building&quot; strategy game set in a medieval kingdom. Each round offers tough choices on how to expand your pool of citizens and buildings. Using the resources you acquire, you may raise powerful armies or secure the support of powerful characters. In the game, you will use several kinds of citizens (cubes and prisms) in different ways, with the ultimate goal of earning prestige points. Your pool of citizens is represented by your pouch: You draw available citizens from there and return used citizens to the pouch only when you cannot draw any more because it is empty. (This concept is similar to the deck-building concept seen in other games.)&#10;&#10;The game takes place over nine rounds. At the end of rounds 3, 6 and 9, a great council allows for the scoring of additional prestige points from influential characters and conquered territories. After the ninth round, the game ends with the third great council and a final scoring in which you can gain or lose points depending on your corrupt officials and buildings, then the player with the most prestige points wins.&#10;&#10;",

Or will the player set up a trap, thinking that the wolf will be coming for her? Once the players lay down their cards, the wolf chooses one of the players. If this player went to sleep, the wolf takes points from this player equal to the value of her character; if she set up a trap, on the other hand, she takes points from the wolf. Everyone else who rested this round scores points from the bank for their character &mdash; but only if they got their beauty sleep!&#10;&#10;Whoever lost points that round becomes the wolf for the next round and hands out the character cards to players as she wishes.

In front of the Guardian you place a set of 3 stronghold cards.  These are locations that give you bonuses.  In front of these are 3 empty spaces that terrain cards will be placed.  These will match up to the other players 3 empty spaces thus creating the board.&#10;&#10;Onto your stronghold you can place creatures under a shield to keep them hidden.  Only creatures under a shield can move and they can move up to 2 spaces with some restrictions.  There is a limit to what can be put under the shields so you can not make your army too big.&#10;&#10;When two armies met they battle.  Combat is fairly detailed.  Both players pick up their cards from under the shields to make a combat hand.  Each player secretly chooses one creature and they are placed down on the table.  The stronger then covers the weaker.  This is repeated for each creature until only one player has creatures left in his hand.  He can then assign these creatures to help any of the previous creatures placed.  There are many modifiers involved and each stack of creatures must be checked for a winner.  All losers are discarded.  After determining each battle the total strength of each army is checked.  The weaker army must then retreat or the attacker in case of a tie.&#10;&#10;To win you must either control all six of the lands between the strongholds, destroy 5 of the opponents shields or destroy the opposing Guardian.&#10;&#10;After the first release, a revised edition was published ('Guardians Revised Edition').

    "description": "On October 6, 1973 the combined forces of Syria and Egypt launched a major attack to regain their lands lost to Israel in 1967. What resulted was the most intense armored and mechanized combat since World War II. And this is what the game of BAR-LEV is all about.&#10;&#10;Using two highly detailed map boards, BAR-LEV completely captures all the fluidity of this, the Yom Kippur War. Everything is there. For the Israelis you have battalions of Centurions, M60, M48 and Super-Sherman tanks plus a wide variety of mechanized infantry. Also, you have all their artillery to support this fast moving array. For their big counterattack, the Israelis will be using everything from the long ranging 175mm guns to captured Russian 130mm cannons.&#10;&#10;In the air, the combat is equally exciting. The Air Module is almost a complete game in itself. Once again everything is there. The Israelis have Mirage IIIs, Skyhawks and the deadly Phantoms; all individually represented. There are even separate counters for both Huey and Chinook helicopters.&#10;&#10;And now pouring across the canal and up the Golan Heights come the Arabs. With their low silhouette T-62s and fast moving BTR personal carriers, they represent a formidable challenge to Israel.&#10;&#10;And they too are accurately represented, complete with Saggar anti-tank missiles and both mobile and fixed SAM sites. Their air force also has individual counters for the MIG-21s, 19s, and a few 23s, in addition to SU-7 and SU-11s. They too, have their divisional and corp level artillery. All of it is there.&#10;&#10;BAR-LEV is not just another scenario, but the most complete and accurate simulation of modern air and mechanized combat yet designed. Each major participant has over a 150 military counters.&#10;&#10;BAR-LEV is played in daily turns and may be fought with or without a &quot;cease-fire&quot;. It is an open-ended game, with the &quot;what-ifs&quot; limited only by your imagination. And now, it is 0700 hours, October 6, 1973 and the fate of the Mid-East is in your hands.&#10;&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;* Map&#10;* Ground Module rulebook&#10;* Air Module rulebook&#10;* 450 counters&#10;&#10;Inspired Frank Chadwick's Bar-Lev 1977 game which  included updated graphics and new concepts such as Headquarters, Allocation Points...&#10;&#10;Which in turn inspired Chris Fawcett's Bar-Lev 2019 game with even more enhancements.&#10;&#10;(back cover and user's description)&#10;&#10;",

Maharaja,  but more than that you need proof that those antiques form a collection and aren't merely a hodgepodge of old trinkets.&#10;&#10;To set up the game, shuffle the 36 antique cards (six types in six colors), lay out four on the table, give each player 4-5 rupees (depending on turn order), and lay out the fifteen collection cards. Place the trade cards &mdash; numbered 4-3-3-2-2 in a four-player game &mdash; on the table in a row, then place a gold coin worth 3 rupees on each trade card.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player either takes the leftmost gold coin from a trade card or pays the cost shown on the leftmost trade card bearing a coin to purchase one of the antique cards on display. After doing either of these, the player can claim a collection card as long as they own the antiques depicted on that card; many collection cards force you to discard one of the antiques depicted, which then sets you back toward claiming other collection cards. To end your turn, pay taxes so that you have at most 8 rupees. As soon as all the gold coins are claimed or the antique cards purchased, the round ends, after which you refill the trade cards and lay out four new antique cards.&#10;&#10;Once the antique cards run out, the game ends and players discard any antique cards they hold if they have only one card of that color. Then they tally their scores based on their collection and antique cards and the money they still hold. Whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "From the Avalanche Press website:&#10;&#10;In the spring of 1940, the French Army appeared invincible. They awaited the expected German offensive with great confidence, ready to repel their ancient foes and overwhelm them in 1941 with a massive wave of new armored divisions. Instead it was the German panzers that did the overwhelming. Despite heroic efforts in which over 90,000 French soldiers lost their lives, within six weeks France had fallen.&#10;&#10;1940 - The Fall of France is a stand-alone game in the Panzer Grenadier series.  You do not need any other game in the series to play any of the 50 scenarios. Design is by wargame veteran Philippe Leonard of Belgium, who has crafted scenarios involving the French Army on the attack and on the defense, with units ranging from the elite Foreign Legion and Coloniale to the pitiful second-line reserves.&#10;&#10;Pieces include the huge array of French armor: S35 cavalry tanks, B1-bis heavy tanks, FT17, R35, R40, H39. H35 and FCM 36 light tanks. Panhard, AMR33, P16 and AMR35 armored cars and reconnaissance tanks. Plus the bizarre C2 multi-turreted heavy tank. Plus many types of troops and support weapons, from motorcycle troops and horsed cavalry through the awesome 155mm GPF rifle.&#10;&#10;The Germans receive their full set of panzers, from the puny PzKw I through the PzKw IIIE and 38t. There are vehicles not seen before in the Panzer Grenadier series like the SiG33 assault gun, and a set of pieces for Infantry Regiment Grossdeutschland in their own colors.&#10;&#10;There are eight semi-rigid mapboards, the same type as those found in Eastern Front, created by Guy Riessen, who crafted the widely-praised maps for Elsenborn Ridge.&#10;&#10;",

All students and the Anomaly execute their movement behind a player screen, so it's rare to know exactly where another player is. Students will try to signal their location to the other students using location hint cards, and the Anomaly in turn will use these cards to triangulate the students' positions.&#10;&#10;The Anomaly needs to feed to stay alive, either on the fuel or the students themselves. The students will be working to destroy the Anomaly's fuel sources, and to damage it with improvised weapons like traps and stun batons.

The cards have inverse abilities for the Anomaly that will give it new powers, like Possess or Teleport.

All the major combat ships in the Axis and Allied navies are portrayed in the game in a simple (but not simplistic) simulation of the war on a strategic level with most of the tactical details represented by simple game mechanics. The resulting game is fast-paced and fun to play, while remaining true to history.&#10;&#10;Much of AW has some similarity to the mechanics used in Avalon Hill's classic game Victory in The Pacific (VITP), applying a modern application to the sea wars in both the Atlantic and the Pacific. This game combines both theaters into one game.&#10;&#10;Players familiar with these older titles will immediately notice that the map-board representing the Pacific has some similarities to its predecessor, whereas the map for the Atlantic theater has greatly changed. This was done to more seamlessly combine the mechanics of the two games, and to better reflect the nature of the Atlantic naval fighting.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Now it's time to flee, ideally making it out with both our treasures and our lives.&#10;&#10;On each turn, a player can either advance boldly, flee cautiously, or cry like a baby. If you advance boldly, you draw a card from the location deck, which holds three types of cards: one that allows that player to either redraw or stop, one that grants new treasure from the treasure hall, and (of course) the dragon. If you draw the dragon, you lose one health point (out of two), the dragon calms down (i.e., it loses one temper point), and the location deck is reshuffled. If you're injured twice, you die and are out of the game.&#10;&#10;When fleeing cautiously, you first discard a treasure worth at least one coin, then roll a d10. If your roll is higher than the number of cards in the location deck, the dragon calms down, then you reshuffle the location deck; otherwise you must draw a card from the location deck just as when someone advances boldly. Your sacrificed treasure is still lost.&#10;&#10;When you cry like a baby, you don't draw a location card, instead discarding a treasure worth at least two coins. Having shown your obeisance to the dragon, the turn passes to the next player.&#10;&#10;Players start with four treasure cards; while some cards are worth 1-5 coins, others provide a one-shot potion or a talisman that stays in effect until the location deck is shuffled, which ends the round. Gameplay lasts from 5 to 8 rounds. Each player has a unique power that can be used once per round: the thief can steal cards from opponents, the cleric can heal opponents in exchange for treasure, etc. If the dragon loses its final temper point, the game ends and whoever holds the most valuable treasure wins; if all of the adventurers are charred to death first, then the dragon wins instead!&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "In 1592, Japanese Taikou (&#229;&#164;&#170;&#233;&#150;&#163;) Toyotomi Hideyoshi showed his great ambition to conquer China (Ming Dynasty). His proposal to Korea (Joseon Dynasty) to march through their territory was denied, and there began The Imjin War.&#10;&#10;In Far East War 1592, players are divided into Japan and China/Korea factions, with each side trying to conquer the target provinces of their rivals. Players alternate to move around the action roundel to perform different actions such as recruit forces, assign generals, march armies, initiate battles, etc. With careful planning on the action roundel, tactical movement and assignment of troops and generals, and a bit luck in dice roll during battles, players should revive the vivid history in the Far East War.&#10;&#10;&#229;&#156;&#168;1592&#233;&#128;&#153;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#229;&#185;&#180;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#230;&#172;&#138;&#229;&#130;&#190;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#230;&#153;&#130;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#232;&#177;&#144;&#232;&#135;&#163;&#231;&#167;&#128;&#229;&#144;&#137;&#233;&#135;&#142;&#229;&#191;&#131;&#230;&#188;&#171;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#230;&#151;&#165;&#230;&#156;&#172;&#230;&#156;&#172;&#229;&#179;&#182;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#229;&#144;&#145;&#230;&#156;&#157;&#233;&#174;&#174;&#230;&#143;&#144;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#229;&#129;&#135;&#233;&#129;&#147;&#229;&#133;&#165;&#230;&#152;&#142;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#231;&#139;&#130;&#229;&#166;&#132;&#232;&#166;&#129;&#230;&#177;&#130;&#227;&#128;&#130;20&#232;&#144;&#172;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#232;&#187;&#141;&#232;&#168;&#136;&#231;&#149;&#171;&#231;&#169;&#191;&#233;&#129;&#142;&#230;&#156;&#157;&#233;&#174;&#174;&#229;&#141;&#138;&#229;&#179;&#182;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#230;&#148;&#187;&#230;&#137;&#147;&#230;&#152;&#142;&#230;&#156;&#157;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#229;&#190;&#129;&#230;&#156;&#141;&#230;&#149;&#180;&#229;&#128;&#139;&#230;&#157;&#177;&#228;&#186;&#158;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#233;&#128;&#153;&#229;&#160;&#180;&#228;&#186;&#158;&#230;&#180;&#178;&#231;&#137;&#136;&#228;&#184;&#137;&#229;&#156;&#139;&#229;&#191;&#151;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#229;&#190;&#158;&#230;&#181;&#183;&#228;&#184;&#138;&#230;&#137;&#147;&#229;&#136;&#176;&#233;&#153;&#184;&#229;&#156;&#176;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#229;&#131;&#181;&#230;&#140;&#129;&#228;&#186;&#134;&#232;&#182;&#133;&#233;&#129;&#142;6&#229;&#185;&#180;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#229;&#143;&#178;&#231;&#168;&#177;&#229;&#163;&#172;&#232;&#190;&#176;&#229;&#128;&#173;&#228;&#186;&#130;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#150;&#135;&#231;&#165;&#191;/&#230;&#133;&#182;&#233;&#149;&#183;&#228;&#185;&#139;&#229;&#189;&#185;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#232;&#144;&#172;&#230;&#155;&#134;&#230;&#156;&#157;&#233;&#174;&#174;&#228;&#185;&#139;&#229;&#189;&#185;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#228;&#189;&#134;&#230;&#156;&#128;&#231;&#130;&#186;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#231;&#159;&#165;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#231;&#168;&#177;&#229;&#145;&#188;&#231;&#130;&#186;&#239;&#188;&#154;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#229;&#163;&#172;&#232;&#190;&#176;&#228;&#185;&#139;&#230;&#136;&#176;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;

Jacques and Marie, a couple of rabbits, want to secure a quick profit on Carotte Orange SCA shares. Felipe, the shark, tries to convince Karl, the pig, that Peixe Azul S.A. It's a good deal, but the pig is only interested in Roter Apfel AG, whose shares have already earned him good profits recently. Hank the bull is confident of Green Grass Inc.'s rising profits, but Sofia the bear prefers to be more cautious and make a safe investment in Miele Giallo S.p.A. Finally, Harshad, the wolf, tries to convince everyone that he is a successful investor, but there are rumors that he became a millionaire with a pyramid scheme. Before the Exchange closes its operations, anything can happen! Who will raise both arms and shout &ldquo;STONKS!&rdquo; in celebration?&#10;&#10;Stonks it's a trick taking and stock market game. One of the players leads the trick by playing a card and everyone must follow suit. Whoever played the highest card wins the trick and chooses one of the played cards to put in the wallet. All cards have shares, which yield victory points according to the companies' market value. Some cards, when used, allow the player to modify a company's stock exchange rate, either in his favor or to ruin  opponents dreams. After all cards are used, the player with the most victory points is the winner.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "From the turn of the 20th century, Chicago's Union Station rose to prominence as one of the busiest and most used train station hubs in the United States. At one point, five railroad companies each owned stock in the Chicago Union Station Co, collaborating to build the greatest train station at the time.&#10;&#10;Union Station is a quick-playing cube rails game, focusing more on share purchasing and stock manipulation than route building. On your turn you may either buy stock and increase its value, sell all of your stock to get quick cash while also lowering the company's value, or lay track. While the shares might come out randomly, it's all about careful timing and the willingness to drop something good for something even better.&#10;&#10;The game ends immediately when all of the Shares have been bought or sold off, 20 dividends have been paid, or railroad companies cannot lay any additional track. The players add together their cash in hand to the value of each of their shares, and the player with the most money wins.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

In an all-out attempt to defeat Russia and end World War Two, the Germans managed to see the spires of the Kremlin as their high water mark for both this battle and for the war. Over two million men fought in this desperate battle that would decide the war and the future of mankind.&#10;&#10;Masahiro Yamazaki, the designer of the MMP games Red Star Rising and Stalingrad Pocket has designed his greatest game on this great conflict- Last Stand; The Battle for Moscow 1941-1942. Using all the tricks in his designer&rsquo;s bag, Mas has made this titanic struggle playable but without sacrificing a great sense of history. Offering 3 scenarios to show different aspects of the campaign, and a unique way of showing the plight of the Soviet morale as a nation faces possible complete military defeat, all in a manageable size, Last Stand is a game that has no competitor.&#10;&#10;As seen in Mas&rsquo; other games, Last Stand features an interesting sequence of play:&#10;&#10;&#10;    A.) German Player Turn&#10;        ) Supply Phase&#10;            a.) Weather&#10;            b.) Reinforcement/Supply Placement&#10;            c.) Receive Air Points&#10;            d.) Combat Unit Supply Check&#10;            e.) Isolated Attrition Check&#10;            f.) Supply Unit Removal (Snow Turns)&#10;            g.) Soviet Morale Chit Pull (if applicable)&#10;        &#10;        ) Movement Phase&#10;            a.) Unit Movement/Overrun&#10;            b.) Supply Unit Consumption&#10;        &#10;        ) Combat Phase&#10;            a.) Resolve Combat&#10;            b.) Remove Supply Units in Expend Mode&#10;        &#10;        ) Soviet Reaction Phase (The Soviet Player is allowed to move and overrun with eligible Mechanized units)&#10;        ) Exploitation Movement (all German units may move again with one half of their movement allowance) &#10;    &#10;    B.) Soviet Player Turn&#10;        ) Supply Phase&#10;            a.) Reinforcement HQ and Combat Unit Placement&#10;            b.) Receive Air Points&#10;            c.) Combat Unit Supply Check&#10;            d.) Isolated Attrition Check&#10;            e.) Red Army Morale Check&#10;        &#10;        ) Katyusha Gun Phase&#10;            a.) Katyusha movement&#10;            b.) Katyusha Fire&#10;        &#10;        ) Movement Phase&#10;        ) German Reaction Phase (Like the Soviets in his reaction phase, but with different parameters, the German player may conduct reaction move with his eligible Mechanized units).&#10;        ) Combat Phase&#10;            a.)

As the game begins, neither player knows what they must accomplish to win the game. As the game progresses and the Germans advance towards Moscow, the Germans will find out what it takes to win. Soviet Morale will continue to fall until the Soviets can strike back - and when they do, the damage is healed twofold - but defeat can happen at any moment.&#10;&#10;Last Stand features three scenarios of different lengths to give players options depending on how much time they have to play.&#10;&#10;Scenario One - the Soviet Counterblow&#10;This scenario covers only the great Soviet Counterattack that pushed the Germans to the brink of defeat in the late Winter 1942. Playing time is about 3-4 hours.&#10;&#10;Scenario Two - The Germans Attack&#10;This scenario covers the German attack to defeat the Soviets before winter comes. Playing time is about 5-6 hours.&#10;&#10;Scenario Three - the Campaign Game&#10;This scenario covers the entire offensive and the Soviet counterattack. Combining both scenario one and two together, this has a playing time of about 10 hours.&#10;&#10;Last Stand components:&#10;One 34 by 22 map &#10;560 &frac12;&quot; counters &#10;32 page full color rulebook &#10;2 player aids&#10;&#10;Game Details:&#10;Solitaire Rating: very good to excellent &#10;Complexity: Medium &#10;Playing Time: 3-10 hours &#10;Scenarios: 3 &#10;Game scale: Units are divisions, turns are ten days, and hexes are 17.2 kilometers across.&#10;&#10;",

Now, the administrators of Armorica try to increase their prestige by attracting wealthy Romans immigrants. However, Roman Patricians have expensive tastes, and it will take a lot of development to make a barbaric province like Armorica appealing.&#10;&#10;Armorica is the third game in Vainglorious Games' Celtic Nations series.  It is a challenging card-drafting game, in which players must anticipate the likely choices of their opponents in order to win.  Each turn, players select cards from face up displays and add them to their personal tableaus.  Icons in player's personal tableaus increase the range of cards from which they can select, allow them to retain more cards in their tableaus, and provide different sources of victory points.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Diceborn Heroes is a 1&ndash;4 player fantasy dice game similar to the old school JRPGs. Players control a party of heroes whose quests send them to far off lands facing monsters to protect innocent bystanders. They must band together to gain strength and defeat the evils that plagued the fair lands of Dievalice. After each encounter, players will have a chance to level up their classes and learn new skills, giving them more abilities and dice to use in the upcoming battles.&#10;&#10;Players choose 1&ndash;2 heroes to control on a team of 3&ndash;4 heroes and gather a green die for each one, then add 4 attack cards per hero to make an attack deck. Following the setup on the quest card players would then reveal a monster card for each hero into the center. Players roll a pool of dice then assign one to an available attack slot on their hero card(s). Once all dice are assigned players reveal an attack card for each monster then resolve attacks from the lowest to the highest value of card or die. Enemies target the hero that has an assigned die that is equal to or greater than their attack card value. Heroes choose enemies to target and can use hero abilities at any point to gain an edge in battle. After all attacks the attack cards are discarded and heroes gather their dice again, roll and assign all over.&#10;&#10;Defeated enemies add cards back into the attack deck; if the deck runs out, heroes start taking additional damage. Once all enemies are defeated, Heroes have the opportunity to buy items and choose the next quest that matches the symbol on their quest card. They also level up by either flipping over their hero card and either taking an ability from one of those cards or covering up the bottom with a new class card.&#10;&#10;Together you will either win and defeat the boss or have your party get knocked out by the overwhelming peril. If you win the next time you play the choices you made before will affect the next generation of heroes. Relics that you previously found on quests get added to the item deck and the enemy attack cards that you added will stay and affect the next generation of heroes. The choices you make will continue the story.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Diner is a fast-paced game about waiters in a friendly competition to make the most money in tips. Take orders for the tables in your section, gather the plates to fill those orders, and serve your tables, and do it as quickly as possible while showing up the other players.&#10;&#10;Diner features a pseudo-real time mechanic that has players passing action tokens whenever they take an action; if a player does not have a token, that player can't take an action. At times, action tokens may accumulate in front of a player, allowing them to take multiple actions at once.&#10;&#10;Diner is the winner of the Dice Hate Me Games 54-Card Challenge - a contest that challenged designers to create a game using only 54 cards and very minimal components. It was selected as winner among over 100 participants.&#10;&#10;Additional description from interview posted at: http://boardgamegeek.com/blogpost/28649/chris-kirkman-on-his-family-of-rabbits&#10;&#10;Diner puts players in the shoes of someone serving patrons at a greasy spoon. The goal is to earn the most in tips by gathering plates of various types from the kitchen and then serving them to a table of patrons in your section demanding certain orders. The real magic of the game is in the pseudo-real time action system.&#10;&#10;When you want to take an action - say, seat a table in your section - you have to have an action token in front of you. When you perform the action you pass the token to the player next to you. Sometimes those action tokens can pile up allowing you to do multiple things at once. Other times you&rsquo;re urging the other players to hurry up a bit so you can serve your tables.&#10;&#10;It&rsquo;s a very madcap, social experience, with lots of table talk. With the action tokens, though, it&rsquo;s not total chaos like many real-time games - there is a lot of control worked into the mechanics. It&rsquo;s a brilliant design, and one that will appeal to many gamers whether they like real-time games or not. Guaranteed.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "This game is all about thinking up clever words that will be hard to decipher and cleverly combining letter pieces to guess secret words.&#10;&#10;Decipher is a different kind of word game for 2&ndash;4 players. Players use four differently-shaped letter pieces to create and solve word puzzles. In each round, a different player builds a secret word puzzle. The others know only which letter pieces are in the secret word and gather clues and points by asking about where letter pieces go. Can you decipher the the secret word?&#10;&#10;The Letter Piece Game system is a special way to build letters from four different basic shapes. The idea for the Letter Piece Game&trade; system comes from the game designers of Wordsmith &mdash; Bill Eberle, Greg Olotka, Peter Olotka, and Jack Kittredge &mdash; whose credits include Cosmic Encounter, Dune, Hoax, and more.&#10;&#10;Decipher includes the same playful semi-transparent colored plastic letter pieces found in Wordsmith. A special plastic insert turns the game box into a game component.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "No Return: Es gibt kein zur&uuml;ck! (&quot;There's No Turning Back!&quot;) is played in two phases, with players collecting tiles in phase one, then scoring their tiles in phase two. People move into phase two at their own pace, and once you go in, you're there for the rest of the game &mdash; which might not be long!&#10;&#10;The game includes 132 tiles, specifically two sets of tiles in six colors, with the tiles being numbered 1-11 in each color. Each player starts with eight tiles in hand, and you can discard and redraw once before the game begins. On a turn, you either (1) discard up to four tiles in your hand from the game, then draw that many tiles from the bag or (2) play one or more tiles from your hand to a color on your board, then draw that many tiles. You can play tiles of only one color, and all the tiles played must be equal to or less than any tiles of that color you already have in play. You place these tiles in descending order, and you can build at most six rows during the game, one of each color.&#10;&#10;Whenever you want, you can switch to phase two. Once you do this, on a turn you either (1) discard up to four tiles in your hand from the game, then draw that many tiles from the bag or (2) clear tiles from your play area to score them. To do this, choose one or more tiles in your play area of only a single color, starting with the lowest valued tile (or tiles), then sum the tiles you want to score. You must then &quot;pay&quot; to score these tiles by discarding tiles of one color from your hand that sum to this same amount or higher. The tiles you discard from your hand don't have to be the same color as the color of the tiles you're scoring. Remove the tiles you paid from the game, and place the tiles you've cleared face down in a score pile. Refill your hand to eight tiles at the end of your turn.&#10;&#10;As soon as someone draws the final tile from the bag, you complete the round so that everyone has had the same number of turns, then the game ends. A player's score equals the sum of the tiles that they've cleared minus the sum of the tiles they still have in play. (Tiles in a player's hand are discarded.) Whoever has the highest score wins!&#10;&#10;",
