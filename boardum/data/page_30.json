    "description": "VivaJava: The Coffee Game: The Dice Game &ndash; or, more simply, VivaJava Dice &ndash; is the successor to the well-received 2012 release of VivaJava: The Coffee Game. As in its predecessor, players of VivaJava Dice take on the roles of employees at the VivaJava CoffeeCo., scouring the globe for the best beans to keep the company on top while keeping themselves one step ahead of the rest of the executives.&#10;&#10;Also as in VivaJava, VivaJava Dice has players making the crucial decision between blending beans and research, but with a quick, new twist. Players must now use the dice in their pool to blend &ndash; using the beans to create a best-seller for quick points, then deciding whether to press their luck in subsequent rounds for bigger points but fewer dice as the blends degrade &ndash; or to research, which involves using their valuable beans to gain an ever-changing variety of dice-manipulating abilities, new ways to score, and paths that lead to aiding a competitor for a later payoff or hindering that competitor for immediate gratification. VivaJava Dice also offers a unique system of cooperative dice-rolling that can help you rise to the top, but at the price of someone else riding your coattails.&#10;&#10;With an astounding mix of plug-and-play research abilities, subtle social play in semi-cooperative mode, and the chance to hog all the glory and blend the best for yourself, VivaJava Dice is all about choice, making each game fast and furiously different.&#10;&#10;",

On your turn, you will be able to perform 1-3 actions depending on how well you have coordinated the workers and your elephant. These actions will consist of collecting resources in the quarry or the market, advancing on the different paths of knowledge, improving your personal board, turning to your mahout (elephant rider) for help and above all making donations to the temple with the aim of obtaining as many prestige points as possible. At the end of the game, the player with the most prestige will be declared the winner of the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Spain, 16th century. You are a powerful ship owner in search of wealth from the recently discovered Mundus Novus (New World). Your goal: Charter fleets of caravels to collect valuable goods (including the legendary Inca relics) and trade to form the best sets to expand your business empire and make your fortune.&#10;&#10;The game is played using two decks of cards: a deck of resource cards, which contains cards representing ten different resources, and a deck of development cards, which give special benefits to their owners. The game is played in rounds, with each round consisting of four phases:&#10;&#10;Each round starts with the Event phase, in which a random event may occur that affects all players.&#10;&#10;The next phase is the Supply phase. Each player receives five random resource cards, plus one resource card for each caravel (a type of development card) that he owns, chosen from a common pool.&#10;&#10;Then, during the Trade phase, the players trade some of their cards. One of the players, the Trade Master, determines how many resource cards (2, 3 or 4) each player must offer for trade. The player that offers the resources with the highest value becomes the new Trade Master. He chooses one of the resources offered by one of the other players, and adds it to his hand, or exchanges it with a card from the market (three face-up cards that are available for such exchanges). Then, the player that he has taken a card from gets to take a card, and so on, until all the cards have been taken.&#10;&#10;Finally, during the Progression phase, the players exchange their resources for doubloons and developments. A player may exchange one set of three or more of the same resource for a development. Bigger combinations and rarer resources will allow more choice of which development can be selected from the five that are on offer. In addition, players can exchange sets of three or more different goods for doubloons, with bigger combinations earning more doubloons.&#10;&#10;If a player can make a combination of ten different cards (i.e., one of each type of resource), he wins the game. Alternatively, if a player has accumulated 75 doubloons, he wins the game. If no player has achieved victory by the time the development deck runs out, the player who has accumulated the most doubloons wins.&#10;&#10;",

Players then take turns placing a card from their tableau in a row on the table; a player can place a card between any two other cards. After placing the card, the player reveals the characteristics on it.

If multiple players go out in the same round, then everyone else is eliminated from play and each of those players are dealt one more card for another round of play. If only one player has no cards after a bonus round, she wins; otherwise play continues until a single player goes out.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "In the Ancient Greece, the poleis (city-states) thrived increasing their population and culture, occasionally waging war against each other, erecting buildings and celebrating ceremonies to get the favour of the deities abiding on Mount Olympus. The players will lead one of these city-states (like Athens, Sparta, Corinth, Thebes, Argos and others) expanding it and worshipping the various gods in order to become the hegemonic power of the Peloponnesus!&#10;&#10;Olympus is a deterministic (i.e., non-random) strategy game, based on worker-placement, resource management and building an efficient engine to score victory points (VPs). It also features a few more aggressive options than the average game based on the same premises (but the savvy player knows how to defend against them, if he prefers to quietly develop his own position).&#10;&#10;Each player leads a city-state that is defined by six values representing population, culture, military and productivity of the three resources (grain, venison and fish). During your turn, you send one of your three priests to worship one of the ten deities (Zeus, Hera, Demetra, Artemis, Poseidon, Athena, Aphrodite, Ares, Hephaestus or Apollo). Each opponent can now send one of his priests to celebrate the ceremony with you. After that, the deity grants his favor to whoever has sent a worshipper: the favor is larger for the leading priest (the one of the active player) and smaller for all the others (for example, Athena boosts culture by two points for the city of leading priest and by one point for the others; of course no boost is given to those who refused to send a priest to worship her). That deity cannot be chosen again in the current turn.&#10;&#10;Since almost all deities are specialized in a certain field, the players must choose which ones they prefer to worship sooner (also guessing which ones may be of interest for the opponents and which ones are safer to skip as they will not be chosen until later) and when it is better to get a smaller benefit following the priest of another player rather than saving a priest to get a greater boon but in a field that may not interest them as much (sort of quality over quantity).&#10;&#10;The resources your city produces (worshipping the correct deities) can be spent (worshipping other deities) to create buildings giving a variety of effects (and VPs), thus offering a lot of different strategic approaches to the game. Victory can be achieved with a plethora of buildings but also with very few ones. There are 45 different buildings: 33 can be built by anyone (even if someone else already did), while the other 12 are unique as only one copy of each can exist (introducing another element of contention between the players). You can also wage war to steal the resources of the other cities (if they were so foolish to keep their warehouses full and their military underdeveloped, it's just what they deserve) or invoke a terrible plague to decimate their population.&#10;&#10;All the actions (development, production, building, war, scoring, etc.) are done by worshipping the proper deity (and some gods give you a choice like &quot;do you develop your grain productivity &ndash; thus receiving more grain the next time you will produce it &ndash; or do you produce it now even if you won't get much?&quot;, adding crucial tactical decisions to the game).&#10;&#10;When all the priests have been used, there's a brief upkeep to check some simple conditions (e.g., players with more than five unused resources must discard those in excess) and then a new turn begins (all priests return home and all deities can be worshipped again).&#10;&#10;Being the first to reach the maximum value in a certain field (e.g. culture 10) gives you an award worth two VPs. When four of these awards are claimed, the game ends. Each player receives bonus points based on how developed his city is and the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "(from Phalanx Games:)&#10;&#10;Revolution: The Dutch Revolt simulates the Eighty Years' War between Spain and the Netherlands. This epic struggle lasted from 1568 until 1648 and eventually brought independence to Holland and the northern provinces. In the south, the revolt was less successful and Belgium did not emerge as an independent state until after the Napoleonic era.&#10;&#10;During the initial stages of the struggle, William of Orange became the symbol of freedom. His main adversary was the Spanish King Philip II, who sent in the Duke of Alba with his formidable conquistadores to stop the rebellion.&#10;&#10;Revolution depicts a power struggle with many facets. Each player represents one of the principal factions involved: the Catholics, Habsburgs, Nobility, Burghers and Reformers. Each faction has its particular goals, which are often partly common. Although factions may sometimes co-operate, they are not allies for long and easily turn on each other if the situation calls for this.&#10;&#10;Historically, there were periods of open warfare and others of uneasy peace. The reforming factions gradually became more established, particularly in the north and along the coast. The once supreme Habsburg armies were slowly driven out of these areas through a series of siege battles. The defeat of the mighty Armada by a combined Dutch/English fleet in 1588 cost the Spaniards dearly. The Catholics were eventually allowed to retain some of their influence, while the local Nobility, initially catholic but with local sympathies, succeeded or failed according to their willingness to accept the changed circumstances.&#10;&#10;This game is not a detailed military re-enactment of the Eighty Years' War. It tries to capture the flavor of these interesting times in a much broader sense. It contains an element of warfare in the form of battles and sieges but the main theme is built on economic, religious and political control. The constantly shifting balance of power, caused by temporary alliances, makes Revolution an immensely challenging game, and not for the faint-hearted. Clever and timely use of available resources, including those of foreign sympathizers and allies, is needed to achieve ultimate success.&#10;&#10;Revolution: The Dutch Revolt was more than 15 years in the making, and marks Francis Tresham's long-awaited return to the forefront of game design. He is most famous for his widely acclaimed board games Civilization and 1829.&#10;&#10;Revolution: The Dutch Revolt includes 1 large gameboard, 41 playing cards, 416 colorful game pieces (56 resource pieces in each of 5 colors, 8 army pieces in each of 5 colors, 47 neutral pieces, 3 water beggars, 1 VP marker for each color, 1 game turn marker and 40 status markers), 1 player aid card and 1 rules booklet.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "This is a collectible trading card game published by Upper Deck in 2006 (Cryptozoic Entertainment took over the license and game in 2010) based on the massively multi-player online roleplaying game &quot;World of Warcraft.&quot;&#10;&#10;The World of Warcraft Trading Card Game draws from the rich lore of the Warcraft universe. Two factions are battling for supremacy over Azeroth&mdash;the Horde and the Alliance&mdash;and each time you play, you choose a hero from one of these factions to represent you. Your hero is the leader of your party who fights alongside your allies. The cards that you play will allow you to equip your hero with weapons and armor, use spells and talents, invite allies into your party, and complete quests. With each successive TCG set, the theme and cards echo the current max-level content from the online game.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to defeat your opponents before they defeat you. Over the course of the game, your hero and allies will deal damage to your opponents&rsquo; heroes and allies, and that damage is permanent unless it is healed. If your hero takes damage equal to or greater than his or her health, you&rsquo;re out of the game.&#10;&#10;Sets released&#10;&#10;Heroes of Azeroth (released October 2006) &#10;Through the Dark Portal (released April 2007) &#10;Fires of Outland (released August 2007) &#10;March of The Legion (released December 2007) &#10;Servants of the Betrayer (released April 2008) &#10;The Hunt for Illidan (released July 2008) &#10;Drums of War (released November 2008) &#10;Blood of Gladiators (released March 2009) &#10;Fields of Honor (released June 2009) &#10;Scourgewar (released November 2009) &#10;Wrathgate (released May 2010) &#10;Class Starter deck (July 2010)&#10;Archives (released August 2010)&#10;Icecrown (released September 2010)&#10;Worldbreaker (released December 2010)&#10;War of the Elements (released April 2011)&#10;Twilight of the Dragons (released July 2011)&#10;Throne of the Tides (released October 2011)&#10;Crown of the Heavens (released February 2012)&#10;Tomb of the Forgotten (released June 2012)&#10;War of the Ancients (released October 2012)&#10;Betrayal of the Guardian (released February 2013)&#10;Reign of Fire (released July 2013)&#10; Raid Decks&#10;&#10;Onyxia's Lair (December 2006) - Featuring the black dragon Onyxia.

    "description": "Deal with the Devil is a deeply thematic competitive Eurogame set in a fantasy medieval era. Each of the four players takes on a secret role of a mortal, a cultist, or even the Devil. Due to the asymmetrical roles, players experience the same game but with different game goals every play.&#10;&#10;During the blind trading phase, players can offer their resources in exchange for money from another player. The Devil will tempt mortals with goods for a piece of their soul, while the cultist's nature is to sell their soul easily. Only the accompanying app knows who is trading with whom.&#10;&#10;But beware! Showing off how well you are doing can attract unwelcome attention and the suspicion of other players. It also may pique the interest of the Inquisition, which is eager to punish those who cannot prove their souls remain intact.&#10;&#10;There are many dynamic strategies to experiment with across each playing. Will you sell pieces of your soul early on to boost your city-building prowess at the risk of future punishment from the Inquisition? Or will you carefully manage loan and debt repayment while waiting for others to inadvertently reveal their nefarious nature? Every choice has a consequence, and each role has its own unique strategic approach to explore.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

In this States of Siege&trade; solitaire game of horror and survival, your strategies will be put to the test. The world has gone crazy &ndash; a deadly virus has turned ordinary people into vicious, zombie-like killers. The undead, nicknamed &quot;Zeds,&quot; are now converging on your corner of the world.

Regular citizens may emerge as heroes as you work to halt the Zeds' advances by (re)killing them, discovering and implementing a cure to this vile scourge, and preserving the area and its inhabitants as much as possible.

A delivery of goods directly from the delivery truck into the market stall is not allowed; at least one path space must lie between them. Unfortunately the competition between the traders is quite intense, so you will block each other from the shortest paths with your market stalls. Neutral flea market tables will get in the way, too.&#10;&#10;To secure the prime spaces for your market stalls, you must buy the stall tiles cheaply at an auction &mdash; but if you bid too little and lose the auctions you may later get a space much further away.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game you add all the paths between your market stalls and the delivery trucks, then subtract the saved coins from this sum.

These areas are represented by tracks that you will mark off as you make progress. Many of the tracks are interconnected with other elements in the game, giving you bonuses along the way and opportunities to unlock more points. Advancing on all of these tracks offers various amounts of points, advancements, and bonuses.&#10;&#10;The game lasts eight rounds. Each round, roll colored dice based on the number of players, then place them on spaces on the blueprint table based on value and color. Each player drafts one die and uses it. Once everyone has drafted a die twice, all players get to use the remaining die on the blueprint table.&#10;&#10;After eight rounds, you score points for your progress in engineering, assembly, testing, and more. Whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;Motor City has a solo mode in which you try to top your own score against an auditor that drafts dice and blocks areas of your sheet. Its difficulty can easily be adjusted by changing the colors of dice during setup, with no added rules.&#10;&#10;Motor City is game 3 of the Motor City Gameworks Loaded Roll and Write series.&#10;&#10;Game 1: Fleet: The Dice Game&#10;Game 2: Three Sisters&#10;Game 3: Motor City&#10;&#10;&ndash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "From the Hanging Gardens of Babylon to the Pyramids of Egypt, and without forgetting the Greek Parthenon, The Builders: Antiquity &mdash; a standalone card game based on The Builders: Middle Ages &mdash; offers a whole range of challenges to its builders. To face these challenges, you must put on your foreman clothes. Between hiring workers, managing their organization, purchasing slaves or tools, and taking out loans, you'll have to make the right decisions to fulfill your dream: Becoming the greatest builder the age has ever known.&#10;&#10;In the game, players score points (and gain money) by completing the construction of buildings. Each building has four characteristics &mdash; carpentry, masonry, architecture, painting &mdash; rated between 0 and 5, and the workers have the same characteristics valued in the same range. To complete a construction, the player must add enough workers to cover the four characteristics of the building, but placing a worker on a construction site costs money.&#10;&#10;Each turn players have three free actions; however, for an added cost players may also chose to buy additional actions during their turn. Unlike in The Builders: Middle Ages, players can acquire slaves and put them to work, but if they don't pay to free the slaves by the end of the game, they lose points. Other changes from the original game include the ability to send your workers to universities or purchase tools to improve their characteristics.&#10;&#10;Make use of your workers, of your slaves, or your freed slaves to build your buildings and amass victory points to ultimately be named the greatest builder of all!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "&quot;Fill Yore Hand ...&quot; with Gunslinger, the game of western gunfights. In Gunslinger, you play the part of a western character who is caught in a sudden gunfight, and you face the split-second decisions and incidents of the showdown as bullets start to fly.&#10;&#10;Gunslinger is based on a quick and easy game system that recreates the split-second nature of gunplay. Each turn the players secretly play cards to define exactly what they will do during the next two seconds in the game. Then they step through these actions on the playing map, resolving each shot in the split-second when it takes place. Gunslinger resolves combat quickly and easily. The attacker draws a result card that shows exactly where the shot hits, which combines with his/her weapon to determine the damage inflicted. This recreates the critical differences between weapons: Winchesters, Shotguns, Buffalo rifles, Colt's &quot;Peacemaker&quot;, Smith &amp; Wesson's breakopen guns and Remington's Derringer are a few of the guns in the game.&#10;&#10;Gunslinger includes eight two-sided boards (a total of sixteen map faces) portraying town and countryside terrain at a scale of six feet per hex. These boards can be assembled in varying ways to create a vast number of different maps that are used in the gunfights. The terrain includes gullies, hills, trees, watering troughs, wells, hitching posts and the interiors of buildings.&#10;&#10;Gunslinger presents 26 different gunfights and several hundred variations, including both historical gunfights and made-up situations. Wild Bill Hickok, Billy the Kid, Wyatt Earp, and John Wesley Hardin are just a few of the real gunslingers of history who appear in re-creations of the gunfights that made them famous.  Indian raids, barroom brawls and poker games are just a few of the hypothetical situations.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Component List(From box back, augmented with detail from Wayne's Books page)&#10;&#10;&#10;     Rules&#10;     8x two-sided mapboards&#10;     Result card deck (108)&#10;     Pad of personal history sheets&#10;     Countersheet&#10;         60 round (people)&#10;         112 medium square (objects)&#10;         96 small square (tactical)&#10;         9 large (horses)&#10;    &#10;     Action Cards (130)&#10;         7x standard sets of 12 each&#10;         4x B1&#10;         7x B2&#10;         7x B3&#10;         5x B4&#10;         5x B5&#10;         5x B6&#10;         5x B7&#10;         4x B8&#10;         4x B9&#10;    &#10;     &quot;Second Floor&quot; player-aid cards x4&#10;&#10;&#10;",

To throw a proper monster mash, you only need one thing&mdash;Spook Juice&mdash;and you&rsquo;re gonna need an awful lot of it for these party animals. Spook Juice is a powerful spirit distilled from human fear, and the main ingredient in every popular monster drink. The bad news is that you&rsquo;re completely out of it. The good news is that the nearby town, Startleton, is a great place to scare some up.&#10;&#10;You need to send your Monster disciples to scare up some of that sweet Spook Juice. So dust off your Fearmobiles and get your scariest Monsters on Board!&#10;&#10;Monsters on Board is a dice-drafting game that takes place over six rounds. Each round, players will draft Monster Lords (dice) arriving from out of town in Fearmobiles, trying to fulfill their Prophecy cards.&#10;&#10;After each player drafts four Monsters, they will send them to the Order of Spider Jack. Monsters sent here will give players actions, as well as Spook Juice when Spider Jack is summoned. The higher the die&rsquo;s number, the scarier the Monster, which means the more Spook Juice they will scare up for you. However, scarier Monsters have fewer and less powerful actions, while less frightening Monsters have more powerful actions (they try harder)&mdash; so choose wisely!&#10;&#10;Drafted Monsters also move their matching colored Grunt (Monster miniature) through the Town of Startleton, scaring the townspeople with the help of their little Minions (miniatures). In doing so, Grunts will award players bonus actions. If the Grunts terrorize the town well enough, they will grant bonus Spook Juice during final scoring.&#10;&#10;Additionally, players will draft Arch Monsters and Ghosts that will help them achieve their goals.&#10;&#10;During final scoring, players will gain additional Spook Juice based on how well they completed their Prophecy cards, scared the Town, and appeased the Arch Monsters. The player with the most Spook Juice wins!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Unhappy King Charles! allows two players to decide whether Commons or Cavalier shall rule in England. Both seek to establish control over the country and of its economic structures. They seek not only to defeat their opponents in battle but also to seize control of the local government of England and Wales.&#10;&#10;The game is based on We the People, Mark Herman's ingenious game on a later rebellion. As the organization of armies and states was often desultory, the cards do not provide a wide range of choices (as in Paths of Glory). The players in Unhappy King Charles! must make do with what they have. The three decks of cards - Early(1642-1643), Middle(1644) and Late (1645)- have been developed to give the correct feel for the early, middle and late war, based on storyboarding techniques. As befits a Civil War, there is treachery, bravery and stupidity in the events on the cards.&#10;&#10;Unhappy King Charles! is played over eleven turns, each representing about four months. Brigades of troops are used to form Armies (defined Rule 3) or garrisons of fortresses (Rule 13). Only unled Brigades are on the map; the others are placed on the box of their General on the Command Displays. Generals move on the maps.&#10;&#10;The Armies of Unhappy King Charles! are temporary massings of troops that have as much to do with feudal armies as modern revolutionaries. With inadequate supply and poor equipment it is not surprising that these armies suffer from continual desertion; and in using them you are going to have to ensure they wander the map collecting fresh recruits. Armies can be over 30,000 for a vital siege or battle or 3,000 tough cavalry under Prince Rupert or Black Tom Fairfax.&#10;&#10;Movement activations are initiated via a numbered Ops Card, as in We the People, and are based on Army size. The smaller the Army the faster it can move. Movement across the map is by means of Areas joined by movement lines. Control of areas can change during movement if movement points are spent. Non-moving Armies can attempt interception, placing themselves in the path of the moving Army to cause Battle.&#10;&#10;The game's basic combat unit is the Brigade, which comes in two types: Veterans (value 2) and militia (value 1). Usually militia units must be recruited before veterans of that Region. Each Region's Areas and Brigades use the same basic colour system. Fresh Brigades are received by Recruitment, which is usually limited to the unit's region of origin. Brigades lost in combat are not available for recruitment (though some Event Cards can bring them back); other losses are available.&#10;&#10;Leader counters are either Generals (with a Strategic and Battle Rating) or Local Notables (Governors of fortresses). Generals can be Field Generals (who operate everywhere) or Regional Generals who can suffer disadvantages when outside their Region. Generals cannot transfer Brigades to other Generals (unless Event Cards require), Brigades remain with their original General until death, dispersal or desertion takes them. Local Notables can transfer Brigades to other friendly Generals.&#10;&#10;Battles use the Combat Value of Brigades, General's Battle Ratings and Combat Cards to resolve combat. But before any Battle is fought one side can try to Evade (leave the Area) or Disperse (remove itself before combat). Losses in combat are not available for recruitment. Drawn and Decisive Victories will kill Veteran Brigades (if there are any) first. The loser must retreat and can suffer further losses if he retreats through enemy PC Markers. Major and Decisive Victories earn extra Cards.&#10;&#10;Fortresses cover a wide range of locations. They are ranked by class and must be forced to Surrender by Siege or Event Card. Siege requires the attention of an Army for some time (most Fortresses will require more than one activation to capture). If attacked during that time the besieger can have to abandon the Siege. Assaults can be attempted (at a cost in losses).&#10;&#10;The game can be won by an Automatic Victory, by one side failing to control enough Areas, or at the end of the eleventh turn.&#10;&#10;For those players who like some counter-factuals a pack of would-be events is provided. Now players can use Dutch squadrons to blockade the King, summon the Duke of Lorraine, or cause a rising in London. As an Optional Rule, four events are drawn each game and shuffled into the middle and late decks.&#10;&#10;Cover artwork inspired by Sir Anthony van Dyck (1599-1641)&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Inhabit the Earth is a race game played on six continent boards. Players create their own menagerie of up to six creatures, each of which is represented by up to six cards, by using cards to introduce, multiply, evolve, and adapt their creatures. Each of the 162 unique cards identifies a creature's class, a continent and terrain that the creature inhabits, and a special or scoring ability.&#10;&#10;Each class of creature is also represented by a counter, and the cards are also used to trigger the movement of the counters along the trails on the boards and by migrating, from one board to another. Breeding, achieved by flipping over a creature's counter, generates new cards. Movement facilitates further breeding and the chance to secure tokens for additional icons and point scoring.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, points are scored through abilities on the creature's cards, the position of the creatures' counters on the boards, and from tokens; the player with the most points wins. Rules for an introductory game for up to three players are included.&#10;&#10;",

The game also includes twenty contract tiles.&#10;&#10;The game is played over seven rounds. At the start of a round, the dealer randomly draws one special card, reads it to all the players, shuffles it into the deck, then deals the deck out evenly to all players. (The dealer for the first round is the game's owner; for subsequent rounds, the dealer is the one who took the 5 of Dwarves in the previous round.) The player who receives the 5 of Knights draws a contract tile, reads it, then chooses one of the two scoring rules on it to apply for that round.&#10;&#10;The player holding the 5 of Goblins leads on the first trick. Players must follow suit if possible, and the game includes no trump. The highest card played of the suit led wins the trick and leads to the next trick. Once all cards have been played, players tally their points (possibly negative), remove the special card and contract tile from the game, then shuffle for the next round.&#10;&#10;The player who scores the most points over seven rounds wins the game.&#10;&#10;Roots to Barbu&#10;&#10;",

At the start of the game, each player draws three animal tiles, chooses one of these tiles, and places it on a bracket of his ark without showing it to the other players.&#10;&#10;The leftover animals that players initially drew begin forming what will become a single animal collective in the center of the table. The total number of animals in the collective is based on the number of players, but one animal in the collective will always be face-down. Each player also starts with one food crate and may never have more than five food crates at any time.&#10;&#10;On each turn, a player has two options: (a) split a collective of animals into two groups and take a food crate, or (b) take one of the animal collectives into their ark by paying a food crate for each animal in that group. As players choose their group of animals, they drop out of the turn. The first player to drop out of a turn starts the next turn. The game ends when an ark has at least ten animals on board.&#10;&#10;Before scoring, all animals in pairs are discarded because a guy called Noah claims all animal pairs for himself. Single animals score the points imprinted on the tile (from 1-5) and herds of animals automatically score five points each. Remaining food crates also score one point each.&#10;&#10;",

In addition, the tiles in Limes have a different layout from those in Cities. Together, these changes ensure that Limes has become an entirely new game. (Limes includes two sets of cards, one for each player, but if you combine copies of the game, any number of people can play at the same time.)&#10;&#10;Each player has his own deck of cards. One player shuffles his deck, then places a card at random on the table; each other player takes this same card and places it on the table in his own area. Each player can optionally place one of his figures on this card; once a figure is placed on a card, it cannot be returned to the supply. The second card played (and all subsequent cards) much be placed adjacent to or touching the corner of an already-played card. After each card placement, a player can either place a new figure on this card or move an already-placed figure; a figure can move from one territory to an adjacent territory, e.g., from woods to lake or from grain fields to woods.&#10;&#10;The game ends as soon as any player has placed 16 cards in a square (4x4 grid). Each player then receives points as follows:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Farmers receive one point for each connected grain field.&#10;    Fishermen receive one point for every house situated directly adjacent to their lake.&#10;    Watchmen receive one point for every patch of woods they can see in a straight line (north, east, south, west) from their tower; other watchtowers block their view, so they can't see woods behind those towers.&#10;    Woodcutters receive one point for every territory to which they can deliver wood, e.g., every different adjacent territory.&#10;&#10;&#10;The player with the most points wins, with ties being broken in favor of the player who has the highest score with a single figure.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Last Train to Wensleydale is a railway themed game set in the Yorkshire Dales. The aim of the game is to move stone, cheese, and passengers from the Dales to the major trunk routes served by the North Eastern Railway and the Midland Railway.&#10;&#10;Valleys play a large part in dictating where you can build track. Once you have built a line you must acquire second hand engines and rolling stock to move the goods and passengers that your line connects to. Such a line quickly becomes unprofitable and it pays to have one of the two major companies take it over from you.&#10;&#10;Building track can also be made more difficult by local residents who object to railways being built on their land. To overcome such opposition you require influence in government to arrange the necessary compulsory purchase orders.&#10;&#10;Description of the game, from the backside of the box:&#10;For many years the train gaming world has been waiting for a game about moving cheese in the Yorkshire Dales. That wait is now over!&#10;As the director of a small railway company who has inveigled investment money from gullible locals, it's up to you to see if you can actually make a profit from building track amongst some of the most difficult terrain in England. There's stone to be moved from quarries, and cheese to be moved to market. You might also find the odd passenger who wants to travel to civilization.&#10;&#10;However, standing in your way is the local farmer, who really does not want you to build on his land. Fortunately you can buy favours from the necessary government committee to deal with such irritations. You will also need a few contacts with other train companies, as you will need their second-hand engines to run on your lines. Finally, once you've sucked all the profit that you can from a route, you must off-load it to a major train company before you are saddled with the losses.&#10;&#10;",

However, his tedious neighbours tend to interfere when he is away, and frequently drop by to help themselves to the garden produce. Can Mr. Cabbagehead create a beautiful garden and finally win the blue ribbon?&#10;&#10;In Mr. Cabbagehead's Garden, vegetable cards are drafted and placed in the garden plot, a grid of six cards by three cards. Depending on which cards are selected, one of the tedious neighbours may interfere with the garden in a variety of ways. Players must be careful in their choice of vegetable to plant, in its position in the garden, and in maintaining their supply of invaluable bees, which give Mr. Cabbagehead more flexibility in planting.&#10;&#10;Once all cards have been drawn, the game is over and the Garden Club committee visits to evaluate Mr. Cabbagehead's garden. The number and position of vegetables matter, and players must be creative in developing a garden that is both pleasing to the eye and plentiful in vegetables.&#10;&#10;Originally released in 2016 in a print-and-play version with four neighbours, the 2018 published deluxe edition of Mr. Cabbagehead's Garden adds more neighbours, more variety in scoring, and a streamlined set of rules that includes a fixed garden plot grid variant. More importantly, the published version includes rules for two players.&#10;&#10;",

The other plays as the forest and its creatures who defend their home with the aid of &quot;leaf lore&quot; and forest spirits.&#10;&#10;To obtain the power needed to oppose your enemy, you must send seekers to compete for the lore controlled by elementals, ancient beings who bestow the lore on those who seek it. Seekers also engage in combat for control of shrines on the board, scoring you bonus points if you occupy a majority of shrines surrounding forest havens. When one type of lore is depleted or one elemental has left the board, the Haven Guardian awakens and the player with the higher score masters the forest &mdash; or defends it from harm &mdash; and wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

Five clans of goblins are represented on the game cards, with goblins in one of three ranks. To build an army, a player must first recruit level I goblins, then build on those goblins with level II and finally level III. Those higher level goblins can be played only if a lower level goblin is of the same clan, and since goblins of the same clan have similar abilities or powers that mesh well, players tend to specialize in who they recruit to their ranks.&#10;&#10;Each turn, a player can play a new goblin, activate a goblin, draw cards, or pass. To activate a goblin or draw cards, players need to spend 1-2 activation tokens, with them having only two at the start of each battle. Many goblins have special powers that come into play when they're recruited, attacked, removed from play, placed with other goblins, and so on.&#10;&#10;Once all players have passed, the player with the most powerful army wins the battle. Players keep cards in hand from one battle to the next, so laying out all your forces at once can leave you with little to do but get hit in later battles. The first player to win three battles wins the game.&#10;&#10;Reimplemented as:&#10;&#10;    GOSU 2: Tactics&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Each tile will have a mixture of any or all of five types of terrain: grasslands, farmlands, mountains, woods, and hills. Each player gets a Player Aid card, selects a color of people tokens and places the era cube of the matching color on The Era Starting Box on the Progress Column part of the game board. A starting player is selected. Some tiles are placed contiguously on the game board (the number of tiles depends on the number of players) one at a time in turn order.

The game is now ready to begin.&#10;&#10;Game play:&#10;&#10;Players should note which terrain will be worth Progress Points at the end of the era. Progress Points are the number of hexes occupied of the scoring terrain by one&rsquo;s token plus the number of city tiles plus the value of all eligible Idea Cards. The player or players with the most Progress Points will advance to the new era and get an advantage over the other players.&#10;&#10;In turn, a player may:&#10;-    Move people&#10;-    Have babies (increase the number of people tokens on the game board)&#10;-    Have a fight (initiate the diceless combat system against another player)&#10;-    Have an idea (draw chance cards)&#10;-    Build a city (replace people tokens with a city tile)&#10;&#10;After all the players have used all of their turns the era has ended.

Progress Points are then compared and the leader(s) advance to take advantage of one&rsquo;s newest ability.&#10;&#10;The game is over after ten eras. Victory Points are the total of number of non-mountain hexagons occupied by one&rsquo;s tokens plus the values of one&rsquo;s cities plus three points for advancing to the final era.

Being a classic 18xx game, the players compete to become the richest. In order to gain money, they buy and sell shares of China's historical railway companies, build and expand their railway network, and let trains travel on the networks. Shares of successful companies are worth more, and owning them will increase the chance to win the game. In the end, the player with the highest wealth combined from cash and shares wins.&#10;&#10;1880: China innovates on the 18xx model as follows:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Turn order for companies doesn't change with the evolving stock prices; it is set along with the par price when a player opens a company.&#10;    The game includes a player-manipulated ratio of stock rounds and operation rounds. For example, a new stock round occurs when the last of a type of train is bought.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Each character in Funkoverse is unique, so players are encouraged to try out different combinations of characters and items in order to discover their favorite synergies and powerful strategies for all four game scenarios.&#10;&#10;As of launch, the Funkoverse Strategy Game consists of four-character sets and two-character sets. Every four-character and two-character set is playable as a standalone game and comes with exclusive Funko Pop!

Using the investigation speed indicated on the card each player has in hand, players take turns guessing which player (whether yourself or someone else) holds the &quot;Lost Legacy&quot; card; this card might also be in the &quot;Ruins&quot;, a location that holds one card at the start of the game and possibly acquires more cards during play. The player who guesses correctly wins; if no one finds the Lost Legacy, then everybody loses.&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;By combining different Lost Legacy sets (while keeping only a single Lost Legacy card in play), up to six players can compete at the same time.&#10;&#10;This is the English release of the 16 cards Flying Garden set in Lost Legacy with new artwork.

During stock rounds, shares in the various railroading companies are bought &amp; sold by players and are tracked on the stock market mat. During operating rounds, the player/directors of those railroading companies are allowed to build track &amp; place station markers on the map, and then may buy trains from which to earn capital from running those trains along routes on the map. The capital earned may be paid out as dividends to shareholders or retained by the company for future expansion.&#10;&#10;The game ends at a pre-determined point, whereupon the player with the most worth,(cash on hand &amp; share certificate value) wins.&#10;&#10;As with many games in this series, there are similarities within the rules, but many feature slight differences, and it is these that give each individual 18xx game its character.&#10;&#10;1848 features an interesting array of differences described above. These include how private companies are purchased, the inclusion of The Bank Of England as a public company that extends loans and administers railroads that are in receivership, dealing with different track gauges between states and 'The Ghan' special train.&#10;&#10;",

Alternatively, you can prevent your rival from placing a token in the Imperial garden, showing that you have more control than your opponent.&#10;&#10;To set up the game, shuffle the 16 tiles and arrange them in a 4x4 square; each tile shows one of four types of vegetation (maple, cherry, pine or iris) and one of four types of poetic symbols (rising sun, bird, rain or tanzaku - the small pieces of paper on which people sometimes write wishes).&#10;&#10;The starting player removes one tile on the border of the square, sets this tile aside, then places one of her tokens in this space. The opponent must then do the same thing, but can choose from only those tiles that depict the same type of vegetation or poetic symbol shown on the tile first set aside. Play continues, with each set-aside tile determining where the next player can go until:&#10;&#10;&#10;    A player forms a line with four of her tokens in any direction,&#10;    A player forms a 2x2 square with four of her tokens, or&#10;    A player chooses a tile which doesn't allow her opponent to place a token.&#10;&#10;&#10;In any of these cases, the player has won the game. A match can be a single game, a &quot;best of three&quot; series, or a point-based match, with the winner of a game earning as many points as the number of tiles remaining in the grid when she wins; in this case, the player who first collects ten points wins the match.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Rook is a trump-based trick-taking game played with a deck of Rook playing cards. It was first sold in 1906 by Parker Brothers.  The Rook deck is similar to a standard deck of cards, but has only numbers from 1-14 in four colors (no face cards or card suits (spades, etc.)).&#10;&#10;The standard game is a 4-player partnership game with the 1's, 2's, 3's, and 4's removed for a deck of 41 cards (with the Rook card).  Each hand, players bid for Trump, and then the partnership that won the bid must make the amount of points bid in the hand.  Play of each trick is similar to Whist games like Bridge. The card led must be followed by a card of the same color.  A player may play a trump color if they have none of the color led.  The highest card of the color led wins the trick, unless the trick is trumped, and then the highest trump wins the trick.  The Rook card can be played at any time, and always wins the trick.  Unlike Whist or Bridge, the amount of tricks is not important, but certain count cards (5's, 10's, 14's, and the Rook card) taken in tricks are worth points, which is how the game is scored.&#10;&#10;The standard game is 4-player, but there are variants for 2-player and 3-player in the rules, and there also are many variations and house rules used in play.&#10;&#10;Rook has also been referred to as Missionary Poker.  The Rook deck, with no-face cards or suits from a standard deck of cards, has often been a card game played by religious groups who object to using a standard deck of cards.&#10;&#10;",

Players hold a hand of cards that correspond to numbered plots on each bank, and they place knights in open plots for which they hold the corresponding cards.  After establishing duchies, players attempt to expand them to include more plots of land, as well as buildings - such as castles, cathedrals, and cities. These buildings both add to the value of a duchy and provide their owners with advantages during game play.  Combined with a uniquely Knizia-style scoring system, this game has some very interesting dynamics.&#10;&#10;",

That said, the game differs in a number of ways from Mr. Jack. In more detail...&#10;&#10;In Le Fant&ocirc;me de l&rsquo;Op&eacute;ra, eight suspect tokens stand in the ten rooms of the Op&eacute;ra Garnier. Each suspect has a reason to drive the opera singer La Carlotta away from the production, and at the start of the game one of the suspects is randomly determined to be the true identity of the Phantom player. The other player is the Investigator, and he wants to discover the Phantom's identity; if he does so before La Carlotta flees the Op&eacute;ra Garnier, then he wins. Otherwise, he loses. (To balance play between newcomers and experienced players La Carlotta's starting position can changed.)&#10;&#10;At the start of each odd round, eight suspect cards are shuffled and four of them revealed. The Investigator moves one suspect and (likely) uses this suspect's unique ability, then the Phantom moves two of the remaining three suspects, then the Investigator moves the final suspect. The Phantom player then reveals whether he can or cannot cause a disturbance in the Op&eacute;ra Garnier, thus scaring La Carlotta; he can cause a disturbance only if he's alone or if he's in the room with the blackout token. If he can cause a disturbance, the Investigator clears all suspects sharing a lit room; if not, the Investigator clears all suspects in the dark or on their own. After this, La Carlotta moves one step closer to fleeing for each suspect that hasn't been declared innocent (and an additional step if the Phantom did create a disturbance).&#10;&#10;For each even round, the remaining four suspect cards are revealed, and the players again move characters and use their special abilities, with the Phantom going first. The game continues until only a single suspect is not innocent or La Carlotta flees France for the safety of Milan.&#10;&#10;When a character moves, it can move up to as many spaces as the number of characters in the room from which it moves. Most characters can move only through open corridors, but Meg Giry can use secret passageways that connect many of the rooms. The players must use Meg's ability and the other characters' special abilities to hide or reveal information. One character, for example, moves a padlock that blocks one corridor, while another is responsible for the roaming blackout that allows the Phantom to operate in darkness (or at least provide cover for his activity elsewhere). One sweet character can draw everyone from adjacent rooms to her side, while an unpleasant fellow can drive everyone away. Still another reveals (or hides) an alibi card, clearing one suspect (or keeping his true nature unknown). Every character is useful in the right situation. You just have to learn what those situations are...&#10;&#10;",

The result is a skill-based dueling card game that feels utterly different from all the other card games you have played before.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "The Walking Dead: All Out War is a tactical head-to-head game set in the walker-strewn Georgia countryside, a survival miniatures game from Mantic Games based on the characters from the pages of the bestselling The Walking Dead comic series. Your group will be pitted against other groups in a bitter fight for supplies, but the Walkers react to your every move. In this game, everyone and everything is trying to kill you.&#10;&#10;In more detail, each player controls their own group of survivors made up of popular characters from The Walking Dead storyline, such as Rick, Shane, Michonne and many more. Each survivor is represented by a finely-detailed plastic miniature, which can be painted in your color scheme of choice. It comes with a character card highlighting their game stats and unique abilities, and it can be upgraded with a selection of weapon and equipment cards.&#10;&#10;The game is set around Atlanta and the surrounding suburbs, and contains a gaming mat and a selection of barricades, abandoned cars and supplies to give it that authentic The Walking Dead atmosphere. Your survivors move across the board using the measuring stick included with the game, and you use the terrain to block Walker routes, sneak up on opposing survivors, or raid enemy camps for supplies.&#10;&#10;During the game, you fight a bitter battle for resources against a rival group of survivors &ndash; but be careful not to make too much noise as you'll draw the attention of the Walkers, which are controlled by an AI system developed specifically for this game. They attack anyone who comes within reach &mdash; and because they are AI-controlled, you can play the game solo.&#10;&#10;The base game includes rules for running simple campaigns and basic guidelines for designing your own characters.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "The day dawns like any other.  The sun makes its way low over the misty horizon and stays low in the Autumn sky this morning.  All is as it has always been in the fields and meadows of the Steppes.  Commander Garrison Dietrich raises himself through the cupola of the Tiger he commands and begins to scan the landscape.  He looks left to right, right to left searching the fields for his target.  He breathes in deeply.  The scent of metal and leather, sweat and stale cigarettes, rises from inside the musty tank.  He studies the landscape and he listens. With heart pounding and senses alert he is poised&hellip;. anticipating.  For Commander Dietrich, tank to tank warfare is more than a duel.  Beyond the field-rocket artillery, the bombers and U-Boats, the single-seat fighters, beyond the 88mm Flak, is the Tiger. His Tiger and platoon,  only the T-34s of the Red Army standing between them and victory!&#10;&#10;Suddenly, to his right, geese startle from the tall, drying grass of the field.  They fly fast and out of view quickly.  Commander Dietrich turns his gaze sharply to the right and there, indistinctly outlined, silent, foreboding...his eyes make contact with it - a Russian T34.&#10;&#10;Inside the tank, his team is alert and ready.  In the confined space of the tank they are in position. Through the radio they hear the call, &quot;I spot 'em at 1600, 1600!!&quot;  Through the narrow rectangular window the driver attempts to locate the T34.  An AP shell is loaded into the breech. The gunner yells, &quot;Ready to fire!&quot;  His heart, too, is pounding.  Loud sounds now, the gears, the clacking of Bogey wheels over terrain, the vibration of the motor...then, &quot;Hull down, hull down,&quot; is called out to the driver.  The Commander orders, &quot;Traverse, traverse...TRAVERSE!&quot;  The turret moves slowly, the sounds of machinery moving but slow, too slow!  The alert gunner feels the rush.  &quot;I've got 'em in my sights, 1400...1200! Do you see him, do you see him?&quot; The panic, the fear, the adrenaline are palpable.  &quot;I've got 'em sir, I've got 'em!!&quot;  The anticipated command comes as the tanks advance...&quot;FIRE!&quot;  The gunner aims, pulls the lever, and its SHELL AWAY&hellip;.&#10;&#10;Tank Duel: Enemy in the Crosshairs is a card-based game for 1 to 8 players that depicts tank-to-tank warfare on the Eastern Front of World War II in the early to mid 1940s. It attempts to convey the claustrophobia and urgency that tank crews experienced in this bitter conflict, utilizing a simple action system to keep the action moving at a rapid pace. Players will issue commands with the use of battle cards and attempt to score victory points by claiming objectives and eliminating their opponent's tanks and crew.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Time to travel once again to distant locations, but in Lost Cities: Rivals you might find yourself running short of cash to take the trips you want!&#10;&#10;Lost Cities: Rivals features gameplay familiar from other titles in the Lost Cities series. Players will collect colored expedition cards and place them in ascending order in personal expeditions, possibly placing wager cards before beginning an expedition in order to increase its value. The primary difference in this title compared to others is that you must win auctions in order to place cards in your expeditions.&#10;&#10;The card deck consists of (in each of the five colors) three wager cards, two copies of cards numbered 2-5, and one copy of cards numbered 6-10; shuffle this deck, then divide it into four piles, keeping only one pile in front of players for now. From a separate deck, each player is given two differently colored wager cards at the start of play. A bank of 36 coins is divided equally among the players.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you can either reveal the top card from the current pile (adding it to the display) or auction the cards on display. In the auction, you must raise or pass, and once only a single person remains in the auction, they pay the amount bid to the center of the table, then take any cards that they want to play and start or add to expeditions. Placing the same number in an expedition is okay. The auction winner can also place one card from the display in the box out of play. The auction winner ends their turn by adding a card to the display.&#10;&#10;When the final card of a pile is revealed, divide all the coins in the center of the table equally among all players, then bring in a new pile to continue play. Once the final card of the final pile is revealed, the game ends immediately with no distribution of coins. For each expedition, a player scores the number of footprints on the numbered cards. If they have a wager in that color, they double that value; if two wagers, they triple it; etc. A player also scores 1 point for each gold coin they hold and 8 points for each expedition that contains at least four number cards. Whoever has the highest total wins!&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Stratego by Jumbo is the most well-known of this type of hidden tactics board games. It was launched just after World War II in 1946 and has led to a variety of various themed versions and spinoff variations.&#10;&#10;This game is very similar to, and almost certainly derived directly from, the Gibsons game L'Attaque who had acquired the UK rights in 1925 from the game&rsquo;s creator Mademoiselle Hermance Edan who launched it in France in 1909. It is not exactly the same, but not far from it (numbered pieces, spy (same name) can kill the strongest piece but only when attacking, flag, bombs, etc.) The game in turn likely drew on various ancient Chinese board games such as Lu Zhan Jun Qi or the classic children's game Jungle.&#10;&#10;From the box:&#10;&#10;The gameboard is your battlefield.  You have an army of men at your disposal and six bombs.  Your mission--protect your flag and capture your opponent's flag.&#10;&#10;Secretly place your men, bombs, and flag on the gameboard with these objectives in mind.  But remember your opponent is doing the same thing, so you must plan a defense as well as an offense.&#10;&#10;Once the armies are in place, advance your men.  When you're one space away from an enemy, attack.  You and your opponent declare ranks.  The lower-ranking man is captured and out of play.&#10;&#10;You control your pieces and risk your men in battles where the strength of your enemy is unknown. The suspense builds as your men move deeper into enemy territory. Move with caution and courage. The next piece you attack could be a bomb.  And when attacked, it could &quot;blast&quot; your man off the board and out of play.&#10;&#10;The first to capture an enemy flag is the winner!&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;     Stratego (Revised Edition) (aka Stratego Fire &amp; Ice)&#10;     The Generals&#10;     Stratego Legends&#10;     Stratego: Star Wars&#10;     Stratego: Lord of the Rings Trilogy Edition&#10;     Ultimate Stratego&#10;     Electronic Stratego&#10;     Stratego: Marvel Heroes&#10;     Stratego: Star Wars Saga Edition&#10;     Stratego: The Chronicles of Narnia &#226;&#128;&#147; The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe&#10;&#10;&#10;and numerous others.&#10;&#10;Similar to:&#10;&#10;    L'Attaque&#10;    Dover Patrol&#10;    Aviation: The Aerial Tactics Game of Attack and Defence&#10;    Battle of Britain (Gibsons English fifth edition)&#10;    Tri-Tactics&#10;    Sharpe's Attack&#10;    Jeu de la Quille&#10;    Admirals&#10;    Attack&#10;    Batalj&#10;    Game of the Generals&#10;    Lu Zhan Jun Qi (Land Army Chess)&#10;    Hai Lu Kong Zhan Qi (Sea-Land-Air Fighting Chess)&#10;    Si Guo Da Zhan (The Great Battle of Four Countries)&#10;    Jungle (&#233;&#172;&#165;&#231;&#141;&#184;&#230;&#163;&#139; (d&ograve;u sh&ograve;u q&iacute;) or &ldquo;Animal Chess&rdquo;)&#10;    Dong Wu Qi (&#229;&#139;&#149;&#231;&#137;&#169;&#230;&#163;&#139; or &ldquo;Animal Game&quot;)&#10;&#10;&#10;Different Edition Complications&#10;When first produced in Europe, the most powerful pieces had higher numbers.  I.e. the Marshall (most powerful piece) was a 10, the General was a 9, and so on.  The higher the rank, the higher the number.&#10;When they introduced Stratego in the USA, the numbering was reversed, so the Marshall was a 1, the General 2, and so on.  The 1st rank (most powerful) was 1, the second most powerful was 2, 3rd most powerful was 3....&#10;Then, in 2000s Hasbro re-imagined Stratego in the USA and made a few changes.  They reduced the number of pieces per side (from 40 to 30), added additional powers, and changed the numbering to reflect the European system.&#10;This caused extreme consternation with many faithful American Stratego fans who preferred the 'old way'.  (Actually the second oldest way, but whatever.)  Many of these insist on playing Stratego with the 'Marshall 1 system'.&#10;This wouldn't be a problem, except any and all discussions of Stratego are fraught with misunderstandings by those who are unaware of dual numbering systems!  Keep this in mind when reading information about Stratego.&#10;&#10;",
