    "description": "By the winter of 1942, the Red Army of Workers and Peasants had contained the German attacks of the previous summer and fall. Now came the time for a whole series of counter-offensive of its own, designed to cut off and destroy the weakened Nazi armies.&#10;&#10;The northernmost of these would be Operation &quot;Mars&quot;, aimed at the German Ninth Army around the city of Rzhev, west of Moscow in the winter of 1942. The Soviet plan, the work of the brilliant Marshal Georgi Zhukov, called for smashing the already-weakened Germans with a heavy commitment of tanks and fresh troops. When this first objective had been reached, a second operation, code-named Jupiter, would encircle and destroy the German 3rd Panzer Army to the south.&#10;&#10;Despite horrible weather and very rough forested terrain, the initial Soviet attacks went very well. But German resistance stiffened, and as the Red Army failed to make further progress Zhukov reacted by committing more and more men and tanks. Suicidal courage only added to the Soviet casualty lists, and by the time the offensive sputtered to a halt Soviet losses topped 335,000 men and 1,600 tanks.&#10;Little known thanks to Soviet government silence for 50 years, the offensive was designed as a companion to the &quot;Saturn&quot; offensive around Stalingrad. The fact that the offensive was repulsed with heavy losses meant it was not discussed in Soviet accounts of the Great Patriotic War. While the offensive failed to accomplish what the Soviet High Command and General Georgi Zhukov wished, it did provide what the Soviets needed most, a means of keeping German forces of Army Group Center in place while the Saturn offensive in the south ran its course.&#10;&#10;Red God of War covers Operation Mars using the same game system as Alsace 1945 and America Triumphant. Game pieces represent regiments, brigades and divisions. Headquarters are vital to activate units and send them into action; supply is also important to keeping your units at full efficiency and players must choose how to allocate their resources. There will never be enough of them to accomplish everything at once.&#10;&#10;Game Turn: 2 days&#10;Hex: 5 miles (8 kilometers) &#10;Units: Battalion to Corps&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;&#10;    One 22 x 34&quot; full color map&#10;    One dual-side printed countersheet (280 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;    One 16-page Red God of War rulebook&#10;    One 6-sided dice&#10;&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: Good&#10;Complexity Level: 1,5 out of 5&#10;Players: 2&#10;Playing Time: 60 to 120 minutes&#10;&#10;(Source: Avalanche Press website and game rulebook)&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Crystal blue seas, tropical heat and crazy nightclubs are Key West, the extreme tip of the Florida Keys and a paradise for people who enjoy a wild and thrilling existence, including people like the writer Ernest Hemingway who was attracted by more than just the sea and the bars.&#10;&#10;How will you make your way there?  You might make good money with hotels, but first bridges must be built so that tourists, artists and business people of all kinds can flock to the islands. Plantations and cigar factories can show lush profits as well. Adventurers are attracted out to sea, where they dive for sunken shipwrecks and treasures. But the bottom line in Key West is that wanting everything is never a good goal.  Don't get bogged down; stay cool and plan your actions like a pro.&#10;&#10;Key West is set in the 1930s and depicts the economic development of the Florida Keys. Players build hotels, maintain fruit plantations, buy cigar factories (both producing and selling), ensure that bridges are built, and search the deeps for treasure and wrecks. It features an original and surprising auction mechanism from Martin Schlegel.&#10;&#10;The game is divided into two parts: first bidding, then actions.  At the beginning of each of the eight rounds, there is a offers phase, in which players bid to secure Key West cards, which represent, for example, ownership of bridges and plantations and other benefits for the subsequent actions round. Individual actions are a finite and players will need to approach them tactically.  It often won't be possible to do everything one wants and what not to do an agonizing decision.&#10;&#10;Both experienced players and families will find something to like in Key West. There are seven different paths for generating victory points, but those who try to get involved everywhere won't succeed. The focus should be on three or four programs. In the next game one can try a different set.  As there are thus many combinations, the intentions is that matters stay fresh for many re-playings.&#10;&#10;An Essen 2010 game.

Most of the units are regiments and battalions, and the US regiments can break down into quasi battalion sized units in order to trade off strength for speed, and also to absorb combat loses.  The US, with more firepower and better artillery, has the upper hand but the dug in Spanish defenders, the Spanish relief column's arrival, and the ensuing Yellow fever will take its toll on the US forces and could turn a Splendid Little War into defeat.&#10;&#10;There are three short scenarios covering the major engagements of the campaign:&#10;- The battle for El Caney. &#10;- The infamous Rough Riders and the battle of San Juan Hill. &#10;- The combination of these two that covers the first day of the campaign.&#10;&#10;As well as the Campaign Game which covers the entire 14 days of battle from the initial US attack on July 1st until the Spanish surrender on July 14th.&#10;&#10;",

Specific training skills allow you to get extra tips from particular clients and/or drinks served.

If anything falls off the plate and stains the table, the player's turn ends immediately. A player can use only one hand and can touch only one noodle at a time at one point. If pulling a noodle causes a meatball to start rolling off the plate, the player can drop the noodle to try to catch the meatball. At the moment the meatball is grabbed, it cannot be touching any noodles on the plate. These skillfully caught meatballs are worth one point at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the plate is empty, with no pasta and no meatballs, and whoever scores the most points wins.&#10;&#10;There are two additional difficulty levels: Spaghetti Difficili and Spaghetti Superiori.&#10;&#10;&#10;    Spaghetti Difficili differs from the basic game in the number of meatballs (now four) and the size of plate on which spaghetti is served (players choose a small one).&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    In Spaghetti Superiori, players earn extra points for fulfilling Italian recipes. There are 12 recipe tokens in total, each shows spaghetti ingredients. Players must remove those ingredients to claim the token.

Border War is a solitaire game that puts you in the middle of that fighting as commander of a South African battlegroup based on the frontier. You conduct raids into Angolan territory, seize enemy base camps and, just as important, return to home base.&#10;&#10;The game includes two decks of cards. The Mission Cards provide scenario objectives and the resources with which battlegroups are assembled. The missions are drawn from historic cross-border raids, such as Operations Protea and Modular. You recruit from a variety of unit types, including recon, commandos, mechanized infantry, paratroopers, G-5 long-range artillery, and air support.&#10;&#10;Border War is part of the Commando mini-game series. Once a battlegroup is organized, you move it across the border. When a force enters certain points an Event Card is picked. Events can include anything from special intelligence information to the appearance of major enemy forces. There&rsquo;s a range of foes, from SWAPO insurgents and Angolan government regulars to powerful Cuban armored formations. Combat is resolved via a quasi-tactical procedure in which both tactical superiority and firepower play their parts. There are special rules for helicopter reaction forces, PSYOP, and leaders.&#10;&#10;",

Gameplay is fast and frenetic, allowing players to feel the tension of a cinematic assault with simulated real-time gameplay. Players control a team of 5 operators (all attackers or all defenders), with each Operator boasting different gadgets and abilities. Building your team of 5 is a very rewarding step of the game, offering endless possibilities and strategic choices. As the attacker, you will use your explosive arsenal to tear down walls and obstacles to reach your objective! As the defender, you will shape the battleground to your advantage and seek to thwart your opponent&rsquo;s plans by denying them chances to attack.&#10;&#10;To win a game of 6: Siege &ndash; The Board Game, you must fulfill the mission&rsquo;s objective for your side or eliminate the opposing team. During each round of the game, each player has two activation phases in which they can activate two to three operators. When activating an operator, a player has a wide range of actions to choose from: mandatory movement, shooting at targets, over-watching to cover specific areas, or making use of the team&rsquo;s or their personal gadgets! All this while time is ticking down&hellip; Operators can also lean to protect themselves while crouched, opening their line of sight without losing the benefit of cover. Every map of the game also has an upper floor that Operators can utilize when they want to navigate the map more quickly. The game rules are intuitive with how cinematic it is, and the flow of gameplay is bolstered as a result. Of course, we couldn&rsquo;t leave out a destructible environment! While the defenders often barricade the map, the attackers tend to break walls using grenades and hammers. The real-time flow of the game may be interrupted when a player calls for line of sight. If you think it is wrong, you could inflict a time penalty on your opponent&hellip; but also risk giving them the edge if you&rsquo;re proven wrong!

You intend to speed things along, but it will only work if the major personalities in the kingdom back your play. You need to buy, trick, or eliminate anyone who might stand in your way.&#10;&#10;In this solitaire Decktet game, personality cards represent different people in the kingdom who you need to control; personalities are the cards done up like face cards, with two close ups of a single figure. All of the other cards represent elements which you can use to control personalities. Your goal is to &quot;influence&quot; every personality card in the deck by paying one or more cards from your resource row that each share at least one suit with the targeted personality and have a combined value of at least the personality cards value.&#10;&#10;If you influence all the personalities in the deck than you win! Miss even one though, or end up with no available moves, and its the headsman's block for you.&#10;&#10;",

Each player controls a faction of revolutionaries&mdash;Workers, Students, Neighbors, or Prisoners&mdash;fighting against the State in the streets of a city that change with each game. Build barricades, clash with riot cops, occupy districts, loot shopping centers, and liberate the city before time runs out and the military arrives! Bloc by Bloc features hidden agendas, deep strategy, area control, asymmetrical player abilities, and a special method for randomly generating billions of unique city layouts. Bloc by Bloc 2nd edition features brand new art, streamlined gameplay, improved components and new objectives for the insurrection!&#10;&#10;The game lasts up to 10 rounds. Each round is 1 night and each night has 2 phases. During the Nighttime phase, each player takes a turn: 3-5 actions followed by a police response that is controlled by the Police Ops deck and the level of Police Morale. Each player starts with 2 blocs in the city and can add more throughout the game. On a player's turn, they roll dice and take one action (such as looting, occupying, attacking, or barricading) for each die rolled with 1+ of their blocs. Players may use loot cards to enhance their actions. After all factions have taken their turns, the Sunrise phase begins, which is when police go on the attack and factions have a chance to liberate districts.&#10;&#10;The police and the State are the common enemies of all factions. Factions must build occupations in all of their own districts for the social insurrection to be successful. However, each faction also has its own secret agenda with a set of specific tasks that faction must complete in order to win the game. The majority of factions will have Social Agendas and they must cooperate to win the game together. But some factions may have Vanguardist or Nihilist Agendas that secretly pit them against the social insurrection. These factions can only win the game alone!&#10;&#10;&#10;The 2nd edition features a brand new art, streamlined gameplay, improved components and new objectives for the insurrection!&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "From the publisher:&#10;&#10;Liber Militum Tercios is a new historical wargame that will allow us to recreate the great battles of the Thirty Years&rsquo; War. The game was developed by El Kraken Released, team, and is edited by Design &amp; Edits WxW Co.&#10;&#10;There are 2 different versions of Tercios:&#10;Liber Militum: The full version&#10;Brevis Editio: Short Version, synthesized and free.&#10;&#10;Portada-Brevis-EditioTercios is not intended for any specific miniatures scale. All rule design effort was put on allowing the player to adapt the game to any different model basing and scales.. However, we do recommend certain model sizes for units on the rules, but others could be used without compromising playability. Geometry dependence has been avoided as much as possible.&#10;&#10;The number of miniatures that is necessary to represent a unit is subject to the sole discretion of the Army Collector, it is up to everyone to decide how many models will be enough to identify our troops. Even so, we suggest certain number in the rules, but just for guidance.&#10;&#10;Tercios is a large scale wargame, since each unit in the game represents huge formations that often comprised more than a thousand men. This is why it is a game with more abstraction than others, because at this scale of war reenactment, individual soldier actions has no consecuences, it matters as a whole..&#10;&#10;The gameplay is based upon orders execution, that are deployed at a planning phase. Command cards are used (there are 5 different cards), that are placed face down next to our units, and prepare our troops for different tasks: to run, to shoot, charge the enemy or resist stoically.&#10;&#10;Units activation is alternated between players. The very command cards allow us to keep track of which units have been activated. The fact that the turns are not complete for a single player, but alternated between the two players, make the game a fluid dynamic experience. Once all the command cards have been executed, the turn will be finished and we will be ready to start a new one.&#10;&#10;Cards also allow us to react, under certain circumstances, to enemy activity, what makes commands a complex tactical resource.. Deepening in the mastering of good decisions during the planning phase and managing the unexpected is a challenge for the player; reflective strategic fund is stimulated, what makes the experience very intuitive and agile..&#10;&#10;Not knowing what cards your opponent has set and choosing the order of activation for your units, makes a very realistic simulation of the uncertainties of a real battle and delivers an increasing thrill, as the turns pass by..&#10;&#10;As usual in wargames, actions are resolved by rolling dices. Tercios proposes a very simple system using six-sided dice; no need to do complex calculations, or having to learn a host of special rules. For a player with minimum experience (or without) it will be a matter of minutes to become familiar with the system.&#10;&#10;",

It is a beautiful book in its own right with hundreds of colour photo of the most exquisitely painted model soldiers taken from the world s foremost collections. The rule book's intention is to inspire a collector to play gentlemanly games with their collections of soldiers with friends where the emphasis is on the spirit of the period, not the letter of the rule. It is a hearty publication and not for nitpickers or miseries. There are some good gags in it, but it also plays well and enables players to conduct a very big battle in a reasonable period of time, leaving them more time to chat about the highs and lows and what ifs...&quot;&#10;&#10;Pike &amp; Shotte closes the gap that Warlord Games left between the &quot;Hail Caesar&quot; and the &quot;Black Powder&quot; rulebooks. Using the hallmark Warlord Games orders system (a player must state what his units are about to do, then make a leadership roll dice to check the efficiency with whom of the order given is received), with a 3-phases turn modality that clearly brings the Rick Priestley firm, the game is very smooth, fast and less detailed and mechanic than its stronger competitor, the Field of Glory Renaissance system.&#10;&#10;",

After a construction phase, trip-tests verify the best and quickest lines.&#10;&#10;The mechanism is easy: during his turn, a player puts 3 line counters on the board. If his line meets another line, a station is built where the two connect. The subway network is developed through this process. Because the grid on the board and the line counters are triangular, players have some real placement questions.&#10;&#10;The game is very interactive, with players sometimes trying to cooperate and sometimes trying to stop other lines. They also choose, during the construction phase, the start and the end of the final trip-tests. But it's never the same player who places both start and end, so a player must anticipate and guess carefully.&#10;&#10;",

Each game lasts two periods, and each period comes with a mid-game scoring. Each period consists of two phases: the drafting phase and the action phase.&#10;&#10;During the drafting phase, players take cards from the display until they have six cards in hand.&#10;&#10;During the action phase, players take turns playing a card from hand to build a preparation line until all cards have been played. With these cards, players can get resources, move ships, trigger special actions, and (probably) take free actions.&#10;&#10;The most intriguing part of the game is that players need to build the preparation line with cards and create ideal combinations between the cards as  cards create a hub that provides players with a bonus when ships arrive at it. Additionally, players should acquire enough licences for their journey to go smoothly. After two periods, the player who has the most penguin points wins and is clearly the one who saw the most penguins in the Antarctic.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

If the captured piece is itself on a stack, only the top piece is captured, and the underlying pieces are thus &quot;liberated&quot;. This means pieces are never permanently removed, but stacks get steadily higher throughout the game.&#10;&#10;According to Abstract Games magazine issue 1, the game has a revival in Russia, with tournaments being held in St. Petersburg regularly.&#10;&#10;Bashni was the inspiration for Laska, Chess world champion Emanuel Lasker's stacking game, that is better known in the west.&#10;&#10;",

Each player takes the role of an intrepid adventurer who will help the group overcome great perils. However, some among them are conniving doppelg&auml;ngers who work against the party to bring their downfall.&#10;&#10;Each turn the players confront a challenge that requires teamwork.  The party leader selects which adventurers will help him win the encounter. Everyone selected contributes a card to the pool, and others are added from the draw pile. The party leader then distributes one item to each party member to help them in their quest. Success brings rewards and moves the party closer to uncovering the hidden truth. Failure brings pain and moves the doppelg&auml;ngers one step closer to victory.&#10;&#10;Doppelg&auml;nger feels like a fast, co-operative dungeon delve, but with the added tension of significant distrust.&#10;&#10;Game Overview&#10;&#10;Each round, the players confront a new Quest that requires teamwork, and a rotating Party Leader selects which adventurers go on that Quest. Every player selected contributes one Item card to a common pool, and other items are added randomly from the draw pile. These cards can be helpful, non-helpful, or even harmful. The Party Leader distributes one card to each party member, and the Quest commences, with each player taking a turn using the item they were given, if able. To use the items given, each player uses dice that are secretly pulled and rolled, but beware, doppelg&auml;ngers may choose to roll cursed dice! If the party succeeds, the Party Leader may search for an Artifact of Light. Find three of these, and the loyal adventurers win the game. However, if a Quest fails, an Artifact of Darkness may be found, and if three are uncovered, the doppelg&auml;ngers win. Players must also take care to watch their health, because if any player dies, the game ends, and the dead player's loyalty determines the winners and losers.&#10;&#10;",

As a group, you will solve a series of puzzles to unravel a mystery.&#10;&#10;When you have solved a puzzle, you will enter the answer into the companion web app (compatible with all smart phones and computers) and it will check whether you are correct. If you are, the app will tell you which card or cards to take next.&#10;&#10;The app also contains a graduated hint system, so if you get stuck you can get just a small hint about the current puzzle to get moving again without giving too much away.&#10;&#10;Puzzles may test your perception, wordplay, and lateral thinking. English language fluency is required.&#10;&#10;Most groups take about an hour to solve the game. You can write on the cards to help solve puzzles, but this is not required (or you could use penny sleeves) and the game is otherwise non-destructable.

But as they&rsquo;re lost they are difficult to replace, while Soviet power just keeps surging.&#10;&#10;Like Defiant Russia, Red Vengeance isn't a very large game. The 17x22-inch map fits easily on a small table. There are 140 playing pieces, and it comes in a small box that's easy to store. The game plays very quickly, concluding in about 90 minutes, with a minimum of charts and tables to consult.&#10;&#10;",

Over the ages, Nexus soared to incredible wealth and power. Wandering tribes flocked to the city to worship and learn from the mysterious magicks beneath it.&#10; As Nexus grew, more and more power was drawn from the well. And as more power was drawn, the more unstable the energies of the well became. After millennia of providing Nexus with knowledge and might, the well gave the city something new. Blight.&#10;&#10;Beneath Nexus is an asymmetrical dungeon crawling card game for 3 to 6 players. One player acts as the Blight Lord, an evil overlord who corrupted the great city of Nexus centuries ago. All other players play the heroes who have come to Nexus to reclaim it from the powerful Blight Lord.&#10;&#10;Beneath Nexus's fantasy theme was inspired by the big tabletop rpgs like D&amp;D, Pathfinder, and Dungeonworld. Players of Magic: the Gathering, Sentinels of the Multiverse, and Lunch Money will recognize the card-based mechanics and gameplay.&#10;&#10;We at Silverclutch Games created Beneath Nexus for hobbyist gamers to introduce casual gamers and new players to fantasy adventure. Beneath Nexus can be learned within 10 minutes and is both competitive and cooperative with its one vs many format. Hobbyist gamers will find the unique heroes and Blight Lords engaging and challenging to master due to variable player powers, difficult dungeon cards, and the vast array of monsters to combat with their own unique abilities.&#10;&#10;",

Create a team based on a set salary cap, choose strategy cards that will solidify their strengths, and select the stadium that will give you an unbeatable home field advantage.&#10;&#10;Every at bat includes two basic elements&ndash;the Pitch &amp;  Swing. To keep it simple: the Pitch determines who will get the advantage in the at bat, and the Swing determines the result of the at bat.&#10;&#10;The game is played and scored just like traditional baseball using player cards that are Batters and Pitchers from real big league teams with suitable stats on a playmat resembling a baseball field. Play a full game (9 innings) consisting of  3  outs  per  &frac12;  inning,  with  the  Away  Manager  batting  in  the  top  half  of  the  inning. As you send each batter card up to the plate, there is a pitch roll and a swing roll to determine the result (out, walk, hit, home run, etc).&#10;&#10;Batter cards move around the bases to score runs like in real baseball. The game ends after 9 innings with the team that scored more runs being the winner - in the event of a tie you go to extra innings until one team comes out ahead!&#10;&#10;Strategy cards played at different times give bonuses or allow you to make real baseball plays like hit-and-run, defensive shifts or even a suicide squeeze.

You are approaching the most wicked Idol Ugly Snouts ever forged, but you will have to run through dangerous rooms and face monstrous creatures and even other fierce explorers to take it.&#10;&#10;Tzulan Quest is a frenzy card game where you have to move your explorer towards the central room and reach the golden Idol there running through many perilous rooms. Each player has a bunch of cards to pass them or prevent his opponents to do it.&#10;&#10;Cards can be used in two ways: as a key to pass a room of a certain kind or as an action that can slow your opponents or give you advantages. You can use as many cards as you can during your turn. If you have no cards in your hand during you turn, you draw three new ones immediately and end your turn.&#10;&#10;You can ask your opponents for the card you need offering everything you want as a trade: other cards, money, marriage proposals and any other service or object that pass through your head and let your opponent accept the deal. If he does, both of you gain a gem. Gems can be used to increase the effect of a card you are playing, drawing cards and passing through rooms for free. You gain gems defeating dreadful monsters too with the whip.&#10;&#10;",

The other players send you contacts who'll contribute to your scheme and they'll tell you who they are but you can't see them yet. During the game a player isn't always allowed to talk, so there is a chance you can't be told who is joining your scheme. As soon as you have gathered enough contacts one random contact will join your scheme and you'll check you succeeded or failed.&#10;&#10;As long as all schemes succeed everything goes as planned, but as soon as a scheme fails the guards are getting suspicious and the person who was responsible will have to draw cards of the interrogation deck. There is a chance the guards will convince you to become a snitch. When this happens your only goal is to make sure the other players don't escape. As more schemes fail tension will build. Can you still trust the other inmates or are they lying to you?&#10;&#10;When enough schemes have succeeded a gun is smuggled into the prison and you'll vote who it the one player who'll receive the gun. Is there still somebody present who you can all trust to handle the gun? As soon as the gun is handed over the owner of the gun must decide. Will he shoot somebody to make sure he won't prevent the escape? Or do you still trust everyone with the risk the snitch is still among you...&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Vandering Publishing's Shipwreck is a very basic game of modern naval warfare.  It already has one supplement released - &quot;Freeplay '88&quot;, dealing with a NATO exercise in 1988.&#10;&#10;The game has been compared to &quot;Harpoon 4&quot;, perhaps unfairly, as while it covers the same topic (modern naval warfare), the aim is present a much more global scope.  Command of small fleets of ships is very easy in this game, as weapon effectiveness is determined by a single value and weapon damage is a single value (heavy, medium, light, etc).&#10;&#10;Ship damage are represented by a damage area with 4 damage levels - two 'lights', a 'heavy', and a 'critical' damage level.  When a weapon damages a ship, a d10 is rolled and the weapon's size is compared against the size of the target ship on a chart to see the resulting damage level (with a chance of 'none' being one of the levels).  If the given damage level is already called for, the next level up is used.  The net effect is as mirrored by hypothetical naval combat - ships take very few hits to be 'mission killed'.&#10;&#10;Detection is handled within the rules in a very basic way, although special note should be made of the submarine rules.  They make use of 'range bands' around a target ship.  Submarines are not placed on the 'board' unless detected, making their approach and attack on these 'range band' diagrams, essentially their exact position unknown to BOTH players - neatly avoiding the need for a third player as referee almost always required in other games of the type.&#10;&#10;The production values of the game are fairly high - no counters or maps are included, but, given the nature of most modern naval games to use miniatures or simply graph paper, that's certainly forgivable.  The game manual itself is printed on glossy paper with plenty of images throughout (several pages include color images) that really set the mood for the game.&#10;&#10;",
