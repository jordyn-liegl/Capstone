Each player represents one of the famous cities: Athens, Corinth, Thebes, or Sparta.  &#10;  &#10;In order to demonstrate power and strength, warriors and mighty heroes must be displayed in splendid parades. However, it is also valid to use the favor and gifts of the fickle Gods of Mount Olympus as skillfully and impressively as possible.  &#10;  &#10;Each City State card set has the same number and type of Warrior/Hero cards and God cards. Warrior/Hero cards have values between 2 and 10. Gods have certain abilities that can change the displayed values dramatically. In the game, each player must try to use his 25 cards as skillfully as possible in order to collect the most Fame points.  &#10;  &#10;The game extends over three Parades, each of which has three Marches. Fame scoring occurs after each March. The city with the lowest display loses Fame points. The two cities with the highest displays earn Fame points. Twice only during the entire game, each city may send emissaries to the mighty oracle at Delphi, in order to beg for her aid and, possibly, turn Fate in their favor.&#10;&#10;",

In this game, players are wealthy CEOs who bribe politicians to gain political power and influence. Players must be careful, however, because political scandal might bring down one's political friends and all of one's invested money. Players who use their money wisely to bribe the right politicians will be victorious.&#10;&#10;OUTLINE OF GAME PLAY&#10;The object of the game is to score the most Victory Points. You win Victory Points by having the highest total bribe on any of the five Politicians. On your turn, you will receive and play Money Cards and/or Power Cards. You bribe a Politician by placing a Money Card next to, and on your side of, a Politician Card (which are in the center of the table). The bribes grow as more Money Cards are played on the same Politicians. Power Cards are used to perform a variety of actions and are discarded after use (such as stealing other people's bribes). At game's end, all the bribes are revealed and tallied up. Players score Victory Points for each Politician that they have 'won' by having the biggest bribe. The player with the most Victory Points wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Darwin&rsquo;s Dice is a simple, fast-paced trump card game, where two dice set the conditions of every turn. You&rsquo;ll need both a tactical approach as well as a fair amount of luck. Two to four players meet in this game for a struggle of sheer survival. Only the player who&rsquo;s best prepared and whose cards match the conditions can obtain the opponents&rsquo; cards and collect points.&#10;&#10;Before each turn a player &ndash; the Darwin &ndash; rolls the dice. The combination of number (1 to 8) and colour (blue, green and yellow) determine which card becomes the trump during this turn. Additionally, one die (with + and -) specifies if high or low numbers have an advantage.&#10;Each player then plays a card upside down and then flip them over simultaneously. The player of the strongest card wins, becomes the new Darwin and rolls the dice for the next turn.&#10;&#10;The strongest card is either the trump or &ndash; of no trump has been played &ndash; the highest or the lowest card. If it comes to a draw, the size of the animal is of the essence (+ for big / - for small). But there are three special cards as well:&#10;The red cards (1 to 8), if they should win a turn, although they are not able of becoming the trump and will always lose in a draw, they can destroy the collected cards of the player with the second best card.&#10;The grey cards (0 and 9) are always the highest or lowest numbers. They can only be beaten by the trump.&#10;The brown cards (4.5) are the worst cards, because they are neither the highest nor the lowest cards - they are right in the middle. But if the trump has been played, they are the only ones able to beat it.&#10;&#10;A game consists of several rounds, each consisting of individual turns. Each turn consists of rolling the dice and playing one card. A round is over when all the hand cards have been played. The game is over when the card deck is used up.&#10;&#10;At the end of each round &ndash; after all the hand cards have been played &ndash; the points of the cards, according to the number of symbols in the corner, are counted and written down. These points are safe and cannot be destroyed. &#10;At the end of the game &ndash; when the card deck is used up &ndash; the player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;",

Sculptures, drawings, jewelry, clothes, constructions of different shapes and sizes. The work of Artisans has shaped the history of art and some creations have reached such worldwide fame; they influence even the modern world.&#10;&#10;Artisans is a fast and exciting but challenging family card game for 2 to 4 players which lasts 30 to 45 minutes. Players are trying to develop their skills in the use of seven different materials: clay, metal, wood, stone, gold, glass and textiles in such a way so that their level of expertise in these materials grants them the necessary skills to craft beautiful Art objects.&#10;&#10;Each player chooses initially one from the nine available Artisan profiles. Each Artisan has a unique ability which helps and defines the strategy of the players. Additionally, each player takes randomly 6 material cards. Finally, 4 Art objects are drawn randomly and become available for crafting. All the material cards are depicting the level of skill (I -&gt; IV) in each of their corners and all the Art objects are depicting the materials and the required level of skill which the players need to have so they can craft them.&#10;&#10;A game is played in 12 rounds (the months of a year), where players are trying to craft Art objects and win victory points. Each round has 2 phases.&#10;&#10;During the first phase, players are either sequentially trading or collecting material cards from a central market or craft one of the available Art objects. The first phase ends when one player signifies the closing of the market by claiming the first player token. Then all other players have one last chance to visit the market.&#10;&#10;In the second phase, players are developing their skills by playing any number of cards of one material type of their choice. Every additional time they play the same material they upgrade their skill to the next level. However, they cannot play more cards than those that they have played on the previous level. Through this smart mechanism the number of cards played in each level matters, because at the end of the game every single material card scores points equal to the said level.&#10; In the end of the 12 rounds players are counting the points from the crafted Art objects plus the points for the material cards and any additional points that their Artisan&rsquo;s profile may score. The player with the most points is declared the winner!&#10;&#10;Use the material market to your benefit, claim the first player token in the right time to close the market and smartly manage your material cards in an effective way! The numerous combinations, the great replay ability, the strategic decisions and the challenging competition will leave anyone satisfied! Embrace the role of an Artisan and let the beautiful artwork take you on a journey through art and history!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

There are 256 trail tiles showing the parallel lines the skis make in the snow. These go in straight lines, diagonals, turns and sharp turns and a few have 2 trails making crossovers. Players draw ten tiles from the face-down pile and show them. The first player lays as many tiles as possible to make a ski trail down from the top of the hill avoiding the trees, then draws back to ten tiles. A player may choose to use its turn to swap tiles with the pool instead of playing. If your trail is totally blocked, you may remove tiles laid and try again. &#10;When a skier reaches the bottom of the hill, the others may finish their turns. Any finisher gets 25 bonus points, then each player scores their trail, according to the tiles they laid. The straights are worth 1 point, turns 2 pts, sharp turns 3 pts and crossovers are 10 pts. Then deduct the tiles left in hand and the highest total wins.&#10;In the solitaire game, the player draws 50 tiles and tries to make a trail using all 50.&#10;&#10;The rules are in English, French and German and refer to the board as a plastic sheet rolled in a tube, presumably the earlier edition. A slip in the box has trademark Terry Martin Rose and a company address Franklin Merchandising Co in Chicago.&#10;&#10;Nancy Greene (1943 - ) is Canada's most famous skier and it was not a surprise when her name and picture was added to the Canadian version.&#10;&#10;The Waddingtons edition must have been produced after the tube edition, as the rules text refers to unfurling the plastic sheet although the game has a standard board. The box has a copyright date of 1970. The tile count is different from the enclosed slip too, with 4 more straights, and 2 fewer of each hairpin turn.&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;",

It adds 2400 questions, a xylophone for playing and guessing melodies, and cards for guessing images and shapes.&#10;&#10;The questions are grouped into 16 different topics, and the teams draw tiles from a bag to decide which topics they must answer. Teams must answer one question in each of the categories drawn. Correct answers are valued 1, 2, 3 or 4 points,&#10;depending on the order in which they are answered. The teams determine for themselves in which order the questions are asked. Opponents can by playing a limited number of special tiles, reorder, steal topics or being a Bezzerwizzer ('know-it-alls') by answering other participants' questions (before the question is being read or after the team can not answer).&#10;&#10;",

Contending against them were the Kingdom of France, the Ottoman Empire and miscellaneous minor states, as well as the rising tide of Protestantism.&#10;&#10;HRE is primarily intended to be played by four, each representing a different major power: the Hapsburgs, France, the Ottomans, and the &ldquo;League&rdquo; (the latter representing assorted minor power coalitions that came and went). Each player has a variety of military and political instruments with which he can attempt to gain control of Europe. The rules are written with procedures for four-player games in mind; however, games with three or two players can also be managed by using the altered framework provided for such contests.&#10;&#10;",

Words optional.&#10;&#10;You start with five cards, a head, torso, legs and two arms.  Each round you&rsquo;ll choose whether to spend the Stitches you&rsquo;ve earned to Scavenge a new part from a common pot, or to Attack your fellow monsters and take one of their limbs instead. As you attack each other you&rsquo;ll learn new words, giving you more options than just growling and grunting to communicate.  Once your monster is strong enough, attack the Abomination to try and win the game, pulling in any other players who have words in common. But beware! The King will fight back&hellip;&#10;&#10;Stitches uses a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors mechanic for combat that is easy to understand but can lead to some surprisingly deep decisions. Players decide whether to Scavenge or Attack simultaneously, then resolve their chosen action in turn order.  The semi-co-op mechanic of teams building as the game continues sets a natural limit to how each game lasts.&#10;&#10;",

Taking up position on the French left, they prepared for the German onslaught at the town of Mons. German General Alexander von Kuck's First Army was quick in coming. After a day long fight at Mons, the British fell back in a delaying action, eventually making a stand at Le Cateau. But the time they had bought proved critical in the upcoming Battle of the Marne&quot;.&#10;&#10;The Marne, 5-10 September 1914 : &quot;Following their defeat in the &quot;Battle of the Frontiers&quot;, the Allied armies retreated westwards, pursued by the Germans. The French chief commander, Field Marshal Joffre, decided to make a stand south of the Marne River. The German, changing their initial Schlieffen Plan, attacked through the gap between Paris and the Allied left wing, further to the east. Their intent was to destroy the Allied armies in one grand battle of annihilation. But the plan went awry. The Germans had outrun their lines of communication, and it was difficult for them to replace their losses while the Allies, with their ever shortening lines of communication, quickly regained strength. At the critical moment, the French Paris Garrison counterattacked on the extended German right flank. The resulting conflagration caused the German to pull back. The Allied armies were saved and the deadlock on the Western Front would soon begin.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Conquest Tactics is a strategy card game with a fantasy theme. Players lead their armies across a battlefield to clash with their opponent, employing hand management, resource allocation and battlefield strategy to outwit each other. Players deploy troop cards to a grid battlefield and pay tactical points to move, attack and cast spells. Skills and Spells are taught to a player's entire army and reused each turn. Each player chooses from a selection of victory conditions and must achieve three victory conditions to win the match.&#10;&#10;The first chapter of Conquest Tactics features three army factions, but troops from different factions may be combined into one deck. The initial factions are:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Humans: A balanced faction with a wide variety of Spells and Skills&#10;    Kaborha: A powerhouse faction with strong, expensive troops and an emphasis on melee skills&#10;    The Malice: A swarming faction with overwhelming numbers and a penchant for dark magic&#10;&#10;&#10;For five hundred years, human civilization languished under the rule of the Kaborha, a society focused solely on honor, battle, and a tri-annual tournament for supremacy.  Now a young hero has emerged, bringing hope of returning humanity to its former glory. But even as Humans rise up against their oppressors, a new threat has come to their world.  The Malice -an interdimensional army of evil creatures- has descended upon the homeland of the Kaborha and Humans, lurching the Fire Continent out of a centuries long stagnation and into war! Traditional ways will be broken and unlikely alliances formed to repel the oncoming evil. Only you have the power to determine the future of the Fire Continent and the world of Yen-Sen.&#10;&#10;The time has come for you to lead your chosen forces into battle in Conquest Tactics, a new strategy card game.  Choose your Victory Conditions and your Base, assemble your Troops and march them across the battlefield.  Teach them Spells and Skills to use again and again, and empower them with Equipment.  Bend fate in your favor with Circumstance cards, and claim powerful relics as your Trophies.  Vanquish your enemies by using real strategy, movement and range to your advantage. Never before has a collectible card game given you this much control and this level of strategic choice.&#10;&#10;Rather than pursue a single goal, Conquest Tactics has several different Victory Conditions that can be achieved in order to win. You might choose to invade and occupy your opponent&rsquo;s side of the field, destroy their base, challenge troops that are stronger than your own, or upgrade a troop to it&rsquo;s highest potential.  As a reward for achieving a Victory Condition, you are bestowed a Trophy which grants a special onetime benefit, such as the ability to draw extra cards, deal additional damage or search for the perfect troop you need at the moment.&#10;&#10;Each army in Conquest Tactics has its own types of troops. Unique to the world of Conquest Tactics are the Kaborha, a strong and proud race matching the cunning of humans with raw animalistic power. Troop cards have deployment, movement, and attack costs. The troop card also lists the damage done by the troop in an attack and the ability of the troop to defend itself. Finally, each troop card details the health of the troop and any special abilities that unit may have.  Some troops have the ability to cast magic or use special skills.&#10;&#10;When your Troops can't get by on courage alone, give them Equipment to better their chances of survival.  Equipment comes in three varieties: Armor, Weapons and Accessories.  These improvements attach directly to a Troop, making it more powerful in the midst of battle.  Troops may also use spells and skills on the battlefield.  Spell cards consist of fire, light and dark magic that may be used to heal, harm, cripple and defend in battle. However, only troops that are able to cast a particular type of magic are able to use that magic's spells. These abilities are put into your Knowledge Pool where they may be used repeatedly throughout the game by your various troops, but they have a cost each time they are used and may only be used once per turn.&#10;&#10;Each deck has one base which serves as a stronghold and is one of the principal sources of a player's power.  Bases give their armies additional strengths such as the ability to upgrade troops faster or replace fallen troops. However, Bases are not without their weakness as they may be destroyed, removing the benefits granted by it.&#10;&#10;Circumstance cards may be played at any time and do not need to be cast by a troop with the ability to use magic.  These cards may enable you to increase your tactical points, negate an attack or even reflect an attack back at a troop when your opponent least expects it!  Circumstance cards are paid for using the cards in your hand. If you don't have enough cards to discard from your hand you can't use your circumstance cards, thus hand management is another essential skill in Conquest Tactics.&#10;&#10;",

In fact, he showed affection and appreciation to each son in descending order of their birth.  Over time, this greatly displeased his younger sons to the point of confrontation.  Being respectful to their father, the younger two sons did not accuse their father directly, but merely asked the question:  &quot;What more can I do to earn your respect?&quot;  At first the father was outraged that his younger sons would question his fidelity, but then he realized their defiance presented an opportunity.&#10;&#10;His land had been plagued by prankster Dragon that ate his crops, scared away his workers and generally caused chaos throughout his land.  He decided to put his younger sons to the test of ridding his land of this Dragon.  The sons agreed, but pleaded:  &quot;Should our older brothers be denied this opportunity to prove their devotion to you?&quot;  Knowing full well his sons' intent, Wei Fu agreed to send all five sons on the quest.  However, his older sons, fearful for their safety, begged for a reprieve.  Acquiescing, Wei Fu decided to ease the burden by declaring:  &quot;The Dragon is the quest!  However, I would still appreciate any son who brings me the finest examples of the Five Elements of Water, Wood, Fire, Earth, and Metal, which provide the very foundation of our world.&quot;  With this alternative quest, he would assign the easier tasks to his older sons&mdash;or so he thought.&#10;&#10;Weilong or &quot;Powerful Dragon&quot; is a simple dice game based loosely on the dice game One-O-Five and the Chinese card game Shou Ba Yi.  Each player represents the role of one of Wei Fu's sons on their quest to collect the Five Elements or capture the Dragon.  Each player rolls their dice and sets aside those dice showing their target number (Element).  The objective is to roll all five dice of the target number before any other player.  Target numbers are determined by drawing cards (Son Cards).   The Son Cards also have unique abilities for the players.&#10;&#10;Once a player has set aside all five dice of the target number or captured the Dragon (by collecting the dice 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5), the remaining players add up the total of the dice they have collected along with the penalty number at the bottom of the card and track those points.  Your goal is have the lowest point total each round and for the game.  The Son cards are then passed to the left and the next round begins (5 Player Game).  The winner is the player who has the least amount of points after 5 rounds.&#10;&#10;",

You try to gain control of an artist at high value, or pass artists from one player to another to make them devalue. Scoring occurs when players choose to put on concerts at the end of their turn, including a gala show which doubles the value. The game rules state that the designers produced this game by phone and fax, without ever meeting. Perhaps that shows, as it has interest, but the game uses a sand-timer to apply pressure to your decisions.&#10;&#10;",

As you piece the map together you are drawn into the turbulent times of the Han dynasty in a land of mystical kingdoms. Take the role of the legendary warlords,found in Luo Guanzhong&rsquo;s epic tale, &ldquo;Romance of the Three Kingdoms.&rdquo; Capture lands and build castles to extend and defend your kingdom.&#10;&#10;Cartography is a land claiming game with a twist, players become mapmakers in a game that takes creativity and foresight to claim land on a map that changes with each turn. Cartography builds on the ancient territory claiming game &quot;Go&quot; by adding a map-making mechanism. The map is made up of triangular tiles, with rivers that divide the map, allowing lands to be defended or captured. Players create and claim land, then capture opponents, in an effort to control the map.&#10;&#10;The map changes as you play so you must keep your wits about you.&#10;&#10;Players start by selecting tiles to create land and extend the map.  Castles are then placed on the land you claim or capture, and whoever has most castles &ndash; those they place on the land and those they capture &ndash; wins.  Because the landscape changes on every turn, you must be vigilant as a stronghold can quickly turn into a weakness, and as you try to surround other players&rsquo; castles, they might also be surrounding you! In planning your strategy on where to build your castles, you must carefully choose between expanding and consolidating, and between attacking and defending.&#10;&#10;Strategy is key and chance doesn't determine the winner. The 2nd Edition features an alternative play option with an element of luck through random draw of three land tiles kept hidden in your hand.&#10;&#10;Cartography is a Social Abstract Game SAG for 2 to 4 players.&#10;&#10;",

The region just below North Vietnam, Quang Tri province, was especially vulnerable to threats from the North Vietnamese Army (NVA) in the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) and across the Laotian border. For almost a year the US Marines had been fighting to stabilize the DMZ region.&#10;&#10;Khe Sanh was the outpost intended to block and seal off the NVA's access to Quang Tri from the west (Laos), where many of the NVA's base areas were located. Other fortifications barred the DMZ. In early 1968, the NVA countered by assembling large forces around Khe Sanh, threatening a battle for the place. The American command focused its attention upon Quang Tri, and even more, Khe Sanh. The ensuing campaign pitted South Vietnamese and American forces, at the peak of their combat efficiency, against a tough NVA enemy. At stake was victory in the Vietnam War.&#10;&#10;Khe Sanh, 1968 game&#10;&#10;    Full color 22&quot;x34&quot; map&#10;    200 full color die cut counters&#10;    Rulebook length - 16 pages&#10;&#10;&#10;Complexity - Medium&#10;Solitaire Suitability - Low&#10;&#10;",

In 1977 the Mishler Company purchased the rights for NORAD. Only minor changes were made on the game board and the unit counters. However, several changes were made in the rules, and the solitaire game was completely re-done and the 'Assigned Targets' optional rule was added. The historical simulation aspect was improved by giving the American player the capability to hide the exact location of his/her fighters. Also, the Russian bombers may no longer fly endlessly back and forth across the game board. In addition, several rules and the number of units was changed to balance the game.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

It uses a popular game mechanics: Scotland Yard, Mister X, and Fury of Dracula.  The mechanics is modified, of course.&#10;&#10;Players must work together to capture the arch-villain, Dr. Lindt.  There are various ways to find out where Dr. Lindt was within a few turns before the current one.  There are also traps that Dr. Lindt sets on his path (special cards are used).  Detectives (characters from the book) can avoid falling into those traps by using different tools, which are also depicted on cards.  Each detective gets a certain number of those cards at the beginning of the game.&#10;&#10;The game is designed in sepia colours, using actual historical photographs of Moscow, end of the 19th century.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "A slapstick game of hockey management (endorsed by Howie Meeker, a Canadian hockey personality of the time).&#10;&#10;Everybody knows that professional hockey game is won or lost on the ice, right?  Wrong.  The game that starts when the referee's whistle sounds is only half the story.  See that character on the end clutching the bankroll?  He's the team manager.  What you don't get to see is the game HE plays-and it's every bit as tough as the one on the ice.  Now's your chance to get the inside story.  In Face Off, you manage your own hockey franchise.  That means you have to scramble for league Superstars, trade players, and try to put together the strongest team you can --without running out of cash.  It means you have to cope with temperamental players, broken contracts, and unexpected expenses.&#10;&#10;Of course, you get to manage your team through a season of hockey games, to see how your planning and conniving pays off!  And who wins the playoffs?  Usually the strongest team --but it's up to you to make it that way.&#10;&#10;This game deserves to be better known; the theme is rather under-exploited and Waddingtons' treatment hits just the right tongue-in-cheek note here.  If you liked Avalon Hill's Slapshot, you'll like Face Off.  The Canadian edition is bilingual with a two-sided board (English on one side, French on the other).&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "QUARTINO Did you always want to try an abstract boardgame, but were afraid of Chess, Checkers was too boring, and nobody was willing to teach you Go? QUARTINO is just for you! This dynamic and clever game from Czech author Petr Doubek shall satisfy your gaming needs&hellip;&#10;&#10;QUARTINO is an original abstract strategy game with simple rules. It is full of unexpected turns and the suspense lasts until the very last turn. Be the first to clear your hand by creating the right pattern on the board and you&rsquo;re the winner. Easy, right? However, be aware your opponents all have the same goal.&#10;&#10;QUARTINO rewards forward thinking, spatial awareness, and sustained focus. However, there is just enough oportunities to allow for unexpected twists and keep players on their toes!&#10; Design of the game is very elegant and the game uses only natural materials. The game revolves around a laser-cut wooden board, complemented with wooden stands and wooden stones of four different colors. The game also contains 24 QUARTINO cards, each with a unique combination of four colors.&#10;&#10;Awards &amp; Honors&#10;2021 IG Players Choice Award&#10;2022 &Eacute;ducaFLIP Nomin&eacute;&#10;&#10;How to play QUARTINO? &#10;Each player draws four QUARTINO cards and places them secretly in his card stand. Each card contains a unique combination of four colors. Players take turns, and in each turn they place one stone of their choice on the game board. They try to complete one of their QUARTINO cards, i.e. create a color combination matching one of their cards. Game stones can be placed on top of each other. For the completion of QUARTINO, only the top stones count.&#10;If a player completes a QUARTINO on the game board, he shows the card and removes all stones from the QUARTINO from the game board. Then she plays again, i.e. places a new stone.&#10;Whoever completes all his QUARTINO cards first, wins the game.&#10;Before each player&acute;s turn, two special rules can come to play:&#10;If there are 4 or more stones of the same color on the board (all stones, not just top stones), the player can say &ldquo;color&rdquo; and place an additional stone.&#10;if there are 4 or more stones of any color on top of each other on the board, the player needs to remove all the stones in such columns. The player can then place an additional stone.&#10;&#10;QUARTINO - theory of game &#10;Rules for QUARTINO game you can find in the box, but here you can find some tips how to play successfully.&#10;&#10;Of course, you can play randomly without much thought and analysis, which we recommend especially when you play with children or when play 3 or more players. However, there are 5 basic tips for a more successful and interesting game for two players game.&#10;&#10;1) First look closely at all 24 cards in the game. You will find that some of them can have up to 3 positions in the same color combinations. Imagine a order of place stones so that your opponent does not have a chance to make a combination from another card after your turn.&#10;2) Imagine before your turn whether your opponent could make a combination after place your stone. You don't have to count the combination you have and the ones your opponent has already created and placed on table.&#10;3) Before first turn: Look closely on cards you have and try to find pair with some common color combination. This can help you to win one of them easily.&#10;4) If you place first stone, try to make rule &quot;Column&quot;(4 stones in one column) as fast as possible, but only in situation, when opponent don't have chance to make combination. It will help you to avoid situation when is on board 12 stones (3 pieces from each color) and you have to place 4. stone from some color. &#10;5) Try to remember stone colors and their positions your opponent try to place. You can learn from this his card combinations.&#10;&#10;Lot of those tips use players at QUARTINO tournaments. Game is a bit longer then, but you can use e.g. chess clock to limit time for one game.&#10;&#10;",
