    "description": "Insidious Sevens is a trick-taking game in which players predict how many tricks they will win each round. The deck consists of 40 cards, numbered 0-7 in five colors, with the colors ranked on the cards: purple (high), blue, green, yellow, red (low). Note that all 7s are higher than any 6, which are each higher than any 5, and so on.&#10;&#10;At the start of a round, each player is dealt seven cards. Players pass 0-3 cards to their left or right neighbor depending on the round number. Players then predict the number of tricks they'll take by choosing a card in their hand and simultaneously revealing them. The player with the highest bid becomes start player for the round, and the color of that player's card indicates the trump suit for that round. These bidding cards are then returned to the players' hands.&#10;&#10;The start player for a trick lays down a card, and each player must follow the lead by playing a card of the same color or number. If this isn't possible, they can play any card. The highest trump card played (if any) wins the trick; otherwise the highest card played that followed the lead (including number!) wins the trick. After seven tricks, the round ends. Making one's bid nets two points plus the number of tricks bid, while missing results in a loss of one point for every under- or over-trick. The player with the highest score after seven rounds wins.&#10;&#10;An optional rule forbids the bids from summing to seven. If this occurs, the player with the highest bid scores one point, then the bid cards are set aside and players rebid from the cards remaining in hand. This process can repeat until the total of bids made does not equal seven.&#10;&#10;",

Strength is for attacks, Cunning for theft and corruption, both for escaping and recruiting Gangsters. Commit crimes and succeed at the above to raise your Reputation and gain ranks and perks. But fail, then lose REP!&#10;&#10;Each day in prison has 5 rounds. A Convict has 5 Actions to spend per round. Rounds are dynamic: Guards change position after a dice-roll, altering options, Contraband is distributed in cells and Events come into play. Then, lockdown for the night. All in cell! Gain REP from recruited Gangsters still alive, lose REP or not fighting rivals that taunted you with Bitch coins. Then choose how to upgrade your convict with a read and/or workout. A new day begins!&#10;&#10;On your turn, pick from your Cell Stash what Contraband your Convict pockets as hidden Carry Items. Then, move him from his cell passed Gangster filled cellblocks, prowling rivals and guarded rooms, while managing spent Actions. Choose to spend more Actions by upgrading your Convict&rsquo;s Strength or Cunning with a workout in the Courtyard, game of chess and more.

Keep traded items hidden and your rivals guessing. Is it a toothbrush shank, an Escape tool...Need to attack or steal to find out! Planning a breakout? Get the Tools matching your Escape Card then secure them. Added to your Strength and Cunning, they improve your odds.&#10;&#10;Preyed upon? End your turn next to a Guard for protection, and pray he won&rsquo;t move. Or better! Corrupt a Guard aided by Contraband bribes like booze, pills and porn. Owning Guards grants you access to restricted areas and no-cost Actions while leaving rivals unprotected. Take control of the board!&#10;&#10;The more the bloodier! In advanced mode, hire skill-specific Gangsters to do your dirty work, break bones in riots, steal or gang up on rivals. These Thieves, Brawlers, Pushers and Hookers will pimp up your Reputation too. So use them to complete Crime Assignments such as Fight Clubs, Cartels, Bordellos etc. It will boost your rank in the race to be crowned KING.&#10;  &#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Hull Breach: Loyalty and Vigilance is a stand-alone expansion to Hull Breach: The Corporate Wars. Introducing the Republic Defense Force, Loyalty and Vigilance can be played on its own, against the Corps from The Corporate Wars, or mix-and-match the cards to build your own customized deck!&#10;&#10;Each player has his or her own deck of cards consisting of a Station, ships, modules, Marines, technological breakthroughs, events, and tactics. Players compete head-to-head to destroy each other's fleets and space station; the last player or team standing is the victor.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;&#10;Players choose from a variety of pre-constructed decks or can assemble their own, then each player takes turns either building up their base or building ships to attack their opponents. First player to destroy (or take over from boarding action) is the winner.&#10;&#10;Each faction/deck has a unique power and varied amounts of resources generated each turn. With these resources you can add on modules to your base, or play ships/marines to the table. Your base functions as a mothership where your subsequent ships make up the fleet you will use for offense and defense. Each turn you will get more resources based on your base and the modules attached (which can add to your resource generation).&#10;&#10;The ships and marines have different special abilities such as stealth (to avoid enemy detection). Some ships can even retrieve more ships from your deck at no cost.&#10;&#10;Combat is resolved with d10s. You count up the total amount your roll for offense (based on the current stats of the cards involved) then roll. The target roll is determined by the defense of the ship. Most small ships can only take 1 or 2 hits, but larger ships will need multiple hits to take down. Wounds do carry over but there are mechanisms to remove some wound tokens over time.&#10;&#10;Second Edition Updated Rules&#10;&#10;Stackable Traits are no more! &#10;To reduce the amount of math that HB Commanders have to do in combat, traits that granted a +X ability are being retooled. Values are now only the printed numbers, and do not increase with any +X effects.&#10;&#10;Trait-or-Fire!&#10;Use your weapons or a trait. That's one of the simplest rules in Hull Breach! It also now applies to stations as well &ndash; no more Target Painting for 4 and shooting 6 at the same target with your station. Stations should have advantages but testing reveals that certain station builds were becoming pwnmobiles, capable of ripping apart attacking fleets.&#10;&#10;Spicing Up Events!&#10;The tried-and-true Event cards now have two possible outcomes: a Critical outcome and a Nominal outcome. When you deploy the card, you make a D10 die roll to determine what you'll get. A roll of a 1 or a 10 is a Critical outcome, and is in some cases a more powerful result, and sometimes a bad result for the person wielding the card. Any other roll result is a Nominal outcome, which results in the 'usual' outcome for that card.&#10;&#10;Faction-Only Cards!&#10;Some cards, specifically some Marines, Upgrades and Events, are now marked as Faction-Only, meaning that only the faction printed on the card gets to use them. This has been done in an attempt to work a little more story flavor into the game. For example, Special Operations Groups represent the RDF Marine Corps' elite troops and are no longer available to non-RDF players. As compensation, Corporate Commanders can now field their own elite Marines known as Direct Assault Response Teams (DART).&#10;&#10;Module Overhaul!&#10;There have been significant changes in the world of Modules. In HB Alpha, Modules were further divided into Module-Ship, Module-Station, and Module-Marine cards. No longer! They've been broken into more obviously different types depending on what they attach to, and we've made a more clearer distinction of size on ships, Stations, and Modules. One of the new things we can do is attach multiple mods to ships, and Stations are a little more narrowly restricted to what they can or can't attach, depending on what the purpose of the station is (military versus economy).&#10;&#10;Say Goodbye to Characters!&#10;Character cards were a neat idea. Unfortunately they proved to be too frequently used as the basis for an entire deck strategy. So, they're all dead. Most, however, have been reborn as Add Personnel cards that can be attached to Marines and do something cool for your local units. The tradeoff is that they're no longer independent units that can board ships or stations and fire back at you, and they're nowhere near as powerful as they once were.&#10;&#10;First-Turn Facefisting is Ancient History!&#10;We have implemented a couple of new mechanics at game start that will alleviate most first-turn knockouts. We've achieved this by revising the initiative rules for the starting phase of the game: the Commander with the smallest fleet and Station size (printed on the card, and mentioned above), begins play after the Setup Phase. So, if you deploy fewer or smaller ships than your adversary, you take the first in-sequence turn of the game rather than leave it to a die roll for initiative.&#10;&#10;New Combat Mechanics!&#10;&#10;Initiative in Engagements&#10;Now controlled by unit size and progresses from the smallest ships up to the largest. The heavies are much slower and more cumbersome than your Fighters and Frigates, so they take longer to get into firing position.&#10;&#10;Attacker and Defender&#10;Volley fire at each other in turn, in order of smallest to largest, with the exception of the defending Station getting first shot. So: Defender station, then attacker's fighters, defender's fighters, attacker's Frigates, etc, all the way up to Capital Ships.&#10;&#10;New Skirmish Phase&#10;The Interceptor Phase has been replaced by Skirmish. Any ships with the trait Interceptor (defending) or Raider (attacking) get to jump to the head of the attack order line, for the first turn only. No more extra turns for defenders!&#10;&#10;Boarding Actions&#10;Just like volley fire, boarding actions (now part of the Maneuver Phase) adhere to initiative rules: smaller ships act first, reflecting the idea that faster and more maneuverable craft have the advantage in landing Marines on-target. Boards are not declared until the start of the Maneuver Phase, and once they're all declared, Escort effects are applied and then they're resolved in ascending size order. You can now only declare a board on a ship of equal class size or larger.&#10;&#10;Combat is resolved with d10s. You count up the total amount your roll for offense (based on the current stats of the cards involved) then roll. The target roll is determined by the defense of the ship. Most small ships can only take 1 or 2 hits, but larger ships will need multiple hits to take down. Wounds do carry over but there are mechanisms to remove some wound tokens over time.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Set loosely in 17th century during the time of the great Spanish treasure fleets. Twenty ships loaded with treasure are ready to sail for Spain. However, there are bloodthirsty pirates waiting to plunder the ships. The Governor has decided to send the ships out in small groups hoping they can make it past the pirates undetected. However, the pirates have lookouts keeping a vigilant watch on the harbor.&#10;&#10;The game components consists of: one (1) lookout card, one (1) governor card, thirty (30) treasure fleet ship cards (valued from 6-22), two (2) cursed ships, sixty (60) cannon cards (12 for each player) valued from one to four, five (5) storm cards (1 for each player), five (5) boarding party cards and five (5) pirate captain cards.&#10;&#10;The standard game is played in four rounds, called sailings. Each sailing consists of three volleys. Before each sailing four ships are drawn from the &quot;Treasure Fleet&quot; stack, and placed face up on the table. (In a five player game the game lasts for five rounds and five ships are drawn.) Each player chooses three cards from their hand to commit to fire on any of the four ships. The player(s) not directly to the right or the left of the lookout get to commit four cards but can only play three of the four during that sailing. Special cards such as the Boarding Party (a kind of trump) and the Storm (a kind of &quot;negation&quot; play) can selected as well as cannon fire cards.&#10;&#10;After each volley the lookout passes clockwise to the next player. After three volleys the pirate captain with the most cannon fire on a ship wins that ship and its treasure points. Ships with tied cannon fire escape during the volley as well as ships not fired upon.&#10;&#10;After the final such sailing the governor is captured and ransomed, by the player with the highest valued card left in their hand. The winner is the pirate captain with the highest total treasure points.&#10;&#10;Microbadge&#10;&#10; Buy It&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Vikingjarl is a fun and exciting strategic board game about Vikings and Norse mythology from the Viking age set in the time period of 793-1066 AD. As a player, you begin the game as one of four Jarls (Jarl (Earl) &ldquo;free person of noble family and high birth&rdquo;), with the goal of becoming the next Ruler of Kaupang, ensuring power and prestige for you and your descendants. You accomplish this by pillaging, trading, establishing settlements, fighting, and outmaneuvering the other Jarls. Through strategic card play and dice rolls, the Jarls battle each other across the game board. You must make strategic decisions and carefully manage your resources in order to have the best chance to win. If you play well and receive some favor from the gods, perhaps you will become the next Vikingjarl!&#10;&#10;The game is turn-based and the Jarls each take turns moving their Ship and Army around the game board using Pawns, Dice, and Playing Cards. To obtain the Victory Points (VP) needed to win the game, you have to pillage, trade, settle and fight against the other Jarls. The main goal of the game is to reach a certain number of VP. The game is designed for 2-4 players, and is suitable for everybody form age 12 and up. &#10;An average round will take about 60 minutes. Includes over 260 playing pieces and cards.&#10;&#10;Storyline: It is the age of Conquering, Pillage, and Trade. Ragnar Ironhand, the King of Kaupang grows old and is looking for his most suitable successor. Ragnar gathers his four children and challenges them to leave Kaupang in search of fame and fortune in foreign lands. Whoever returns home as the most prosperous sibling, will lay claim to the throne. Gather your Viking warriors and set sail, but beware the whims of the fickle Norse gods as well as of your backstabbing and ambitious siblings, who are all vying to claim the throne for themselves.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "&quot;What is an implement of war is purely a matter of perspective. Even a blade of grass can turn the tide of battle.&quot; &mdash; Fiyreksis, Supreme Commander of the Flaym 5th, circa 403&#10;&#10;Design the battlefield, design your army, design your tactics, design your own path to victory in this sandbox fantasy warfare game.&#10;&#10;Background&#10;&#10;Long since the vanishing of the Greater Dragons, the War of Eternity has raged. Lacking the guidance of their benevolent creators, the kingdoms of Soroyland are fretted with social, political, and personal dissonance, fueling the flames of conflict. While The War has sundered the peoples, battles have never been without provocation by something greater than hubris, greater than good versus evil. Loved ones lost, ecosystems fractured, communities divided&mdash;it is what pangs the heart that drives the kingdoms into turmoil. Who is right and who is wrong in these conflicts? Who is the &ldquo;good guy&rdquo; and who is the &ldquo;bad guy&rdquo;? The answers to these questions depend upon perspective. Reasons for war are complicated webs of causes and effects, indiscernible by those detached from the source.&#10;&#10;With one conflict being catalyst to another, like dominoes in an infinite spiral, the peoples of the kingdoms are necessarily reared for war. For hundreds of years, wise leaders have dedicated their life to the evolution of warfare, honing the craft like master blacksmiths. The studies and teachings of these leaders serve as the groundwork for the Warline game design&mdash;which offers you a rich and flexible warfare tool set. With these tools, you are free to explore all angles of warfare. In your exploration, you are going to experience conflict in a manner that you likely have not before.&#10;&#10;Your keys to success are not a race to build power and crush your opponent. Instead, you will prevail by craft and ingenuity. You will outpace and overcome your opponent by means of shock, disruption, and deception. You will make sacrifices to gain every edge. As with the great historical commanders at the Frozen Coast, the Channels of Opulence, and the Flooded Cove, you will lead one of Soroyland&rsquo;s many kingdoms, and wield the multitude of tools at hand to design your own unique and memorable path to victory.&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;&#10;Warline: Maneuver Strategy &amp; Tactics is a detailed maneuver warfare sandbox game in which you craft and execute a unique strategy every time you play. Every battle begins with interactive &quot;Strategicraft&quot; decisions, where you design a unique strategy by your choice of terrain, fortifications, army composition, deployment, and more. Then, in battle, do you prefer to manipulate your opponent with psychological warfare? Are you more comfortable dominating your opponent with attrition? Would you be more effective by cutting off your opponent's center of gravity? Warline is a canvas on which you can paint tactics of your own creation.&#10;&#10;On the battlefield, invent complex, high impact chains of actions and combos to overcome every challenge your opponent throws at you. Warline gameplay is fluid, flexible, and mapped to a decision space that is infinitely broad and deep&mdash;ensuring that situational memorization is not only ineffective, it is nearly impossible. Every battle, and every moment of battle, must be approached in a unique manner. Every opponent that you face, regardless of skill level, presents a one-of-a-kind, interesting challenge.&#10;&#10;History Meets Fantasy&#10;&#10;The core of Warline's game design is founded on historical military doctrine, but it is the layers of rich fantasy and lore that help sculpt a vision of war that is even more thrilling and epic. Ride terrifying beasts in order to put immense pressure on your opponent. Wield powerful magic to not only manipulate the battle, but also to completely reshape the battlefield itself&mdash;transforming the landscape to your tactical advantage.&#10;&#10;Standout Features&#10;&#10;&bull; Uncountable paths to victory and the Strategicraft system ensure no two battles are alike.&#10;&bull; No-luck combat and action resolution ensure your wits and creativity alone are what propel you to victory.&#10;&bull; Core gameplay founded on designing complex, high impact action chains and combos.&#10;&bull; Terrifying powers that can transform the battlefield and weaponize even terrain.&#10;&bull; Three unique modes of play: Battle Canvas (freeform sandbox play), History of Conflict (scenarios rich in lore), and Mastery of Command (tactical puzzles).&#10;&bull; Warline encourages creative, fluid approaches to every situation, as your tactical decisions are not limited by rigid patterns.&#10;&bull; Incredibly short set up time, along with average match times of 45 minutes.&#10;&bull; Beautiful, large scale game components that appear as works of modern European industrial design, delivering a stunning table presence.&#10;&bull; Innovative game mechanisms that express vivid warfare while minimizing fiddliness and complication.&#10;&bull; Full support for deep and varied organized play.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The operation was a combined naval-air-land campaign in which all elements of military power were utilized. The historical campaign saw a German victory, but at the cost of much of the Kreigsmarine. Norway, 1940&rsquo;s game system is based on S&amp;T's award winning &quot;Red Dragon Rising&quot; system. It has been crafted to present the campaign as a unitary vision rather than a strictly sequenced process. The Action can alternately telescope or expand, representing periods of rapid activity alternating with the slower process of building up forces.&#10; Most ground units represent either brigades or regiments. Aircraft units represent Luftwaffe &ldquo;Gruppen&ldquo;, or groups of three Allied Squadrons (i.e., 36-60 aircraft). Ship units mostly represent one fleet aircraft carrier, divisions of two battleships, or four cruisers, squadrons/flotillas of about six-twelve destroyers, or various numbers of other ships types. &#10;Each game turn represents one half-week of operations.&#10;&#10;",

Also, randomly take a potion and a super item. These 3 cards will be your initial game engine.&#10;The game is divided into turns, each player starts their turn by drawing a card from the deck. Then you can perform a series of actions in the order you want without repeating.&#10;&#10;     Hoard: Play a Tartapie from your hand.&#10;     Equip: Play an attack, defense or relic item.&#10;     Play your skills (Talent and Mastery).&#10;     Play your super item.&#10;     Play a Faction.&#10;&#10;&#10;Many of these actions are played as a &quot;reaction&quot; to what another player plays, so it will be possible for you to perform actions outside of your turn, all in order to ruin the game of other players.&#10;The game ends when you can no longer draw any cards at the beginning of the turn. If at that moment you are the one who manages to collect (or not lose) the most Tartapies, you will be the winner.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;Aventura, magia y traici&oacute;n...

Additionally, players will need a pawn and a common supply of about 30 markers in each of four different colors. The cards form a timeline, allowing players to move back and forth through history to find cheap commodities and then sell for profit.  Of course, all this time travel will shift the timeline, and thus the market for each of the four commodities.&#10;&#10;The cards have four pathways from the left to right sides, which cross over each other. They also have a waypoint representing one of the commodities (sheep, neckties, Picassos ... just suggestions from the designer, as they are all pretty abstract!) that can be picked up cheaply at that point in time.&#10;&#10;The object is to score 21 points by picking up commodities and selling them at points in the timeline where they are worth obscene amounts of money. However, picking up a commodity changes the timeline in subtle ways: in the game, it means moving a card up or down by a slight amount, which disconnects its current pathways and connects them to new pathways.&#10;&#10;",

The game uses 2 22x34 inch maps with 200 yards to the hex along with 940 counters representing individual regiments and artillery batteries along with all the leaders down to the divisional level.  The map covers quite a bit of the area around Gettysburg giving players plenty of room to maneuver.  While the game is at nearly the same level as SPI&rsquo;s Terrible Swift Sword: Battle of Gettysburg Game, it does move more quickly due to somewhat more streamlined rules as well as an initiative system that randomizes who&rsquo;s going to move next and how long a turn will last.  There is even a random events chart that occasional allows a player to move and enemy unit or launch a free counter-attack.&#10;&#10;From the rulebook:&#10;&#10;&ldquo;The sequence of play is move-and-shoot, but initiative rules and a variable number of turns per day keep both players guessing.  The initiative rules help him who helps himself; once you gain an advantage, it&rsquo;s in your best interest to keep the pressure on.  Combat stresses unit morale, but can turn bloody if both units stand and fight.  All-out charges can clear ground fast, but at the cost of much higher casualties.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;&#10;",

In SYNOD, which consists of only eighteen cards (15 Noble cards and 3 Favor/Synod cards), each player vies for control of the Synod of GearSeed. Using Noble cards belonging to the three Castes of GearSeed (Coalkin, Thorned, and Gremlin), players assert their influence in the Synod.&#10;&#10;Noble cards can be played either face up or face down. When played face up, Noble cards grant the player a special ability, influence, and the possibility of granting the favor of their Caste to the player. Face down cards are revealed at the end of the game and grant influence and are worth points if the requirements of their schemes are met.&#10;&#10;With simple mechanisms, engaging gameplay, a limited card pool, and meaningful choices, it's not about the cards you draw; it's how and when you play them.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "A new collectible card game brought to us from BANDAI JAP. English version distributed by BANDAI AMERICA. The game is anime stylized but is not based on an anime (until later versions) it was created by Michael Elliott, game designer for MTG, and also creator of Duel Masters.&#10;&#10;There are six different categories of cards. Each represented by a different Gem stone. Ruby, Diamond, Amethyst, Sapphire, Topaz, and Emerald. Each gem set possesses specific powers, abilities, and types of spirits which are unique to each gem set.&#10;&#10;The game is based around a &quot;core&quot; concept. Each player begins with 5 life which is represented by gems included with the game; also players begin with 4 &quot;core&quot; in their reserve that are also represented by the same gems used to indicate your life total. The goal of the game is to reduce your opponents life to zero, or through &quot;crushing&quot; your opponents deck so they can no longer draw any cards.&#10;&#10;As players receive damage from their opponents actions their life transfers from your life area to your reserve where you can pay for spirits, spells, and nexus's essentially adding a balance to the game; so that even though you may be on the receiving end of an assault you are gaining the ability to respond with a counter attack. Your reserve refreshes at the beginning of every turn with each core you had spent on the previous turn and you gain 1 additional core every turn.&#10;&#10;The game at its base is very simplistic, but as you play in more advanced degrees it tends to have a &quot;poker&quot; feel to it, as you can bluff and certain plays give away &quot;tells&quot; and whatnot, it takes about 45 minutes to play a match (best 2 of 3 games)&#10;&#10;Although the game requires basic strategy, there is a lot of involvement in the deck building process, because your resources are on a differing track from your deck there is no mulligan, such as in MTG, however you only begin with 4 core in reserve so you want to include spirits and cards in your deck that work with your &quot;core&quot; production curve. This concept makes a large portion of the spirits and spells in the game to be very attractive to deck building which makes individual cards very cost effective.&#10;&#10;Battle Spirits is currently on it's 4th edition with the 5th set releasing Sept. 10th. It is relatively unknown because it is only distributed to local hobby retailers and online hobby stores. It is currently unknown when the game will hit the mass market, but is expected to gain high popularity with the younger crowd as the anime will be hitting US airways hopefully in the spring of 2011.&#10;&#10;BANDAI AMERICA will send you a free demo deck (all constructed with cards from the first set) they are white backed which indicates they are not approved for sanctioned tournament play, however they are adequate for casual gaming and can give you a good taste of the game mechanics.&#10;&#10;For more information please see Bandaicg.com/battlespirits regarding how to play, how to obtain your free demo deck, you can also watch videos on YouTube by searching for &quot;Bandai CG&quot;.&#10;&#10;On behalf of the Battle Spirits community, I warmly welcome you to the game! &#10;-Brandon Anderson (Top 8 X-championship GenCon 2010)&#10;&#10;",

How this works is that the clue givers have a device that shows a list of clues. Each turn, one clue giver chooses one of the listed clues, presents it to the opposing guesser, and hopes that he presented it with the wrong intonation so that the guesser won't guess the secret code word. As the crummy clues are used up, the clues will get better and better, so your challenge as the clue giver is to quickly figure out what might give a hint to your partner without giving the thing away entirely &ndash; which again is pretty much like Password!&#10;&#10;",

The game includes components for a two-player game; by combining two sets, up to four players can compete.&#10;&#10;Units are represented by cards, with each card depicting the forces in it with color-coded symbols across its top. The forces come in five strengths, which from weakest to strongest are Lance, Bow, Sword, Helmet and Banner. For example, a unit (card) with Sword and Helmet will have across the top: blank, blank, green, yellow, blank. Each player starts with a hand of five cards and a location card on the table depicting five territories, which is where a player lays his cards.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player draws a card from the deck, then lays one card from his hand into one of the territories next to his location card. Each territory can have no more than four cards in it. Once you've played four cards into a territory, you've determined the final strength of the army there. If the same symbol is on all four cards, you've created a Regiment; the same symbol on only three cards creates a Battalion, and the same symbol on only two cards creates a Company. (You can create multiple Regiments, Battalions and Companies in the same territory.)&#10;&#10;To determine who wins the battle in a territory, compare each player's army in this territory. The player whose army has the most Regiments wins; if players are tied for the number of Regiments, then the player with the strongest Regiments wins; if players have equally strong Regiments, then the player with the most Battalions wins; and so on. Even if his opponent(s) have not completed their armies, a player can win a territory by proving that it's impossible for someone to create a stronger army in the same territory.&#10;&#10;When a player wins a territory, he places a lowest available victory marker on this army. Once all five victory markers have been claimed, the game ends. The player who collects the most markers wins; if players are tied for the number of victory markers, then the player whose markers have the lowest sum wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Decision: Iraq is a game that emphasizes the fight against the insurgency in Iraq, which began in 2003 following the US-led invasion of that country. Historically, the quick US-Coalition victory over Saddam Hussein&rsquo;s military forces in March of that year quickly degenerated into an insurgency that swept the country. The situation was eventually turned around, but only after a steep learning curve for the United States and its partners. The game shows some of the major factors involved. &#10; There are two players in the game: The Insurgents (who want to seize control of Iraq. These represent various Iraqi Rebels and Foreign Fighters, the latter including Al Qaeda and Iranian support, among others), and the Counterinsurgents (who want to restore stability to a democratic Iraq, as well as defeat any Al Qaeda elements which may be operating in the country.) These represent Multinational (MNF) forces (US and allies) and Iraqi Government Forces (which also include friendly Iraqi tribal militias).&#10; Both players have a set of pieces that represent conventional and unconventional forces. During their respective turns, players move their pieces amongst the spaces on the map, and engage in various kinds of conflict in order to destroy enemy forces. The objective for each player is to establish control over Iraq.&#10; One unique feature of the game is that units&rsquo;, as they engage in combat, effectiveness may increase or decrease as they gain experience in fighting, or become demoralized.&#10; The game includes one map (22x34&rdquo;) and 228 counters.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "3 Man Chess is played &ldquo;in the round,&rdquo; that is, the field of play is circular.  For the most part, 3 Man Chess is played just like conventional Chess. &ndash; there was NEVER any intention of trying to make the game &ldquo;better&rdquo; because that can&rsquo;t be done. However, being able to play with three minds interacting creates situations that never arise in conventional Chess.&#10;&#10;&#10;     3 Man Chess&rsquo; circular game board consists of 6 concentric ranks of 24 files and an open central &ldquo;void&rdquo; that pieces may pass, but not stop on. There are teardrop shaped curves drawn on the board to help diagonal moves navigate the &ldquo;void.&rdquo;&#10;     3 Man Chess uses conventional chess teams (three of them!) &ndash; 16 pieces that follow all of their traditional rules; 8 pawns start on rank #2 protecting 2 rooks, 2 knights, 2 bishops, a queen and a king which start on rank #1 (the outermost rank).&#10;     The teams are separated from each other by &ldquo;moats&rdquo; and &ldquo;creeks&rdquo; that are impassable at the start of the game.&#10;     Diagonal moves follow the drawn guidelines, passing across the center to the opposite &ldquo;spoke.&rdquo;&#10;     Straight moves may also pass across the central &ldquo;void,&rdquo; or move around the circular ranks.&#10;     After just a couple of turns around the board, strategy becomes intensely complex and fascinating! An unexpected move might well result in a cascading massacre. Defense is crucial since a diagonal move through the center, or a horizontal move around the center can sneak up behind you. Your two opponents can team up to checkmate you, or ultimately you can checkmate both of them at the same time!&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

You are one of the few brave enough to venture into this exciting but dangerous new land to research and record new species. The world watches to see the discoveries that will be uncovered. The media has dubbed you and your comrades &quot;The Darwinauts&quot; for daring to go beyond to record the new origins of species. You must work quickly to bring back records of the most exotic lifeforms to secure your place in history, but be careful, the portal is unstable and won't remain open for long... The Rift is coming!&#10;&#10;During the course of Darwinauts, a player takes two actions on their turn, selecting from five possible actions: place an explorer, place a tile, replenish tiles and remove explorers, discover a species, and record a species. When recording a species, a player immediately takes one of five possible bonus actions that allow the player to set themselves up for future turns or alter the landscape. Players continue to take turns until The Rift tile is revealed, making the portal to the new world unstable. Once The Rift begins, players add an additional phase to their turns, taking part in dismantling the landscape they have opened up for exploration. The game comes to a close as they race to complete their tasks and return home. When the game ends, players receive prestige points for their recorded species and bonuses are earned for specializing in specific sets of species. The Darwinaut with the most points wins the game and goes down in history as a pioneer in this new age of discovery.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

Well, they're rumored to be the owner's nephew, so you'd better not bother them. Well, unless they're the spy next door.&#10;&#10;Trick Dumpling differs from the usual trick-taking game in that the highest numbered cards are discarded when the total of the numbers in each suit exceeds a certain number. The reason for this is that the steamer is very small and can only hold up to 10 dumplings, as the restaurant has saved on capital expenditure.&#10;&#10;(maximum) 10 dumplings per dish!&#10;Compete with other cooks to complete the perfect dish of dumplings by reading the dynamically changing strength of the cards.

The game is heavily inspired by Gunrunners, an earlier game by the same designer and publisher.&#10;&#10;The game is played over a series of rounds. In each round, players simultaneously choose an agent card to play from their hand and a location to play it.  In turn order, players then deploy their agents as moles (face-down) to the chosen locations. If a mole is already at a location, that mole is revealed and is now a &quot;field agent&quot;.  Sometimes, when a mole is revealed, a special power will be performed by the owning player of the mole (some agent cards have powers).  These special powers change from game to game for variety of play (based on the City Card being used for the game). They do such things as forcing criminals to move, redeploying agents to new locations, making small arrests, and so on.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, each location is scored and players arrest criminals based on their agent powers at each location.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Apex Legends: The Board Game is a highly competitive, intensely tactical team vs. team miniatures game for 2-6 players. Each playthrough takes about 60-90 minutes, depending on the number of players and selected game features. Utilizing an original engine and innovative framework, the game authentically captures the voice and imagination of the Apex Legends video game, successfully bringing the stakes, thrills, and kills of the battle royale experience to life.&#10;&#10;Taking place on the Kings Canyon map, the core experience focuses on the final zone, where the ultimate confrontation unfolds. Each player assumes the role of a unique Legend. The players activate team by team, trying to outmaneuver enemies in the heat of battle and recreate the unpredictable, unforgettable moments known from the source game&mdash;securing key positions on the map, snatching valuable loot seconds before an opponent, or diving behind cover or shielding a teammate just in time to save them from oblivion...&#10;&#10;Once activated, each Legend may perform basic actions such as Move, Interact, Use, and Attack. Additionally, the players can utilize their Legend's unique Abilities (both combat-oriented and utility-based) and a deck of Legend-specific Feat cards to gain the upper hand. Creating a well-built team where Legends complement one another on the battlefield as well as using all available strategic options is the key to victory.&#10;&#10;After a team&rsquo;s activation is complete, the game is far from over! On their opponent's turn, Legends can react to enemy actions with Instant and Reaction cards. Reactions allow a player to respond when either they or their teammates are attacked, taking cover, recovering their shield, or assisting an ally. When the conditions on an Instant card are met, the player can activate it as a clever way to thwart their opponent's next move.&#10;&#10;Every choice, every move, and every piece of ammo matters!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The game deck contains 6 monsters of each species with values from 1 to 6. The game deck is shuffled and each player begins the game with a hand of monsters (of his/her assigned species or not!). In each turn a player must place a monster card in an empty space adjacent to a card already on the table. The monster that has come into play is known as the Protagonist Monster. The Protagonist Monster ALWAYS interacts with orthogonally adjacent monsters (not diagonally) with values of EXACTLY 1 POINT LESS. The Protagonist Monster interacts in the following way:&#10;&#10;with a monster of a DIFFERENT SPECIES, the Protagonist Monster moves in front of it (place card on top), stealing the close-up shot.&#10;&#10;with a monster of the SAME SPECIES, the monster is eclipsed by the impeccable performance of the Protagonist Monster and moves behind it (place card/s under it) dragging with it any cards it may have under.&#10;&#10;To win the game your monsters must receive the most close-up shots in the scenes of MONSTArgh!, so keep your monsters in the foreground and eclipse your rivals'.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

But if the card falls in the water (anything besides the top of the iceberg is considered the water) or pushes any other card into the water, that player must collect all of the fallen cards and place them in their own hand!&#10;&#10;Some cards contain special Powers that activate once they land on the iceberg. For example, once the bear has landed on the iceberg, it has the ability to eat the first card that lands directly above. This action forces the player who threw the card, the card that landed on top of the bear, to take a new card from the central deck into their own hand. Another animal with a special power is the seal, which has the ability to remain in the water when falling from the iceberg rather than going back into the player&rsquo;s hand. &#10;The first player with no remaining cards in their hand, wins the game!&#10;&#10;",

This goes on until all the pieces of cake are scored and the player with the most candles wins!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

During the game, the DSE Player tries to erode the power of the Greek authorities and replace their governing structures with his own, while the Government player tries to contain this threat to civil society with civilian police and the servicemen and reservists of the Greek National Army (GNA).&#10;&#10;Central to play of the game is the Political Index (PI). Both players maintain each maintain their own PI during the game. A player&rsquo;s PI is a quantification of the level of support or commitment the Greek &ldquo;man in the taverna&rdquo; is willing to give him (as opposed to other political movements or methods) as an agent of social change &ndash; or guarantor of security. For the Government player, his PI is also a measure of the stability of the political regime. PIs are measured in Political Points (PP) and recorded on the Record Track. PIs change constantly during the course of the game depending on events and who controls various territory. The highest level is 99, and the lowest is 0. If either player's PI reaches 0 at any point in the game, he is deemed to have reached the point of political collapse for his side, and the game ends.&#10;&#10;The game map shows mainland Greece, divided into Regions, and parts of the adjoining countries to the north (Albania, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria).&#10;&#10;Components: One 22&quot; x 34&quot; map &amp; 280 counters&#10;&#10;&#10;Published with Modern War #11 (March 2014).&#10;&#10;",

This task is complicated by limited air supply, hazards, and fierce competition from other divers.&#10;&#10;In the course of a turn, players balance using different air tanks to dive the ocean for treasure and return to the boat. The treasures are distributed in three depths, and their values are hidden underneath like the swimmers in the Survive! family of games. If a player fails to strike the correct balance to make it back to the boat, they will have to drop their treasure. Players can also use dolphins to either aid themselves or hinder other divers. A player must ask themselves if they will go for the deep chests and get left by the boat or if they will dive shallow and leave their buddies behind.&#10;&#10;Secrets of the Deep is a mix of light strategy and calculation, yet there is some random chance and the cards add a bit of suspense. Although the game is a bit luck based, the moving ship keeps the game short and adds a &ldquo;press-your-luck&rdquo; appeal, and there are opportunities for some good tactical moves in the midst of all the chaos.&#10;&#10;",
