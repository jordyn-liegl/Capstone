Now you, as the prosecution or defense, must convince a nine-panel jury that Mary Surratt, one of eight people put on trial for conspiring to assassinate President Abraham Lincoln and other members of his cabinet, is guilty...or innocent.&#10;&#10;Unforgiven: The Lincoln Assassination Trial is a two-player game that takes place during the May 9 - June 28, 1865 trial of the first woman, Mary Surratt, ever to be executed for treason by the United States. The game begins amidst the chaos of Lincoln's assassination as the country struggles to heal over the wreckage of the American Civil War. Each player must persuade the jury to convict or acquit the accused and thereby win the game. To do so, players draft and play cards that help them strengthen their case with the jurors and recruit them to their side, while also finding overwhelming evidence for or against the accused.&#10;&#10;In one of the most high-profile trials in U.S. history, will Mary Surratt again face the hangman's noose of American justice &mdash; or can you stop the trap door from falling?&#10;&#10;",

Each of the eight companies has 2-5 shares available, depending on the number of players, and each player starts with a randomly drawn share. At the start of the game, place six movement tiles (numbered 1-6) in one bag and six action tiles (trade x3, rank +1, rank -1, no action) in another bag.&#10;&#10;Each round, the starting player draws one tile from each bag. If he draws a rank +1 or rank -1, he moves one share price indicator (a.k.a. &quot;brick&quot;) of his choice up or down one rank on the movement track that organizes the company bricks. If he draws a trade, each player buys and/or sells one share to the bank. Players then simultaneously choose one of the two cards in their hand and reveal them. If no one played a bank holiday card, then in turn order, the brick associated with each company card advances on the movement track a number of spaces equal to the movement tile drawn, ignoring occupied spaces. The value of a company's shares depends on the location of its brick on the movement track and its position relative to all of the other bricks. If one or more bank holiday cards were played, the bricks move only half the distance or don't move at all.)&#10;&#10;Players each draw a new card, and the bags pass to the next player in clockwise order, who becomes the starting player for the next round. If a trade tile was drawn, return all tiles to their respective bags first. The rounds continue until one or more company bricks reach the end of the movement track. At the end of that round, players cash out their holdings and whoever has the most money wins.&#10;&#10;",

Train obsolescence is rapid and unforgiving, and it is quite possible for forced-purchase trains to be obsolete before they get a chance to run. Capitalization is on a per-share basis throughout the game and train prices are steep &gt;1400 for an 8 train - the largest.&#10;&#10;There are 8 historical corporations and eight, named but ahistorical &quot;generic&quot; corporations. These are normally used simply as investment vehicles to maximize the amount of capital available to &quot;successful&quot; companies close to Milan. Northern Italy is mountainous, especially near the off-board Alpine areas and to the South of the map, making progress slow and expensive for the outlying historical companies.&#10;&#10;1841 has a reputation as a very long game, but is not necessarily much longer than games, such as 1870, which have a very large bank. It can be completed in four hours.&#10;&#10;Chris Lawson's game kit is one version that is available and is of his usual high (for a game kit) quality. A large amount of time with scissors and craft knife to cut out the stock and tiles can be expected.  Deep Thought Games now publishes 1841v2 which incorporates changes by Manlio Manzini to address some of the perceived shortcomings with the original which was designed by Federico Vellani with Manlio as a co-author.&#10;&#10;Description by Steve Thomas:&#10;&#10;1841 is the 18xx game of choice for many players, though some hate it. Designed, and originally published as 1839 by Federico Vellani, it is set in northern Italy. The McGuffin here is that 1841 is the 18xx game which is least about actually building a railway and most about manipulating the stock market and managing the extremely fierce train obsolescence. Route development has its place, but unless the players can get the rest of the game about right they are doomed, and it is this which polarizes players' views of the game. When it first became available it whetted the slightly jaded palates of some players since the dividing line between success and abject failure is so narrow. 1841 achieves this by allowing companies to buy and sell shares in each other, and to merge with one another. These factors result in frequent and hard-to-predict changes to the order in which the companies operate. It's exciting and dynamic, and the only real downside, at least for &quot;the financiers who've had enough of the engineers&quot;, to misquote the 1853 box art, is the length of the game. At typically seven hours it cannot sensibly be played in an evening. Even so, the game is usually well worth the investment of time, though it's certainly not for the novice.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "18EU is an 18xx title which depicts a century of European railroading from the 1830s to the 1930s. It shares much in common with other 18xx titles, but also includes 15 minor companies. They are auctioned before the game starts, then pay 50/50 dividend (Minor/Owner) and finally merge to form corporations. Another special element are bonuses for completing long runs between off-map areas, that can affect huge incomes in the end game. The map stretches from France to Austria and Poland, and from northern Germany to middle Italy and features the Alps as mountains (higher tile laying costs). The game is played in sets of two operating rounds, where the railroads are built, followed by one stock round, where shares are bought and sold.&#10;&#10;The general idea of all 18xx titles is holding shares of railway companies, building railroads by laying hex-tiles, running trains and generating income paid out as dividend. The special thing (and difference to other games) is the difference between the players&acute; private money and the money in the companies&acute; treasuries. In the end the player, who managed to acquire the biggest private fortune, wins the game!&#10;&#10;",

Here you will be positioning your Courtiers among the influential Lords who grant you actions that allow you to maneuver your family members to high title offices and gain their respective Rings of prestige and power.&#10;&#10;Players take turns placing their Courtiers into the three Audience Chambers, each with unique actions. Then each player will place their one Lord in a Chamber of their choice. Only Courtiers in an Audience Chamber with any player's Lord present will be able to use that Chamber&rsquo;s actions. But be careful, since there are only a limited number of seats available in each Chamber and competing families can push you out of a Chamber!&#10;&#10;Then all player Courtiers, in Chambers with a Lord, take turns performing ONE of the two Actions in their Chambers. The powerful Lords may also take both actions in the Chamber they occupy. Chamber Actions allow you to gain Court Cards and to move your Courtiers in the Throne Room onto spaces with square Court Tokens that represent various faction interests and demands at the court. You collect these Court Tokens, which are one way to gain Prestige at court.&#10;&#10;When you reach the top space of a Court Office in the Royal Court, you will gain that title - represented by a Ring. A player's Rings are placed and displayed on their individual Player Hand Screens.

Goods cards come in six colors, and the more cards of a color on display, the more in demand that good is. Each player gets a hand of three goods cards and (on the table) two ship cards; in turn, each player places a goods cube of their choice on a ship, then they place a goods cube on their other ship.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you take two actions. The first action is one of these choices:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Exchange a goods cube on one of your ships with a cube of a different color, if available. (Each good has only five cubes.)&#10;     Buy a special card, which are explained below.&#10;     Pass.&#10;&#10;&#10;The second action is one of these choices:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Play goods cards of one color onto cards in the demand row, placing each card played onto a different spot in the demand row, covering the card already present; after you do this, each player with cubes of the color played receives 1 coin for each visible card of this color per cube on their ships. (For example, if red was played and you have two red cubes and three red cards show in the demand row, you gain 6 coins.)&#10;     Draw two goods cards from the deck.&#10;&#10;&#10;The special cards you can buy aren't worth money on their own, but they can help you earn more coins:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Ship (costs 10 coins): After buying the ship, place a goods cube from the reserve on it.&#10;     Office (8 coins): After your second action, draw a goods card from the deck; if you have three offices, draw three cards.&#10;     Docker (12 coins): If you exchange goods for your first action, you can exchange one extra goods cube per docker you have.&#10;     Trade agreement (11 coins): If you earn coins in any player's second action, gain 2 extra coins per trade agreement you have.&#10;&#10;&#10;When the goods deck runs out, the game ends immediately.

A construct of intrigue and secrets is knitted around a supposedly simple burglary. Be there live to support the Inspector a second time and catch those responsible in the act. Throw yourself headlong into an exciting crime case and find your way to the solution using multimedia. The village also has a few skeletons in its cupboard...&#10;&#10;One thing is clear: this calls for true pros. To find the culprit, you will need to examine all the documents carefully, study the fingerprints, check the alibis and do some research. A real detective will follow any scent to uncover the mystery. Can you think creatively enough? No limits are imposed on your creativity during your investigations.&#10;&#10;As a team, you will need to analyse letters, interpret the police interviews of various suspects, make telephone calls and even do some research on the Internet. Your approach to finding a solution is guaranteed to be multidimensional. Study the fingerprints, collect all the information on your large poster, discuss the alibis and motives. For your research during the investigation, you will need internet access and a phone with which you can receive text messages. It is also helpful (but not absolutely necessary) if you have a laptop or tablet at hand. Mobile phones are also allowed!&#10;&#10;You should allow approx. 1.5-3 hours for the murder mystery game. However, you can also put it aside one evening and continue the next day.&#10;You will all work together in a team, rather than playing against one another. The game is suitable for people aged 14 and over. It is too complex for a group of younger children. In a family, however, younger children can also make a contribution and assist with the detective work.&#10;&#10;Languages&#10;This game is available in:&#10;German: Das Diadem der Madonna&#10;British: The Midnight Crown &#10;American: The Midnight Crown&#10;French: Le Diad&egrave;me d&rsquo;Amaryllis&#10;Italian: Il Diadema di Mezzanotte&#10;Dutch: De Diadeem van de Madonna&#10;Spanish: La Diadema Escarlata&#10;&#10;Canadian: The Midnight Crown (coming soon)&#10;Australian: The Midnight Crown (coming soon)&#10;&#10;",

In the board game Opera, the players bring Opera to the public. In Venice, Vienna, Berlin, London, Paris and Milan great Opera houses arise. Opera leads the players through the periods of Baroque, Classicism and Romanticism. The epic music of six famous composers H&auml;ndel, Monteverdi, Mozart, Beethoven, Wagner and Verdi will bring the public to their Opera houses.&#10;&#10;Clever budgeting is essential to gain control and be the master of your own success. Each round the players determine their budget level to influence the order of play and to activate the characters in the game. The players build new Opera Houses, scout for new Operas of popular composers and try to earn some money. Sometimes they choose to cash in at the Palazzo where the Signora pays them well, but in the long term music are one of the key fundamentals to build your empire. The elegant Maestro brings the performance of an Opera to a higher level and the Critico can make or break a composer. Do not overvalue the three counting rounds with progressively growing value, because a well timed appearance of the Esperto might just bring you the victory in Opera. Ducats and capacity are key elements to facilitate the growth of your empire and influence, but in the end wealth is just an instrument to attain higher ends.&#10;&#10;In Opera the players must plan well. Introducing an Intermezzo from time to time might be helpful to seize the initiative on a decisive moment in the game. Opera takes place over 9 rounds of play, divided in 3 episodes. Each episode consists of three playing rounds and a counting round. The player with the highest number of victory points after the third and last counting round will be the victor.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "By design, Commands &amp; Colors Tricorne - The American Revolution is not overly complex. The game is based on the highly successful Commands &amp; Colors game system, where the Command cards drive movement while creating a &ldquo;fog of war&rdquo; and the battle dice resolve combat quickly and efficiently. Commands &amp; Colors Tricorne - The American Revolution, however, introduces many new game concepts, which will add historical depth and provide even the most veteran Commands &amp; Colors player many new play experiences and challenges.&#10;&#10;The scale of the game fluctuates, which allows players to effectively portray some of the larger American Revolution battles, as well as smaller size skirmish actions. In some scenarios, an infantry unit may represent an entire brigade, while in others a unit may only represent a few companies of soldiers. Still the linear tactics of the period, that you will need to execute to gain victory, conform remarkably well to the advantages and limitations inherent to the various American Revolution Armies of the day, and the battlefield terrain features on which they fought. To further emphasize the differences in battlefield doctrine between the British and Continental forces, each army has its own unique deck of Combat cards.&#10;&#10;Players, that are familiar with other Commands &amp; Colors games, will soon note that unit combat losses in a Tricorne game are typically not as great as other games covered in the Commands &amp; Colors series. This is a direct result of the linear tactic fighting style of the armies that fought during the American Revolution. Unit morale is the main thematic focus in a Tricorne battle as it was historically. Knowing that an entire unit, that has only taken minimal losses when forced to retreat, may actually break and rout from the battlefield, will definitely keep players on the edge of their command chairs during an entire battle.&#10;&#10;The 12 battles, showcased in the scenario section of this booklet, feature a stylized battlefield map that emphasize the important terrain features and highlight the historical deployment of forces in scale with the game system. These scenarios are a smattering of some of the better-known engagements of the American Revolution.&#10;&#10;Bunker Hill -17 June 1775&#10;Long Island (Grant's Attack) - 27 August 1776&#10;Long Island (British Flank March) - 27 August 1776&#10;Freeman's Farm - 19 September 1777&#10;Bemis Heights - 7 October 1777&#10;Bemis Heights (British Redoubts) - 7 October 1777&#10;Monmouth - 28 June 1778&#10;Camden - 16 August 1780&#10;Cowpens - 17 January 1781&#10;Guilford Courthouse - 15 March 1781&#10;Hobkirk's Hill - 25 April 1781&#10;Eutaw Springs - 8 September 1781&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Tindaya is set at the dawn of the 15th century on the paradise known today as the Canary Islands. The conquistadors have just set eyes on it. Each player must lead an aboriginal tribe to survival in a world ruled by gods and shaped by natural disasters.&#10;&#10;Tindaya is a theme-driven survival adventure with the soul of a eurogame. This environmentally conscious game offers two play modes to please any group: Cooperative (including solo) &amp; Competitive, in addition to the Traitor variant for players avid of some old fashioned throat-cutting. Difficulty can be graded, and less experienced gamers can learn to play through a 3 game mini-campaign.&#10;&#10;During 3 phases, natives will settle, progress, and battle invaders, all within a mythological setting ruled by two gods, Acoran &amp; Moneiba. They will demand specific goods at each stage of the game. If the natives are unable or unwilling to provide them, their godly rage will be unleashed. But players are not alone; two seers will make predictions by reading the smoke of their bonfires. Tibiabin will see the disasters to come. Tamonante will predict where they will happen. Disaster markers will be placed on the board to signal what is to come.&#10;&#10;End of the Game: In Cooperative mode, players will check if their collective mission has been achieved. If so, the gods will be happy, and all natives win the game. In Competitive mode, solidarity points will be granted to players that have given more to the community, used fewer resources, or achieved both collective and personal objectives. The player with more points will win the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "In The Ruhr: A Story of Coal Trade, the second game of Thomas Spitzer's historic coal trilogy, you are transported to the Ruhr region in the 18th century, at the beginning of the industrial revolution. Coal, after being discovered in Haspelknecht, is in high demand as cities and factories throughout the region are in need of this coveted resource. The Ruhr river presented a convenient route of transportation from the coal mines. However, the Ruhr was filled with obstacles and large dams, making it incredibly difficult to navigate. Trade coal for valuable upgrades and plan your route to victory along the Ruhr!&#10;&#10;In more detail, the players transport and sell coal to cities and factories along the Ruhr river in the 18th and 19th centuries. By selling coal to cities and factories, players acquire unique progress markers. In the beginning, players have access only to low value coal. By selling coal to certain locations, players gain access to high value coal. In addition to selling coal, the players build warehouses, build locks, and export coal to neighboring countries in the pursuit of the most victory points.&#10;&#10;This game, an updated version of Ruhrschifffahrt 1769-1890, includes the standalone expansion The Ohio: 1811-1861. In this game, players transport and trade goods along the Ohio River during a time when Ohio was granted statehood and became heavily populated as its industries flourished. The Ohio is played in a manner similar to The Ruhr, but with new and additional elements.&#10;&#10;",

Start by drawing a card and playing a card, but even those can be changed. There's no way to win at the begining, but once a Goal card is played, you have to play the appropriate Keeper cards in front of you or play other cards to keep them away from everyone else, like Steal a Keeper or play a new goal card to replace the old one.&#10;&#10;New to Fluxx are the Surprise cards which can be played at any time to cancel certain plays or steal a keeper as played.&#10;&#10;",

Players take the role of house lords and start with a deck containing some love cards and a few maids. During the game, players gradually employ more maids, increasing their deck of cards, and the player who collects the most victory points wins.&#10;&#10;Romantic Vacation includes love cards and maid cards like the parent game, but no event cards (curse cards) nor private maids (unique cards with a lasting effect). Instead the game introduces reminiscence cards, representing memorial events, like &quot;Camp Fire&quot;, &quot;Watching the stars&quot;, &quot;Picnic&quot;, etc. These cards are worth substantial victory points, but unlike the other victory points they are not bought with love, but gained by discarding a specified number of maid cards from your hand, thus introducing the possibility of getting victory points from pure maid cards, previously not possible. These reminiscence cards never enter a player's deck.&#10;&#10;",

The Russian Civil War 1918-1921 is a two-player wargame covering these dramatic events from August 1918 to the start of 1921, when the last organized opposition to Red rule outside the far east was destroyed.&#10;&#10;The single large-hex map stretches from Warsaw in the west to Omsk in the east and from Murmansk in the north to Tashkent in the south. Across this vast expanse, players maneuver a colorful array of combat units representing various White factions, Anarchists, Nationalists, Alied Intervention Forces, the two divisions of the Czech Legion, and six Polish armies.&#10;&#10;Units range from armies to brigades. The Red Order of Battle is built around 16 Red Armies organized by Leon Trotsky. There are also two powerful Red cavalry armies and the elite Latvian Rifle division. The White Order of Battle includes everything from Cossack cavalry corps to Muslim partisans and a German Free Corps. Each side also has support units: naval and river flotillas, air units, and, of course, the famous armored trains. Key leaders are also included: Frunze, Denikin, Wrangel, and Trotsky and his famous Red Train.&#10;&#10;To model the chaos of this many-sided multi-front war, the sequence of play is based upon random chit pull which determines the order of activation of each White faction or six Red Army Front commands. The key Logistics phase, in which disrupted units are rallied and unsupplied units attritted, is also randomly determined. The game also includes TWO random event tables: one for each side.&#10;From sweeping cavalry advances to slogging matches over major cities (such as Tsaritsyn - the future Stalingrad - know as the Red Verdun), Reds! is a true player's game. It is also a realistic depiction of some of the most titanic and unusual campaigns of modern history.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;    One 22 x 34&quot; Game Map&#10;    One Sheet of 240 Counters&#10;    Two Player Aid Cards&#10;    One Rule Book &#10;&#10;&#10;TIME SCALE     1-2 months per turn&#10;MAP SCALE     65 miles per hex&#10;UNIT SCALE     Brigades, Divisions, Corps, and Armies&#10;NUMBER OF PLAYERS     Two&#10;&#10;DESIGNER: Ted Raicer&#10;DEVELOPER: Andy Lewis and Volko Ruhnke&#10;ART DIRECTOR: Rodger B.

After moving their tokens on to a planet, players use an interesting little device ('planet ring'/'wormhole' - functions like a blind draw bag) to select one of the tokens on the planet.  Players take actions by collecting sets of cards which correspond to the the various planets.  The game also features a unique trading system which facilitates the card collecting. Careful card trading and calculating risk of establishing economic centers, and some variants, mitigate some of the luck factor.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Summary&#10;Setup: 9 cards/player. Place 1 cube per planet per player, plus additional cube per planet matching cards dealt out; remaining cubes on earth. Each gets 2 special action cards.Each round: First, players may play a single special action card, in order. Then, Trade Step. Finally, Action Step.&#10;&#10;Trade Step: Start player first plays cards (2-3) to offer, one at a time; other players simultaneously show cards to trade, different than offered. Start player must trade; recipient either accepts cards into hand, or leaves out. Clockwise from Start Player, next player with cards still in front of them either makes a trade or takes their cards back. Continue till 0-1 people left with cards in front; they take them back to hand.&#10;&#10;Action Step: Start player takes 3 actions, then others take 2 each. Actions can be:&#10;- discard 2 cards, then draw 2&#10;- turn in set of 3-7 cards to send half (rounding down) as many cubes from earth to a planet&#10;- turn in set of 3-7 cards to advance Ship Level, Tech Level, or to make attempt to establish colony on a planet matching cards played: place cubes on that planet into the cosmic ashtray, randomize, then reveal up to as many cubes as attempts made. If reveal your cube, place it on a station; turn over. If other player's cube, send it back to earth.&#10;- Sets: if no wilds (&quot;pure&quot;), take appropriate bonus wild card matching the size of the set (if available); wilds can be used later as parts of sets&#10;&#10;Then rotate starting player to the left.

Design the foundations of a great pre-Columbian civilization, with its buildings, temples, and a grand pyramid in the center. Find perfect locations for production buildings and great temples, and build the might of the great pyramid overlooking your city. Establish yourself as the very best among competing architects, and your project will secure you a spot among the great Founders of Teotihuacan!&#10;&#10;Founders of Teotihuacan is a strategy game where you compete against your friends to create the best design of the city of Teotihuacan. Over the course of three to four rounds you will place your action disks to the main board, forming towers of varying strength, strategically use the bonuses they offer, and construct temples, resource buildings and the pyramid central to your project of Teotihuacan. You will balance generating resources and using them, as finding good locations on your city board becomes increasingly more difficult, and you will try to outwit your opponents, making use of an innovative and interactive action system. Finally, once the eclipse comes, all designs will be assessed and the player with the most points will win and become the architect to join the ranks of Founders of Teotihuacan!&#10;&#10;Founders of Teotihuacan is a stand-alone game, related to Teotihuacan: City of Gods only by the shared setting of the ancient city of Teotihuacan. Thematically, the events in Founders takes place at an earlier time in history, while what was to become a magnificent city was yet in its infancy and only few inhabited the area.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you must either perform an Action or pass. To perform an Action, place between 1 and 3 of your Action disks on an Action space on the Main board that already contains at least one disk (minimum a Bonus disk and possibly also opponent disk(s)), and carry out a corresponding Action. The Action disk(s) should be placed on top of the disk(s) already on that space, forming a stack. Each Action space can hold a maximum of 4 Action disks&mdash;including Bonus disks!&#10;&#10;Your personal player board is divided into four Districts or quadrants. Buildings and Temples can only be placed within the two Districts closest to your Architect. Pyramid tiles can only be placed within the six Pyramid squares closest to your Architect. Your Action Strength is equal to the total number of disks (whether yours, an opponent&rsquo;s disks, or Bonus disks) on an Action space.&#10;&#10;After performing an Action (not when passing), move your Architect clockwise to the next side of your Player board, signifying&#10;the end of your turn. This changes your Architect's Reach for your next turn. After all players have passed, the current round ends.&#10;&#10;After the game has ended, players score additional Victory Points for how well their Districts complement their Pyramid.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Pluckin' Pairs embodies the same spirit as the classic party game Compatibility in that you want to match images with other players in order to score points, but the game play is more free form with everyone competing individually instead of in teams.&#10;&#10;At the start of a round, eleven images are laid out on the table. All players secretly pair off images &ndash; say, coins and a manhole cover because they're both round, or a mirror and a building because they both reflect light &ndash; and write these pairs on their player sheet. One image will be leftover as the outcast.&#10;&#10;After everyone has finished, you compare your pairs with those of other players. If no one &ndash; or conversely if everyone &ndash; created the same pair as you, you score no points for that pair. If only some of the players created that pair, each of those players scores as many points as the number of players who record the pair. (You can optionally compare outcast images as well, scoring points based on who had the same outcast as you.) The player with the most points after a certain number of rounds wins.&#10;&#10;",

Each of these miniatures is detailed, characterful, and true to the classic spirit of Necromunda &mdash; hairstyles and all! These gangs are multi-part kits, with an enormous level of customization. There are weapons for any situation, from classics like the stub gun to more esoteric choices like the repurposed industrial equipment of House Goliath or the chem-weapons of the Eschers.&#10;&#10;The set's gaming tiles and simple bulkhead scenery allow you to play games quickly and easily. As well as the underhive style of play covered by the boxed set, there will also be ways to play Necromunda with the multi-level skirmishes that defined the classic version of the game.&#10;&#10;",

Star Munchkin is a complete game using the best-selling Munchkin rules (with a few new twists like Sidekicks), and it can be combined with any other Munchkin items.&#10;&#10;Part of the Munchkin series.&#10;&#10;Munchkin is a satirical card game based on the clich&eacute;s and oddities of Dungeons and Dragons and other role-playing games. Each player starts at level 1 and the winner is the first player to reach level 10. Players can acquire familiar D&amp;D style character classes during the game which determine to some extent the cards they can play.&#10;&#10;There are two types of cards - treasure and encounters. Each turn the current players 'kicks down the door' - drawing an encounter card from the deck. Usually this will involve battling a monster. Monsters have their own levels and players must try and overcome it using the levels, weapons and powers they have acquired during the game or run away. Other players can chose to help the player or hinder by adding extra monsters to the encounter. Defeating a monster will usually result in drawing treasure cards and acquiring levels. Being defeated by a monster results in &quot;bad stuff&quot; which usually involves losing levels and treasure.&#10;&#10;Note: The 2012 edition of Star Munchkin from Pegasus Spiele includes the first expansion, Star Munchkin 2: The Clown Wars. The same applies to Italian edition from Raven Distribution.&#10;&#10;",

In Canterbury, 2 to 4 players represent Saxon Lords who are charged with building the city into a prosperous capital. The Saxon Lords must use the city's meager starting resources to build up the 25 districts of Canterbury and provide key services to its citizens.&#10;&#10;The key services are (in order from most basic to most prestigious) water, food, religion, defense, commerce, and culture. These services are provided by structures that are built in the various districts. However, structures that provide higher end services can only be built if the more basic services are already present in that district. For example, a Saxon Lord cannot order the construction of a chapel (which provides religion) unless there is already water and food in that district.&#10;&#10;As new structures are built in the city, the city grows more prosperous. While each Saxon Lord jealously guards his or her own prosperity and achievements, they all benefit as a whole from the growing prosperity of the city itself. The city treasury grows as the city prospers, and the Saxon Lords must balance their publicly scrutinized withdrawals from the treasury with the ambition of their building projects. When the city reaches the peak of its prosperity, the game ends and the player with the most individual prosperity wins the game.&#10;&#10;Object of the Game&#10;&#10;Every structure that is built in Canterbury provides Prosperity Points both to the city and to the Saxon Lord who ordained its construction. When the City Marker passes 300 Prosperity, there is one final round of play, and then the game ends. The player with the most individual Prosperity earns the accolades of the king and wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

Test your wit and instincts in this two-player game of vision and versatility!&#10;&#10;Agility applies a unique mechanic in which cards that supply resources also select actions. On your turn, you play a Training Card that provides one of two types of resources in varying quantities while also granting an action building off of what your opponent just played. This encourages clever planning and timing. Training you need may be at odds with the action you&rsquo;d like, so weighing your options will be crucial. Resources may be used to adopt dogs or to clear obstacles on the three courses you've drafted from the six available each game. Courses can only be claimed once a dog is adopted, so there is a race within a race to snatch up Wonderdogs or Underdogs well suited to the available courses. Then it&rsquo;s nip and tuck as the canine competitors bound over, under, and through to the finish lines!&#10;&#10;",

The game's interactive system of play assures that each scenario will be unpredictable, exciting and competitive.

As I crashed to the ground, I knew I had found, at last, peace.&#10;&#10;Ragemore is an 18 card solo game where you will complete quests, while managing your hand and resources as you delve though the dark, fighting demons, all in a span of 10-15 minutes.&#10;&#10;Each card is two sided; a demon and a hero. In the beginning of the game, the player will set up 2 piles of demon-sided quests and a party of 3 hero-sided cards. Then an immediate threat is revealed from the draw deck as the current demon card that may or may not be dealt with. If it is not killed, the demon card will go to one of the quests piles and an event written on that card will take effect. If it is killed, the demon card is flipped to the hero side and becomes one of the party. The player can also ignore the immediate demon threat and goes on a quest to obtain the win condition, or parlay with some of the demons to turn them into heroes but with the cost of the hero's morality: the hero is flipped to the demon side and joins the draw deck of demons.&#10;&#10;The game is won when the hero gains the required number of quest card by using a combination of four symbols drawn on each cards. The game is lost when the graveyard has 3 deaths or when a quest pile has 4 demons or the party has no more heroes or the draw deck of demons is empty before the number of quest cards is fulfilled or if the quest piles are empty before the number of quest cards is fulfilled. 1 winning condition and 5 losing conditions.&#10;&#10;&#10;Released in the May 2020 Board Game of the Month Club $20+ package.&#10;&#10;",

Plus, the package includes double-sided mounted maps for all four battles!&#10;&#10;Saratoga:&#10;&#10;     Includes all the replacement counters that have been provided over the years, plus new Momentum counters and &ldquo;Rally on Me&rdquo; (see description under &ldquo;Brandywine,&rdquo; below) counters for the series.&nbsp;&#10;     This battle includes a new historical scenario featuring the fighting around Freeman&rsquo;s Farm.&#10;&#10;&#10;Brandywine:&#10;&#10;    An updated countersheet includes all the counters updated over the years, plus a new marker to the series, &ldquo;Rally on Me!&rdquo;&nbsp; As you know, one of the combat results is Disruption.&nbsp; When this occurs, a Disruption Marker is placed on&nbsp;top&nbsp;of the Disrupted unit.&nbsp; If the Disrupted unit is alone in a hex or if it stacks with other units that are also Disrupted, there is no issue because the Disruption Marker remains on top of the stack, in plain sight signifying that every unit under it is Disrupted.&nbsp; It serves as reminder to the player to roll for Rally in the Rally Phase.&nbsp; When, however, Disrupted units stack with Parade Order units, those Parade Order units are placed above the Disruption Marker.&nbsp; This typically obscures the Disruption Marker within the stack.&nbsp; Particularly in larger games with high counter density and multiple fronts, where lots of action is occurring, players often forget to make their Rally rolls because they can&rsquo;t readily see the Disruption Markers.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Rally on Me!&rdquo; Marker is primarily intended to be placed on top of any stack that contains a combination of Disrupted and Parade Order units in the same hex.&nbsp; This will be a visual cue for the player to remember his Rally die roll.&nbsp;&#10;     There is a new amusettes counter among the Hessian forces in Brandywine&#10;     Includes an updated Brandywine mounted map with redone Charlie Kibler artwork.&#10;     The Brandywine rules have been split into a Series Rule Book and an Exclusive Rule Book. A couple of key updates here:&#10;        &nbsp;Updated unit deployment protocol for the Knyphausen&rsquo;s Feint scenario in the Exclusive Rule Book.&#10;        &nbsp;Also in the Exclusive Rules, new&nbsp;optional&nbsp;intelligence rules called, &ldquo;Muddying the Waters of Brandywine Creek&rdquo; are introduced.&nbsp;While the original game attempts to model the lack of good intelligence that plagued Washington by restricting American movement within the American Army Bivouac Area until a certain point in the game, this and the other devices used like optional British Brigade entry zones have become &ldquo;set-piece&rdquo; after all these years.&nbsp; Players familiar with this game can &ldquo;game&rdquo; those intel rules enough to mitigate their impact and as a result, the flow of action across the board is becoming a little too predictable.&nbsp; The new &ldquo;Muddy&rdquo; rules introduce a random element into both players&rsquo; decision making.&nbsp; There are four possible permutations: 1) neither do a recon, 2) both do a recon, 3) only the Brits do a recon, and 4) only the Americans do a recon.&nbsp; This is further complicated by five different possible states of the upper ford on the Brandywine (off-map):&nbsp; 1) Blocked, 2) Partially Blocked, 3) Hindered, 4) Open and 5) Dry.&nbsp; The interplay of these factors will influence how each side can maneuver so that it can never become predictable.&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;Guilford/Eutaw Springs:&#10;&#10;     Mounted Mapboards for each game&#10;     Updated Victory Conditions for each game&#10;     An Updated Looting Table for Eutaw Springs&#10;     Replacement counters for each game.&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Awakening the Bear is the first game in the multi-award winning Conflict of Heroes series. This series is a squad level combined arms training game used by history fans, universities, and military personnel throughout the world.  This game takes you to the eastern front during Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of Russia. Many consider this time period to be the birth of modern warfare tactics that continue to be used and perfected by today's modern armies.&#10;&#10;You command German or Soviet forces comprised of infantry squads, crewed support weapons, individual tanks, armored cars, artillery, and more. Much effort went into distinguishing the units in the game by highlighting their historical strengths and weaknesses. For example, each tank's defense rating takes into account relative armor thickness, armor slope deflection percentage, speed, size, targeting mechanics, and crew training. All these factors are represented in an easy to learn target number system. You do not have to worry about the details; they are all built into the system! As the commander, you concentrate on tactics to execute your mission and firefight objectives.&#10;&#10;The 3rd Edition Rules change several key elements of Conflict of Heroes from previous editions. A Unit no longer receives 7  Action Points. Instead, each Turn, a player selects one of their Units to take an Action. After completing the Action, they roll a custom d10 die to determine if the Unit becomes Spent. If the player rolls higher than the Action&rsquo;s Cost, the Unit is free to continue taking Actions on future Turns. More involved Actions have a higher Spent probability. On average, Units will be able to take the same number of Actions as in the previous 7AP edition rules, but now your units may not always perform as expected.&#10;&#10;This and other new mechanics like Stress encourage players to experiment with integrated battlefield tactics that make use of multiple Units working together. They also heighten the experience of &lsquo;Fog of War,&rsquo; in that players must now assess the risk attached to each Action they take, and determine the best time to use their CAPs to mitigate that risk.&#10;&#10;All previous Conflict of Heroes editions are 100% compatible with these 3rd Edition rules. This game can also be played with previous edition rules.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "In Gulf, Mobile &amp; Ohio, the third entry in Winsome Games's Historic Railroads System, players build railroads in the South that existed between 1830-1860, with the game board featuring cities from Richmond to New Orleans, and from Memphis to Savannah. Twenty-three different railroad lines exist in the game, each represented by two shares of stock: a charter share for the player who founds this railroad, and a common share that might be auctioned later in the game. Eight railroads are designated as starting lines, and initially only the shares for these eight lines are available to players. Railroad lines will be represented on the game board with wooden cubes that come in six colors, with the number of cubes ranging from 6 to 32.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player takes one of four actions:&#10;&#10;&bull; Charter a railroad: The active player starts an auction for the charter share of a railroad that hasn't yet been founded. Players place bids for this share, with the winner claiming this charter share, placing a cube of the color that's most common on it, then using the money spent in the auction to place additional cubes on the game board at a cost of $3/cube. One cube of the same color is placed in the railroad's starting city (and sometimes you have a choice of starting city), and additional cubes are placed on track intersections and in connecting cities. You must bid enough that you can place this line in at least two cities. If the color of the cube that's most available in the stock is already in this city (thanks to railroad lines previously built), then the active player can't put this line up for auction.&#10;&#10;Whenever you build or expand railroad lines, you can't place cubes so that two lines of the same color touch. If a white cube has been placed in Grenada, for example, you can't found the MC or M&amp;T lines in that city if white is the most common color of cubes.&#10;&#10;&bull; Auction a common share: Once the charter share of a line has been acquired, the active player can start an auction for the common share of that line, with the winning bid once again being used to expand that line with additional cubes of that railroad's color, although in this case you have no building requirement and a winning bid of $0 is allowed.&#10;&#10;After each auction, a &quot;common share&quot; tracking marker is moved, and after the second such movement, players receive dividends from the bank for the shares they hold: $5 for a charter share when that railroad has issued only that one share, and $3 for each share otherwise held.&#10;&#10;&bull; Expand a line: If you own the charter share of a line, you can spend your funds to expand this line.&#10;&#10;&bull; Pass: If all players pass in turn, the game ends.&#10;&#10;When a railroad line expands into a city that's the starting city for a railroad line not yet available in the auction pool, you take the two shares of that new line and place them in the auction pool.&#10;&#10;Each time you build railroad lines, you score victory points: 1 VP for founding a new line (with three lines being worth 2 VP), 1 VP for placing a cube in a city (2 VP for going into Atlanta), and 1 VP for the first time that a line connects to a line of each other color (which can occur only in cities). If all players pass in turn or the sixth color of cubes is on the board following the chartering of a railroad, the game ends. Whoever has the most points wins!&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "From spielbox-online.de, translated via altavista babel fish (with a lot of manual tweaks):&#10;&#10;Magna Grecia (The cradle of the civilization) is the main attraction of the year with Clementoni. The game is a joint work of Leo Colovini and Michael Schacht.&#10;&#10;The southern region of Italy was called Magna Grecia and was settled 2,500 years ago by Greek merchants and adventurers. Before the arrival of the Greeks, the country was inhabited by only a few small tribes. Fruitful soil, navigable rivers, large forests, and bronze and silver mines offered enormous development possibilities. Larger cities developed, such as Tarantum, Syracuse, Katane, Locri, and Naxos. In addition, there were numerous villages of which no trace remains. A local road system promoted trade, and rich markets developed in the cities. More and more rivalries between the cities arose, particularly over control of the Oracle, which represented an important source for fame and wealth.&#10;&#10;Sufficient material for an evening of play. Each player must successfully settle and develop Magna Grecia. At favorable points, markets are built, villages are developed into cities and interconnected by a road system. Only thus may the interior be opened and the Oracle controlled. Constructing your own large city is often very expensive, and it is sometimes worthwhile to build instead in the neutral villages or opponents' cities.&#10;&#10;The board is covered with a hexagon grid on which pieces of road, towns, or markets are placed. A game is 12 rounds long. Each round is determined by an action map, which is set up at the beginning of play according to a certain pattern. The map specifies the player sequence and indicates to which extent the three basic actions (road construction, city building, and supply) may be used. There are also, of course, certain building rules to be considered. Additionally, markets can be established, the value of which depends on the number of connected locations. The Oracle is shown on the board. In order to control the Oracle, a player must connect one of his own cities to it by road. But if several cities are connected to an Oracle, the most important city takes precedence, determined by the number of locations connected to the city (not including Oracles).&#10;&#10;Markets and the Oracle determine when the game ends.&#10;&#10;",

You will compete with your coworkers for access to building blueprints, astronauts, and construction resources- all to develop the most successful moonbase!&#10;&#10;Lunarchitects is a medium-weight strategy game that has players moving their pawns forward in a refilling circular queue to claim building blueprints. Players use the claimed blueprints to build personal moonbase plans in front of them. But instead of turns proceeding clockwise, the player furthest behind in the queue always takes the next turn. This makes blueprint choices a matter of quality over quantity.&#10;&#10;Blueprints from four stages are shuffled then stacked, with stages increasing in both cost and power. Each time all players complete a lap of the blueprint queue, scoring occurs- and the game ends after the fourth round of scoring. The player who has collected the most points is the winner, and their plans will guide the creation the first settlement on the moon!&#10;&#10;Unknown tile arrangement and variable scoring schemes (determined before the start) makes the game very replayable, as there is never a single most-powerful strategy.&#10;&#10;Inspired by the well-loved game Glen More, Lunarchitects is a family game for 1-5 players that plays in about an hour.&#10;&#10;",

However, with nobles from all the other factions at court as well, your influence on the duke is limited.    &#10; Through wisely using the nobles you send to court though, you may be able to reduce your rival&rsquo;s influence while increasing your own faction&rsquo;s prestige.&#10;&#10;-from publisher&#10;&#10;Court of the Medici FAQ&#10;&#10;",

Randomly drawn number cards are auctioned one at a time, with the highest bidder placing a chip on the matching board space. Wild/Payoff cards give players a choice of where to place their chip and also award cash to all players for their chips on the board: $7 per chip, with a maximum payoff of $49.&#10;&#10;The first player to claim four spaces in a row, in any direction, wins.&#10;&#10;Zillionaires on Mars and Zillionaires: Road Trip USA keep the same gameplay as in the game's original release, but with dollar values now in the zillions as players bid for lots on Mars or roadside attractions alongside U.S. highways.&#10;&#10;Luck: The Game offers the same gameplay in a handy travel bag with the game board printed right on the bag.

Players can acquire familiar D&amp;D style character classes during the game which determine to some extent the cards they can play.&#10;&#10;There are two types of cards - treasure and encounters. Each turn the current players &quot;kicks down the door&quot; by drawing an encounter card from the deck. Usually this will involve battling a monster. Monsters have their own levels and players must try and overcome it using the levels, weapons and powers they have acquired during the game or run away. Other players can chose to help the player or hinder by adding extra monsters to the encounter. Defeating a monster will usually result in drawing treasure cards and acquiring levels. Being defeated by a monster results in &quot;bad stuff&quot; which usually involves losing levels and treasure.&#10;&#10;",

Players of Confucius participate in this discreet and delicate struggle for power. As well as influencing the three principal ministries of government, leadership of the great exploration and trading fleets will bring renown to the one who heads them, and glory attends the general leading invasions of foreign lands.&#10;&#10;",

On one side are the Athenians and the Delian League, the Demos team; against them, the Oligarchs of Sparta and Corinth are teamed.&#10;&#10;The Peloponnesian War is a great setting for a historical game, having two evenly matched factions with very differing capabilities. Athens (and the Delian League, including Corcyra) commanded the seas, and relied on trade to feed their masses. On land, the Spartan phalanx was virtually unbeatable, as all adult Spartan male citizens were professional soldiers&#10;&#10;Players of Quartermaster General will find most of the concepts familiar. Since the game has a smaller maximum player count, the amount of activity during a turn has been slightly increased.For example, after the Play step there is a Planning step, when you can place a Prepare card on the table. Prepare cards in Victory or Death work a lot like Response Cards in Quartermaster General, but have a much broader scope of application. Many Prepare cards are used during the Strategy step, which is at the beginning of a player's turn. Much of the game play is structured around putting together effective combinations of played cards and prepared cards.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "In Evolution: The Origin of Species, players do the work of nature, putting animals into play and evolving them trait by trait to help them survive and thrive. Each player starts with a hand of six cards that feature an animal on the back and one or two traits on the front.&#10;&#10;Each round consists of four phases. During Development, players take turns playing one card from their hand either as an animal (face-down) or as a trait on one of their existing animals (face-up and tucked under the animal). Traits include Carnivorous, Camouflage, Sharp Vision, Swimming, Poisonous and Communication; if a card has two traits, the player chooses which trait the animal acquires, hiding the other trait under the animal. Once a player passes during this phase, he can no longer play cards.&#10;&#10;During Food Bank Determination, a player rolls 1-2 dice (possibly adding two to the total) to determine the amount of food available for the round.&#10;&#10;During Feeding, players take turns acquiring one food cube and &quot;feeding&quot; one of their animals. Some traits give animals special abilities that can be used during Feeding or at other points during the game. Animals can also be carnivorous, allowing them to attack one other animal to feed &ndash; although that animal might have a defense like High Body Weight or Tail Loss that allows it to survive. An animal can't take more food than it needs unless it has fat tissue, which allows it to store food for future rounds.&#10;&#10;During Extinction and Draw, any animal not fully fed dies; the owner takes that animal and all traits and stacks them in his personal discard pile. Each player then receives new cards in hand equal to one plus the number of live animals that player has.&#10;&#10;When the deck runs out, the players conduct one final round, then score points. Each live animal is worth 2 VP, and each trait on a live animal worth 1 VP; some traits (Carnivorous and Parasite) provide bonus VPs, but make it tougher to keep an animal alive. The player with the most VPs wins.&#10;&#10;By combining two sets of Evolution, you can have up to eight players in a game.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Kings of Israel is a board game taking place in Israel (the Northern Kingdom) during the reign of its kings up until Israel's destruction by Assyria. Players are on a team, with each person representing a line of prophets that are trying to remove evil and idols from Israel, while building altars to help guide Israel in the upcoming difficult years. If the players are able to build enough altars before the game ends, they win. If the game ends by either the team running out of sin cubes or idols, or by Assyria destroying Israel, the prophets lose.&#10;&#10;A typical round has four phases:&#10;&#10;1.  King's Godliness Phase: During this phase, if a bad king is reigning over Israel, the players must draw a Sin &amp; Punishment card, which means bad things occur in Israel because of evil or in response to evil. If during the reign of a good king, the starting player receives a Blessing card.&#10;&#10;2.  Sin Increases Phase: Location cards are drawn and sin increases at each revealed location. This can possibly cause idols to appear or sin to spread further if sin increases at a location with an idol.&#10;&#10;3.  Prophets Work Phase: In this phase each prophet gets to use four actions to accomplish their goals. They may use their actions to move, remove sin or idols, draw resource cards, build an altar, make a sacrifice at an altar, or to give resources to another player. A prophets may also play Blessing cards at this time if they have them. In expert mode, after all the prophets take their turn, the false prophet takes his turn.&#10;&#10;4.  End of Round Phase: The starting player changes to the next player and the timeline token moves down to the next king chronologically. In easy mode, any player who had made a sacrifice that turn then draws a single Blessing card.&#10;&#10;The family version of Kings of Israel is available on the game's website. This version eliminates the King's Godliness phase, Abilities, and the Blessing cards, which makes for an easier, quicker, and more simplified game.&#10;&#10;",

The set collection aspect of rummy is basically the same, with groups of three cards in either runs or denominations making a valid meld. The twist is that in each hand the number of cards required to create a meld increases, from three cards in the first hand to thirteen in the last. The game, therefore, consists of eleven hands.&#10;&#10;In each hand, in addition to the six Jokers, other cards are designated as wild: in the first hand 3s are wild; in the second hand 4s are wild, and so on until in the last hand the Kings go wild. (You can remember which cards are wild because it matches the number of cards in hand, i.e., in the first hand you hold three cards and 3s are wild.) A hand ends when a player can meld all cards in her hand after the discard.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Korea: The Forgotten War, Is the ninth game in the Operational Combat Series (OCS) release by The Gamers.&#10;&#10;The Korean War stands as a key event in world history. The first shooting confrontation of the Cold War, and the first limited war of the nuclear age, it is the only time since the Second World War that two of the world's major military powers fought one another - in this case the United States and China.&#10;&#10;Diplomatically, the war offers an interesting view of the miscalculation and ineptitude on both sides that led to open conflict. It also brings to light the United Nations' first opportunity to play a leading role in world military events.&#10;&#10;Korea: The Forgotten War covers the first year of the war and highlights the mobile phases of the battle. Campaign victory is determined most often by the stable positions of the lines (relative to the &quot;neck&quot; of the peninsula). A number of shorter scenarios are also included to allow players to explore specific operations or to use as a training scenario before taking on one of the campaign games.&#10;&#10;Korea: The Forgotten War was initially released in 2003. The 2014 (2nd edition) is a reprint of the 2003 (1st edition) with changes made to address errata and to better conform to the latest version of the OCS rules when printed.&#10;&#10;&#10;Korea: The Forgotten War has 15 scenarios broken down as follows:&#10;    5 1-map scenarios&#10;    4 2-map scenarios&#10;    6 3-map scenarios&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Turn: Half-week&#10;Hex: 5 miles / 8 Km&#10;Units: Battalion to Army&#10;&#10;2014 Game Inventory:&#10;Three 22 x 34&quot; full-color mapsheets&#10;Four dual-side printed countersheets (2 combat, 2 markers - 560 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 48-page OCS v4.1a rules booklet&#10;One 40-page Korea v2.0 game specific rules booklet&#10;Two 4-page OCS v4.1a Charts &amp; Tables Folders&#10;Two dual-sided Player Aid cards&#10;Two 6-sided dice&#10;&#10;Complexity: High&#10;Solitaire Suitability: High&#10;Playing Time: 4-100 hours&#10;Players: 1 or more&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Illuminati is a classic Steve Jackson (I) game of world domination. Each player takes on the role of a secret society attempting to spread its tendrils into special interest groups throughout the world.&#10;&#10;The game consists of three different cards (illuminati cards, group cards, and special event cards) and money. During a player's turn, a new card is drawn from a deck containing both group cards and special event cards. If it is a special event, the player in turn keeps the card and plays it when desired. If it is a group card, it is turned up along with any other face-up cards. The player in turn may then attempt to take over any group. This can be either a group on the table or a group already controlled by another player. If another player already controls the group it is more difficult to take it over, but not impossible.&#10;&#10;How difficult it is to take over a group depends on the strength of the controlling group, the resistance of the group being taken over, the proximity of the group being taken over to the controlling player's illuminati card (if someone already controls it), and other factors. Once this is determined, both the attacking and defending player can modify the odds further by spending &quot;megabucks&quot;. Once a group is taken over, it has to be attached to the card structure the player already controls. How cards can be attached to each other is limited by in- and outbound arrows on the cards, and maintaining a well-structured tree of groups can be vital to success.&#10;&#10;The winning condition for each player is different and depends on what illuminati card that player has.&#10;&#10;This first edition contains 54 small black and white cards.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Illuminati Expansion Set 1&#10;    Illuminati Expansion Set 2&#10;    Illuminati Expansion Set 3&#10;&#10;&#10;Re-published as:&#10;&#10;    Illuminati&#10;&#10;&#10;CCG Version:&#10;&#10;    Illuminati: New World Order&#10;&#10;&#10;Magazine Articles:&#10;&#10;    Imagine (Issue 6 - Sep 1983)&#10;        European Illuminati - New cards.&#10;    &#10;    The Space Gamer (Issue 59 - Jan 1983)&#10;        Illuminating the Post Office - Converting six groups to Illuminati.&#10;    &#10;    Space Gamer (Issue 72 - Jan 1985)&#10;        Death to Deadheads! - Variant rules for Illuminati, The Evil Geniuses Are Here! - Variant new cards for Illuminati, More Groups Illuminated! - A couple more illuminated groups for Illuminati, The Monty Python Illuminati - The British Illuminati, 24 groups, and 3 special cards with a Monty Python theme.&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;",

For each cyclist the player chooses one of his available movement allowances and moves that many squares.

The New Order Games edition is for 3-5 players, with a separate expansion allowing an additional four players to compete.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "We&rsquo;re going back to where it all began. Following the Resident Evil 2 (2019) and Resident Evil 3(2021) board games, Resident Evil: The Board Game (2023) brings the sinister Spencer Mansion to the tabletop in a terrifying open world campaign. Based on the 2002 remake of the original Resident Evil video game, Resident Evil: The Board Game is a cooperative survival horror board game for 1-4 players.&#10;&#10;Built on the survival horror engine of the previous two board games, Resident Evil: The Board Game introduces a slew of new and updated mechanics to keep you on your toes. Solve ingenious new puzzles to unlock doors, build the mansion map as you explore, send non-player characters on valuable missions, and more. Setup is swift because each scenario begins with just a few tiles. As you explore and open doors, you&rsquo;ll build out the map, opening new pathways and discovering useful items&hellip; and deadly enemies.&#10;&#10;Resident Evil: The Board Game is a campaign game playable over 27 hours, where every decision counts and has far-reaching consequences. Every resource must be managed, every bullet counted. Fighting isn&rsquo;t the only way to survive. You&rsquo;ll have to decide when to attack and when to flee. But you won&rsquo;t always get a choice! As your campaign goes on, the mansion will evolve and the danger level will rise. The tension and encounter decks will change, adding mysterious new cards and altering the effects of old cards to make them even more dangerous. But effects don&rsquo;t just happen over time. Tension cards can change enemy behaviours at any moment, making them more lethal from one turn to the next.&#10;&#10;Short on time? Each Resident Evil: The Board Game scenario is also playable as a 60-90 minute one-shot, for bite-sized nightmare sessions.&#10;&#10;In the darkness lie your fears. Can you fight them and survive?&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "&quot;In the Ashes&quot; is a revolutionary action RPG adventure played within a book, using only a pencil.&#10;&#10;You've read that right: &quot;In the Ashes&quot; is not played with miniatures placed on tiles like other board games, but everything is played within the book. My intention over the past few years has been to distill the entire experience provided by the great thematic-narrative games into a compact and portable product, yet with great depth in mechanics, story, tactics, and atmosphere.&#10;&#10;&quot;In the Ashes&quot; can be seen as a solo dungeon crawler with an epic campaign, legendary battles, and a dramatic story that will provide you with memorable plays anywhere, all within the confines of this book.&#10;&#10;The experience of the great thematic-narrative games, in book format.&#10;&#10;This means that by drawing and marking on the paper:&#10;&#10;You'll move your character across the board to fight against sinister enemies.&#10;You'll play action cards to create spectacular combos.&#10;You'll level up your character to specialize in forbidden disciplines.&#10;You'll find legendary items to enhance your abilities.&#10;You'll make difficult decisions that will affect the story.&#10;You'll tempt fate by applying sources of controlled chance to actions and behaviors.&#10;You'll battle powerful bosses with unique mechanics and cunning intelligence.&#10;You'll discover hidden references in the images that will grant you access to secret advantages.&#10;You'll be able to study a grimoire of runes to boost your attacks.&#10;And all this you'll do in the book, using nothing more than a pencil (or a pen).&#10;&#10;An epic campaign of more than 12 hours and fully replayable.&#10;&#10;&quot;In the Ashes&quot; has been designed from the ground up to be played solo. You'll play through crucial moments in the lives of various characters, switching between them as the story requires. However, nothing is stopping you from playing in a group, reading, fighting, drawing, and making decisions together.&#10;&#10;If you're looking for an experience inspired by games like &quot;Descent&quot;, &quot;Imperial Assault&quot;, &quot;Gloomhaven&quot;, &quot;Kingdom Death Monster&quot;, &quot;Tainted Grail&quot;, &quot;Mansions of Madness&quot;, &quot;Arkham Horror LCG&quot;, &quot;Journeys in Middle-Earth&quot;, or &quot;Sleeping Gods&quot;, but differently and originally, portable and compact, this is your game.&#10;&#10;It takes a second to start playing &quot;In the Ashes&quot;, and another second to pack it away. Whether you have only five minutes or an entire afternoon, you can play it on the train, at the beach, at a bus stop, on the sofa, or even lying in bed. There's no need to erase anything, even when you want to replay the campaign after finishing it.&#10;&#10;&quot;In the Ashes&quot; follows an &quot;open and play&quot; philosophy: you'll learn to play as you progress through the first pages, in a tutorial of increasing complexity fully integrated with the story. However, detailed rules are available in the final pages for consultation whenever you want.&#10;&#10;Focus on living the adventure, without maintenance or complications.&#10;&#10;You don't need a table, an app, to print out a character sheet, or even an eraser (there's no need to erase anything). Forget about constantly flipping from page to page to read sections or check statistics, as the book has been designed to minimize upkeep so that you can spend your playtime fully immersed in the different scenes, applying your strategy to each challenge.&#10;&#10;You also don't need dice (though you can use them if you like), as the sources of controlled randomness are in the book itself. As you progress through the story and unlock new characters, you'll need not just luck, but also your memory, insight, and precision to maximize your attacks.&#10;&#10;Is an epic solitaire adventure with tactical tabletop combat that offers you a 12-hour narrative campaign that's fully replayable. You can set up and save your current situation instantly, and you can play as long as you want &mdash; from five minutes to all day. It contains an epic story with character evolution, dozens of enemies, legendary items, and spectacular combos with cards.&#10;&#10;",

Each turn you can choose a card and advance or advance and choose a card.&#10;&#10;At the end of the track, there are different wineries (each preferring a different kind of grape variety). Get the best reward for your harvest from the local wineries by matching your hand of grapes with their needs. If the players go quickly, they may get the best cards, but risk not having enough grapes. If they go too slow, the competition can beat them to the best vines!&#10;&#10;Selling your grapes to the wineries gets the players prestige points, and each player has a limited amount of deliveries. The end game triggers when a player makes their last grape delivery. The other players can finish moving through their track. Then, everyone counts their prestige points gained through their previous deliveries, and the player with the most points wins!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Build barricades, clash with police, occupy districts, loot shopping centers, build mutual aid networks, and liberate the city before time runs out and the military arrives!&#10;&#10;Object of the Game: When playing fully cooperatively, all factions win or lose together and must cooperate to defeat the police and liberate the city. To liberate the city, each faction must complete the objectives on 1 Conditions card. Each Conditions card specifies certain districts of the city that must be liberated and where occupations must be built. When playing semi-cooperatively, each faction has a secret Agenda card that determines how it wins the game. Factions with Social Agendas can still win together cooperatively. But a faction with a Vanguardist or Sectarian Agenda can only win alone and must work covertly to undermine the other factions.&#10;&#10;Bloc by Bloc is played in rounds and each round is 1 night. The countdown marker starts with 10 nights remaining.  Each night has 2 phases, Nighttime and Sunrise.&#10;&#10;Nighttime: The Nighttime phase is when each faction takes its turn. At the start of a turn, cards are drawn from the Police Ops deck that move and deploy police squads across the city. Higher Police Morale means more cards. Next, the faction rolls action dice and spends those dice to take various actions around the city using their blocs. Each bloc represents an organized group of 5-15 people.&#10;&#10;Sunrise: After each faction has taken its turn, the Reaction card orders police to attack and police vans to move around the city. Next, factions may liberate districts and draw Liberation cards if enough blocs are gathered in those districts. There might also be a meeting to draw more Conditions cards. And don&rsquo;t forget to check if the game has been won! If not, move the countdown forward at the speed of Police Morale, start the next night, and continue playing. If time runs out or any 1 faction has no blocs in the city, all factions lose.&#10;&#10;",

Bring it along on your next adventure!&#10;&#10;The sun is shining, as a light, salty wind sends cottony clouds scudding across the sky. Sandpipers filling their bellies with strange insects, crabs hiding under piles of rocks, seashells washed up on the sand, curling waves that break along the beach. Nature in its simplest beauty.&#10;&#10;One token at a time, create your Seaside with the elements the sea sends your way. The goal of the game is to have the highest stack of tokens.&#10;&#10;How to play:&#10;&#10;Put all tokens in the Bag and mix them up. The Play area is divided into 2 spaces: The sea (central area) and the Seaside (area in front of each player)&#10;&#10;On your turn, draw a token from the Bag, look at it secretly, choose the side that interests you and apply its effect. Once you have chosen the side of the token you'd like to play, it will remain like that for the rest of the game.&#10;&#10;Once you've applied the token's effect, your turn is over; pass the Bag to the player on your left. &#10;&#10;&#10;There are two types of tokens:&#10;&#10;Tokens with a blue design are thrown into the sea&#10;&#10;Tokens with a white design are placed on your Seaside&#10;&#10;If you pick a token with a blue design and throw it into the sea, you immediately take another turn. Your turn ends when you pick a token with a white design and put it on your Seaside.&#10;&#10;The key to the game lies in the interaction among the various elements of Seaside&rsquo;s ecosystem. The Sandpiper allows you to fetch Isopods from the Sea. The more Beaches you have, the more Shells you can collect from the Sea. Having one Rock does nothing, but the second one you place allows you to collect all the Crabs from the Sea... and even steal one from another player! Finally, Waves wash across the Beach tiles and flip them over.&#10;&#10;As soon as the bag is empty, the game is over. Stack up all the tokens from your Seaside, and the player with the highest stack wins!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Board shows an oval track of six lanes, straightforward in straights but graduated on the curves.  Although dice play a part in the game there is plenty of room for skillful maneuvering in the course of each race, which can be from 5 furlongs to 1 1/4 miles.  An important part of the game is provided by certain marked squares: if you can get your horse to stop on one of these it can overtake one horse ahead of it in the same line, which can be vital considering that only two swerves are permitted in each turn (only one if the jockey is an apprentice).  Every horse has a distinctive racing pattern (slow or fast starter, stayer or fader etc.) represented by a set of numbers, one for each turn.  These numbers are added to a single dice throw (common to all the horses), so that the speed of each race can vary substantially.  There are many other interesting factors too numerous to describe in a short review.  Odds on each horse are pre-set and depend largely on the number patterns described above.&#10;&#10;Originally released as part of the 3M Sports Games line.&#10;&#10;",

Goals are revealed simultaneously, so you may or may not be in competition with another player for the same cards during the round.  And you can't choose a goal you've already chosen, so things can get pretty tough especially on the last hand, where no matter what cards you're dealt, you *have* to go for whichever of the five goals you haven't done already.&#10;&#10;Since the game is always exactly five rounds, it lasts a good dependable half an hour every time.&#10;&#10;",

You compete against rival mystics, each of you deciding when to cast the most powerful spells to move through the forest most cunningly to secure the best collection. Each turn you decide which items are most valuable to you and when to hold the other mystics back.&#10;&#10;Through two rounds (twilight and moonlight), players compete to collect the strongest sets of magical items like firebird feathers, creature skulls, glowing mushrooms, mysterious eggs, and rare herbs. These items have value when collected in specific sets, but can also be combined to fulfill recipes needed for concoctions, scoring you even more prestige!&#10;&#10;Each round you begin with a set of numbered tokens that represent your spell strengths. These tokens are used to cast spells and bid on a grid of items (and special actions) on the forest floor. Once you cast a spell, your rival mystics will have an opportunity to cast a more powerful spell onto an adjacent item, hoping to compel it towards them and prevent you from collecting what you need! As the forest is explored, different conditions of magical control will restrict pathways, leading to strategic situations in which players can &quot;corner cast&quot; and secure multiple items with less powerful spells. If your spell casting comes up short, you can always make an offering to the forest sprites, magical mice that have their own cache of treasures they may share with you, giving you further options to expand your collection.&#10;&#10;The set-up of the forest grid and twilight and moonlight goals, along with concoction cards and special player abilities in each game, provide great variability so that no two games of Nocturne will play out the same. Different spatial goals and situations will necessitate different strategies and tactics to outwit your opponents in this highly interactive and unique spatial bidding game!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The deck consists of pirate cards, which allow to attack opponent, draw more cards and perform many more profitable actions, and treasure cards which allow to buy more and better pirates.

Players own trading settlements on islands in the Pacific and must attempt to get trade routes established in order to make those settlements score points. Trade routes are established by connecting various different shipping companies, represented by different colored Clippers, to land at your island. The more Clippers that land at an island, the more points a settlement there will be worth.&#10;&#10;Players control creation of trade routes by six trading companies by laying down wooden sticks that advance the appropriate clipper. The different islands have point values, as well as a set amount of potential settlements and a number of ports that clippers can land at. Throughout the game phases, players will have to manage placing their settlements, claiming option cards, laying track segments, and adding new clippers. With no luck involved, it is a difficult task to both advance the clippers in the way you want without alerting your opponents to your plans. Successful play heavily involves taking advantage of situations your opponents leave open and capitalizing on ports that they make valuable.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, an island will be worth its value multiplied by the number of different companies that have landed at it. Duplicate landings by the same company do not increase the score. For every settlement you have on an island, you will score points. For instance, an island with a base value of 5 that has 3 different companies will be worth 15 points. If you have placed 2 settlements there, it will earn you 30 points.
