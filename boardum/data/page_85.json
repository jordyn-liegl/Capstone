    "description": "Cruel Necessity is a solitaire game simulating the military, political, and religious struggles of the English Civil Wars. You attempt to stop the advance of four armies bent on destroying Parliament and Puritanism, whom you represent. Simply holding on to London is not enough; you must also suppress the enemies of Puritanism, Parliamentary Government, and English domination.&#10;&#10;There are civil wars going on not just in England, but in Scotland and Ireland too; and each will have varying impact on the play of the game at different times.&#10;&#10;The title comes from the purported response to the beheading of King Charles by his implacable foe, Oliver Cromwell, who remarked that this act of regicide was a &ldquo;Cruel necessity.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Deluxe edition changes:&#10;This is a deluxe new edition of the classic solo game. It will be printed with super high quality components.  The box, board, and counters will be thick and mounted.  The player aids will have the largest font possible and be on nice quality card stock.&#10;&#10;The values, and thus the impacts, of the Achievement cards have been changed. Errata from the classic VPG edition has also been included.&#10;&#10;Game contents:&#10;One full color Rulebook including designer's Notes&#10;One large mounted game board&#10;One Player Aid&#10;75 cards&#10;One sheet of thick, two-sided, multi-shaped game pieces&#10;One blue (Parliamentary) 6-sided die&#10;One red (Royalist) 6-sided die&#10;&#10;",

Everyone from the highest aristocrat to the lowliest gang boss strives to gain the support of the guilds &mdash; but to get this means bribery, skullduggery, and knowledge of the four most powerful and influential figures in the city. Knowing when to strike requires cunning and prudence. News travels fast, and no guild wants to become infamous...unless of course they can profit from it!&#10;&#10;In Pot-de-Vin, the goal is to collect sets of different guild symbols by winning rounds and claiming the cards of your opponents. Gather the right amount of symbols to gain the most points. Jokers can be added to a guild of your choice, but watch out for the Pot-de-Vin (13); if you don't collect them all, then they will hurt you in the end.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Spell words, flip your typewriter keys, and build combos in this new game in the Paperback series. This travel-ready game comes in a small box, and can even be stored in the included zipper bag. Acrylic tiles instead of cards mean even a bit of rain or ocean spray won't dampen your fun.&#10;&#10;Every turn, you will spell a word with the tiles in front of you. Use all your starting tiles in the word to send a tile to your scoring stack. And at the end of each round you'll grab a shiny new tile for yourself from the offer. Since you can only take a tile from the offer after your turn, you can start spelling out your next word while the other players take their turns.&#10;&#10;Sounds simple enough. But there's one more twist: every time you spell a word, you'll flip all the tiles in that word, revealing new letters and a completely new puzzle.&#10;&#10;The tiles you take might have potent abilities that can be recharged by using a letter in your word to flip them back over, or you might grab tiles that help you score set collection points at the end of the game. Other tiles are bigrams that let you claim common vowels, and sometimes a tile just has a real tough letter that can score for real big points.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The Mexican dictator, Santa Anna, responded in 1836 by recapturing the Alamo and overrunning much of Texas until he was captured at the battle of San Jacinto.&#10;&#10;Texas Glory is a strategy wargame that brings this exciting period in history to life. Men like Houston, Austin, Crockett, and Bowie play key roles in the Texan struggle to defeat superior Mexican forces with a small but heroic army.&#10;&#10;The game is challenging and exciting for both players.

    "description": "Kickstarter Link: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/compassgames/commands-and-colors-tricorne-jacobite-rising?ref=czkfi9&#10;&#10;By design, Jacobite Rising is not overly complex. In a battle scenario, two players will command either the Jacobite forces or the units of the Government army. There are 13 battle scenarios in the game. A scenario&rsquo;s battle notes state which player takes the first turn and players will alternate taking turns thereafter until one player reaches the number of Victory Banners indicated in the scenario&rsquo;s victory conditions.&#10;&#10;The Jacobite Rising battlefield game board has a hex grid of 13 hexes wide by 11 hexes deep. The battlefield is divided into three sections by two dotted lines, giving each player a Left Flank Section, a Center Section and a Right Flank Section. Where the dotted line cuts through a hex, the hex is considered to be part of both the flank section and the center section. Terrain Tiles represent a range of terrain features and are placed on the battlefield to recreate the historical scenario setting.&#10;&#10;A Command card is played each turn by the active player to order troops on a player&rsquo;s side to move, battle, or do something special. The mix of units both players may have under their commands include; regular infantry, highland infantry, lowland infantry, militia infantry, battle cavalry, light cavalry, trained artillery, light artillery and leaders. Units are represented by a group of 4 blocks in a hex and a single block represents a leader. Units and leaders may only move and battle when given an order. During a turn when units are battling, the battle dice will resolve combat quickly and efficiently and when the last block of an opposition unit or leader block is eliminated, a player will gain one Victory Banner. Again the number of banners needed to win is detailed in a scenario&rsquo;s victory conditions.&#10;&#10;In a Jacobite Rising Tricorne battle, unit morale is one of the main thematic concepts, as it was historically. It is possible that units which have taken few-- or even no-- losses will run off the battefield at the first combat, which will definitely keep players on the edge of their command chairs during an entire battle.&#10;&#10;To further emphasize the differences in battlefield doctrine between the Highland Clans and Government forces, each army has its own unique deck of Combat cards. These cards represent a mix of unit training, abilities, and surprising actions that take place during the course of a battle.&#10;&#10;As with other Commands &amp; Colors games, the scale of the game fluctuates, which allows players to effectively portray some of the larger historical Jacobite Rising battles, like Culloden and Falkirk, as well as smaller size skirmish actions. The 13 battle scenarios in the game present a stylized battlefield map that emphasize the important terrain features and highlights the historical deployment of forces in scale with the game system. Still the tactics of the period, that players will need to execute to gain victory, conform remarkably well to the advantages and limitations inherent to the various armies of the day and the battlefield terrain features on which they fought.&#10;&#10;Here is the list of 13 battles and smaller skirmish actions included with Jacobite Rising:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Killicrankie - 27 July 1689&#10;     Dunkeld - 21 August 1689&#10;     Cromdale - 1 May 1690&#10;     Alness - 10 July 1715&#10;     Sheriffmuir - 13 November 1715&#10;     Glen Shiel - 10 June 1719&#10;     Prestonpans - September 1745&#10;     Clifton - 18 December 1745&#10;     Inverurie - 23 December 1745&#10;     Falkirk (Stage 1) - 17 January 1746&#10;     Falkirk (Stage 2) - 17 January 1746&#10;     Culloden - 16 April 1746&#10;     Culloden (Flanking Move) - 16 April 1746&#10;&#10;&#10;Again, owners of Compass Games The American Revolution Commands &amp; Colors: Tricorne will find many familiar game mechanics in this stand-alone game product, but there are also plenty of new and interesting play concepts, which  add historical depth and will provide even the most veteran Commands &amp; Colors players new experiences and challenges as they are introduced into the world of the Highland Clans in the time of the Jacobite Risings.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

But be aware, this is not the Prussian army of the Seven Years War!&#10;&#10;At Mollwitz (April 10, 1741), King Frederick II has been outmaneuvered by FM Neipperg.  The plodding Prussians must advance over snowy fields to assault the waiting Austrian infantry and escape the entrapment.  The Austrian player, with superior cavalry, must use that cavalry to slow down or distract the Prussian infantry before they devastate their Austrian counterparts.  Each side has their strengths and (weaknesses) and must seek to maximise them to their benefit before time runs out.  And, there is always the possibility that Frederick will flee the battle ...&#10;&#10;At Chotusitz (May 17, 1742), the Austrian army under Prince Charles has again outmaneuvered Frederick and hopes to annihilate the isolated part of his army.  The pressure is on as the Austrians must attack quickly before the bulk of the Prussian army arrives as reinforcements.  This is a finely matched battle with the Austrians as the attackers!&#10;&#10;Both battles are only one map in size with less than the usual number of counters.  Chotusitz is roughly the size of the BAR game of Lobositz whereas Mollwitz has only 2/3 of the counters of Chotusitz.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Choose from one of 8 hilariously bizarre characters, who have been imprisoned on the bottom level of the Dulce Base and have just awoken after a Cryo-Pod malfunction. The players must blast their way through a base full of self strategizing human and non-human enemies, as they attempt to traverse the seven nefarious levels of Dulce and escape to freedom.&#10;&#10;Along the way you&rsquo;ll collect zany items, incredible weapons and level up your characters, while constantly working to keep the alarm from reaching critical levels and releasing the dreaded Man in Black.&#10;&#10;The game is more than just blasting enemies though, as a tale slowly unfolds in the form of story themed Encounter Cards, randomly drawn every time the players enter a new room. The story portion of the card describes the room and what happens to the players while in that room, while the business portion of the card dictates what traps or puzzles and enemies the players must overcome. The Encounter Cards create the feeling of a lived in world and allow for maximum replayability and role-play fun.&#10;&#10;Will you play as Snippy Von Bell, a two-headed mutant cow that can strap machine guns on its back, or Amelia Earhart, a pilot who disappeared in 1937 over the Pacific? Maybe you&rsquo;ll meet a helpful sasquatch or have to decide if you should release an Atlantean fishman from his aquarium cell. Tentacle monsters, robot ninjas, a game of lizard man chess and even a mini black hole await you! Good luck escaping. You&rsquo;re going to need it.&#10;&#10;",

Vampires are, after all, connoisseurs of the very best that (un)life has to offer... Renovate the most imposing rooms of your lair! Fill the halls with ghoulish servants! Drink a fine wine, pose dramatically on the highest tower, and write dreadful poetry! But beware the curious and bold locals that might wander by - perhaps you can invite them in...for a drink?&#10;&#10;Deckula is a darkly-comic card game of high stakes (sorry) where you try to balance a decadent lifestyle with fending off aspiring vampire hunters and looters. It's quick and easy-to-play, with scalable difficulty and a small footprint.&#10;&#10;The objective of the game is to make it to the end of the deck without getting killed by any visitors to the castle. Each turn, you have a simple decision to make - draw a card and decide whether to buy it (adding it to your tableau) or discard it (gaining energy points to purchase future cards). Many cards are worth victory points and most of them feature a variety of tricky effects you can use to defend yourself and manipulate the flow of play. The visitor cards are the exception - they'll instantly enter a 'threat area' and have a couple of nasty effects that can affect your score or even destroy you, if you're not careful. The challenge is playing as many high-scoring cards as possible while still keeping the negative effects of the visitors under control.&#10;&#10;The game ends when you make it to the end of the deck - winning the game and scoring your cards - or when a visitor or other card effect causes you to lose.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;In the 2021 Solitaire Print &amp; Play Contest, Deckula won:&#10;&#10;     1st place in Best Use of Theme&#10;     2nd place in Best Graphic Design&#10;     2nd place in Best New Solo Designer&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Welcome to Dragon Reach, the bustling new frontier settlement in the Realm of Smiteros. The zone portals have just opened, and as we speak the first heroes are braving the Dungeon in search of fame, glory, and level-ups. Besieged monsters lurk on the outskirts of town looking for opportunities to gear themselves up against their new foes.&#10;&#10;For you, this means only one thing: PROFIT! You see, heroes come back with packs full of loot, needing beds and mead and provisions and furry hats. (It&rsquo;s always furry hats. What is up with that?) And monsters will pay top doubloon for anything that might stop the heroes from coming into their dungeon and smiting them straight to the Nameless Realms. (G&rsquo;luck with that, fellas!) For the enterprising merchant who can work both ends of the situation, there are stacks of Vorpal to be made. But you won&rsquo;t be alone. Other merchants are here, moving in on your territory, trying to make the same quick piece of shiny that you are. Competition is the heart of commerce. Or something.&#10;&#10;When the boss monster finally goes down, whoever has the most Vorpal Pieces wins! (I saw that carved in a table at the Merchants&rsquo; Guild, so it must be true.)&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;The game is played in a series of rounds, and each round is separated into two phases:&#10;&#10;1. Town Phase - Players will take turns running Shops, working in the Guildhalls, and crafting artifacts. When the round ends after one player calls for it, the Heroes leave town for their next Dungeon Crawl.&#10;&#10;2. Dungeon Crawl Phase - The Heroes enter the Dungeon to defeat enemies and level up, receive Loot, and while this is happening you and your cohorts are preparing the town for their &quot;triumphant&quot; return. The Heroes finish by arriving at the Town Gate with backpacks full of Loot and gold, ripe for the picking. This starts the next and round with a new Town Phase.&#10;&#10;The player with the most VPs at the end of the game (after the Boss encounter) wins!&#10;&#10;",

These tokens show either gold (which possibly gives you points at the end of the game) or an animal (which allows you to pass through gates that bear that animal to reach a different landscape). From the third turn on, players use their animal tokens to move their korrigans and pick up more tokens. Each round the player holding the bag draws a rainbow token and places it in one of the rows or columns on the board; this means that the pot of gold won't appear in this row or column in the final part of the game.&#10;&#10;Once the gold is finally placed on the game board, players have a final round in which they try to reach the pot with their korrigans. If a player reaches the pot with one korrigan, he scores 10 points and if both of his korrigans reach the pot he scores 15 points. Whoever has the highest score wins!&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Between 1500 and 600 BC, Asia Minor and the Mediterranean witnessed the rise and fall of several mighty empires. Often the birth of one empire precipitated the death of another. How could a small people like the Judeans establish an empire when located between such giants as Egypt and Assyria? Why did some Empires endure for centuries while others lasted only a few generations? Chariot Lords shows you the how and why.&#10;&#10;Each Lord controls between 5 and 6 nations, some strong, others weak, each with varying goals and objectives - indeed some of these countries may not even exist at the same time. Players compete against one another to achieve the victory criteria for their empires. Nations quickly become rivals, involving them in death struggles over expansion. Each turn (90 years) will see new countries come to the fore, while established empires struggle to levy reinforcements and arrange alliances. A fine line must be walked between conserving one's forces and expanding one's empire. Too much expansion will see your resources spread thin and possibly swept away by a new emerging empire, but not enough aggression will see your empire fail to garner sufficient victory points to win.&#10;&#10;Armies are of a mix of foot and mounted units, along with the occasional leader of note. It is not enough to conquer -- you must be able to keep what you have taken. The winner will be the one who has the most victory points after all the armies have had their moment on the stage. It is up to you to determine whether your empire will be relegated to the dustbin of history, or whether others will hail you as...The Chariot Lord.&#10;&#10;Contents: &#10;&#10;    8 pages of Rules, 4 of notes and commentary &#10;    1 hard-backed map &#10;    140 3/4 inch square counters/markers &#10;    170 5/8 inch square counters &#10;    4 victory point charts with combat charts on reverse &#10;    4 nation force arrival charts &#10;    1 master nation force arrival chart&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Evade the ruthless Wind Pirates as you collect influence with the powerful Sky Guild. Manipulate the commodity market using your powers of persuasion. Through clever trades and resourceful captaining, you can seize the title of Master of the Sky Guild!&#10;&#10;Each round of Sky Traders takes place in two main phases. In the first phase, players sail their ships and perform actions. To start, each player draws an Ill Wind card, which has a variety of effects that can help or hinder players. The Sky Patrol could attack you for carrying contraband, or the Wind Pirates might try to board your vessel in hopes of plundering valuable goods. If you're lucky, you'll stumble upon a treasure map that leads to riches. It's all up to fate when you draw from the Ill Wind deck.&#10;&#10;You'll add new members to your crew to gain various improvements. Skymen lend their blades to fight off Wind Pirate attacks. Other shipmates can help you earn more money when selling goods. Some crewmembers even make it possible to disregard the results of an Ill Wind card. You'll want to be judicious when hiring crew since they take up valuable space on the ship that could be used for trade goods.&#10;&#10;If your skyship requires repairs or refueling, visit a city. While there, line the ship's cargo hold with valuable textiles, spices, or even jewels, then deliver the goods to another city where entrepreneurs will pay large sums of money for the items. Make sure to stock up on goods when the price is low and sell them off when their value increases.&#10;&#10;In the second phase of each turn, the Guild Council takes place. During this round, players deliberate with each other in hopes of persuading their peers to help influence the price of goods. Strike a deal with your peers and you could force a surge in the value of the commodities you own, but if you've angered your rivals, they may choose to team up and devalue the wares you are selling.&#10;&#10;At the end of the Guild Council phase, each captain also has the opportunity to purchase Influence, which increases his ability to control prices and moves him a step closer to victory. Influence is expensive, but you cannot become the Master of the Sky Guild without it.&#10;&#10;As captain of your own skyship, you'll have to decide each turn how to best service your needs. Buying cargo at one port and delivering it to another city where the goods are highly desired is a great way to turn a profit. However, a captain also must consider hiring new crew, checking the ship&rsquo;s phlogiston (fuel for skyships) levels, repairing damage sustained in pirate attacks, and undertaking other important tasks to keep the ship running at peak performance. When money is tight, haul toxic sludge or collect minerals from the countryside to make some quick money.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "A royal family with a penchant for towers has decreed the builders of the kingdom &ndash; the players &ndash; to perk up the kingdom's skyline with new spires. In answer to their call, players compete to catch the eye of the royal family and ultimately, the title of Royal Builder. Players must be careful though. If they build a spire taller than the royal palace, they'll be penalized instead of praised.&#10;&#10;Spires combines hand management, a unique take on trick-taking, and set collection into a 25-minute game. Players compete for cards in different markets to try to build out their tableaus.&#10;&#10;Every player aims to fill their tableau with spires of each type but must be careful not to add more than three of any one type of card. Once the spire exceeds three cards, all cards of that type become a penalty to their final score. Competing for cards can be tricky as rival builders can force you to take cards that push you over the three-card limit, but not to worry! You can also win cards that allow you to manage your tableau.&#10;&#10;The builder with the most points, including spires and bonuses (special cards, symbol majorities, etc.), wins!&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Reviving Kathmandu is a bidding and set collection game for 1-6 players. In the game, players are builders who travel to Nepal. They&rsquo;ll compete to earn the title of Most Respected Architect in Kathmandu.&#10;&#10;Bid on construction materials (cards). Then collect those cards and use them to build the most prestigious Buddhas, Shrines, Stupas and Pagodas (&ldquo;Monuments&rdquo;). You&rsquo;ll score points for your monuments, for achieving special objectives, and for paying special attention to color. The architect who achieves the most points will win the game.&#10;&#10;HOW TO PLAY&#10;The game is played over 8 rounds. Each round has 3 phases: Bid, Collect, and Build. Players work through these 3 phases, in this order. Each phase is explained in greater detail in the rulebook. But, generally, players will:&#10;&#10;- BID: Starting with the first player and continuing clockwise, each player must place 1 coin of their choice face-down onto one of the bid spots on the playmat. Each bid spot targets 2 cards within the same row or column.&#10;&#10;- COLLECT: Players flip their coins and determine who won each card. Determine the winner for each card using this order:&#10;  1. The only bidder&#10;  2. Highest bidder&#10;  3.If tied, the player whose coin is closest to the card&#10;  4. If still tied, the player whose coin is on the long edge of the card&#10;Then each player collects 2 cards total to their hands &mdash; taking from the Market and/or the red deck.&#10;&#10;- BUILD: Players use as many cards as they want from their hands to build Monuments. To add to a Monument, slide an appropriate card under the previous one, revealing the section that continues the Monument. Once a Monument has all its required sections, it is &ldquo;complete.&rdquo; Buddhas are considered complete immediately after they are built. When you complete a Monument, immediately score points for completing it&#10;&#10;The game has 8 rounds. After every 4 rounds, each player will only have 1 coin left. When this happens, players either convert their last coin to points or buy 1 discarded card.&#10;&#10;MISSIONS: Players may complete various objectives for bonus points. Each Mission contains 4 objectives&mdash;to complete a Buddha, a Shrine, a Stupa, and/or a Pagoda with sections matching the color(s) shown on the Mission.&#10;&#10;GAME END:&#10;- Discard all cards left in your hands and discard piles.&#10;- Score points for the topmost card of any incomplete Monuments.&#10;- Score color bonuses (if any) for your completed Monument.&#10;&#10;WINNING: The player with the most points becomes the most well-respected architect, and therefore wins the game!&#10;&#10;Reviving Kathmandu is the second game in the Lemery Games Globetrotter Game Series, after Chili Mafia.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

How many points on each turn depends on how good you are at spotting sequences and by playing a set which will create multiple combinations on the board.

You can't always plan in advance though as the tiles stack, so a sequence you had in mind may disappear when your opponents take their turn.&#10;&#10;The strategy is even more intense when you try team play mode, work with a partner to plan your sets together. You'll work hard to maximize points, help your partner create sets, and gift each other bonus points. Careful how many points you score because the game ends when the first player crosses the finish line, but being in first place doesn't decide the win; it's the team that avoids finishing last when the game ends!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Everything in the game centers on Medinaat al-Salaam, the Jewel of the Desert, a sprawling city where different factions vie for control. As of the Awakening set there are 12 factions in the game. A very short description of them:&#10;&#10;Assassins &ndash; You guessed it, assassins. ;)&#10;Moto &ndash; Mongols, likes to raid&#10;Senpet &ndash; Ancient Egyptians&#10;Ashalan &ndash; Immortal alien star gazers&#10;Qabal &ndash; Rebellious Jinn summoners&#10;Ebonites &ndash; Crusaders&#10;Jackal &ndash; Evil cultists&#10;Celstial Alliance &ndash; Djinns and more djinns&#10;Dahab &ndash; Merchants faction&#10;Ivory Kingdom &ndash; Evil Indian Cult&#10;Ra&rsquo;Shari &ndash; Romani&#10;Yodatai &ndash; Latin Romans&#10;&#10;The city and the river that runs through it is the only source of water in the desert and thus the one who controls the city and the water controls the desert. The city is ruled by the dread Caliph and her (yes, she&rsquo;s female) semi-undead followers. Much is going on in the city and the story evolves through the sets.&#10;&#10;There are four sets all in all and each set had a &quot;bug&quot; on them to make it easy to identify what set a certain card came from. The &quot;bug&quot; is a small symbol in the lower right corner of the card just in front of the Illustrator name. Faction included in that set listed as well:&#10;&#10;Shadow of the Tyrant (156 cards) &ndash; No marking being the first set. (Assassins, Moto, Senpet)&#10;Secrets and Lies (104 cards) &ndash; A small Maltese cross. (Ashalan, Qabal)&#10;Black Hand, Black Heart (104 cards) &ndash; Four small rectangles. (Ebonites, Jackal)&#10;The Awakening (464 cards) &ndash; A new moon. (Celestial Alliance, Dahab, Ivory Kingdoms, Ra&rsquo;Shari, Yodatai)&#10;&#10;These markings are hard to spot on some cards.

The copilot must now take the lead, but other crewmembers distrust him. The crew believes there are infiltrators amongst them. But who? A skirmish occurs. Will all infiltrators get exposed?&#10;&#10;Each crewmember either belongs to the honest crew, or is among the few infiltrators who know one another. At the start you receive 3 identity cards, 2 or 1 honest and 1 or 2 infiltrator. The card you have double, determines your identity. You place these secret cards, mixed, face down in front of you. Then each player looks at 1 card per neighbor. By placing a knowledge tile at a card, you show (or perhaps lie about) what you see. You'll never see more than 1 of another player's 3 cards. So you must combine your own knowledge with the claims of others! But who can you trust?? In order to keep from being unmasked, the infiltrators will naturally act as if they're trying to deduce who might betray the crew.&#10;&#10;During skirmishes, some crewmembers will receive first the &quot;Benefit of the Doubt&quot;, then they can graduate to a status of &quot;Reliable&quot;, and then one of these two reliable crewmembers will become the new Captain. This Captain must start to form a final crew that excludes the infiltrators from access to the cockpit.&#10;&#10;With each skirmish, a player sees one identity card held by another player and shares this knowledge (but possibly lies). So each player knows cards self and must value the claims of others. With all players knowing different things, the deductive logic gets deeper and deeper as you theorize about who is who, while also holding possible lies in mind! Will you make it back to the ground safely?&#10;&#10;",

The game board is a modular board built of hex tiles representing a landscape with fields of flowers and hornet nests of various sizes. The players have an identical deck of action cards and each card can be used multiple times. Each game turn, players secretly pick an action card that is revealed simultaneously with the other players. The actions are resolved in the numerical order of the action cards, with each player allocating the action to either one of their hornets on the game board. The hornets compete to collect nectar from the flower fields that is in turn used to produce honey in the nests. The winner of each hornet nest is resolved in a pre-determined order, with the winner being the player with the most honey in the nest. The game is won immediately by conquering three nests or by having won two nests by the end of the game with the highest aggregate amount of honey produced. The nature of the various action cards ensures high player interaction, causes a need for pre planning a number of turns ahead and allows the execution of cunning tactical moves. The easily comprehensible rules, variable game set-up and eye catching artwork with a cheerful theme facilitate an enduring and pleasant gaming experience.&#10;&#10;Box back text:&#10;Hornet is a stinging tactical boardgame for the entire family in which players need to anticipate the moves of their opponents and at times also bluff a bit.

New Zealand and Australia were the first to issue the challenge, but soon after Scotland, South Africa, and the United States joined in. Then Spain, France, Germany, Italy, Greece, and even Brazil intervened. England proudly refused to be forced into this dispute and proposed a worldwide racing championship be held in the Suffolk countryside in order to establish who were the world's supreme sheep farmers. Thus, the sheep race became an incredible and fascinating reality...&#10;&#10;In The Sheep Race, players must place bets on three races, with six sheep participating in each race. Each sheep starts with a number of &quot;breath&quot; cubes (in three colors) on it, along with numbers for three speeds of movement: trot, walk, and gallop.&#10;&#10;On a player's turn, he rolls the two dice &ndash; one a normal d6 and the other having values 0-0-0-1-2-3 &ndash; then moves the sheep in the appropriate lane, with a 7 or 8 moving the sheep in the outer two lanes and a 9 moving the lazy sheep at the back of the pack. When you move a sheep, you choose one of the three types of movement, advance the sheep the indicated number of spaces, and remove the appropriate breath cubes required &ndash; or you make the sheep rest so that it recovers two blue breath cubes.&#10;&#10;If a sheep hits the &quot;end zone&quot; &ndash; the final five spaces of a lane &ndash; with no cubes on it, then the sheep is exhausted and can't move or rest again. The race ends when three sheep reach the finish line or when all the sheep are exhausted. The first three positions pay off for those who bet on them, even if one or more of those positions contains an exhausted sheep.&#10;&#10;Players place three bets in the first two races (two secret and one visible) and two bets in the final race (both secret). Whoever collects the most in bets wins!&#10;&#10;With the advanced rules, players choose which sheep to move each time and the game lasts only one race, with players betting on the final order of all the sheep. Sheep sometimes get blocked and can move again only when passed by the flock leader.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "18DO-Dortmund is a strategic economy game, which reflects the development of the most important industries in Dortmund during the 19th century.&#10;&#10;Dortmund has been a town of beer brewers since the medieval age. About 1840 the first underground mining started and the first steel mill has been built. The connection with the German railway net pushed the industrial development of Dortmund furthermore. The expansion of coal mines and steel mills led to a population increase. From the latter the Dortmund breweries benefited as the demand for beer boosted. At the end of the 19th century the Dortmund breweries used conditioned cars to transport the Dortmund Export beer by railway to distant regions.&#10;&#10;In 18DO-Dortmund the players are investors who invest in both, breweries and railway corporations. Each player starts with a private brewery. In addition every player may found a railway corporation. Coal mines and steel mills have a passive role only, but their locations have an impact on the game&rsquo;s development. All breweries are located in the hex &ldquo;Dortmund City&rdquo;. They produce and supply beer and during the course of the game they improve their brewery equipment in order to scope with the increasing requirements of the beer market which a separate element of the game. The railway corporations are more dynamic. From their starting field at the border of the map they lay tracks to the coal mines and steel mills. On this tracks they run their trains virtually and achieve income according to the value of the hexes which are part of their trains&rsquo; routes. When connecting the locations of coal mines and steel mills with the railway network the demand for beer will be increased. This reflects that the coal mines/steels mills with a railway link are able to increase their capacities and the consequently needed higher workforce will trigger an increase of beer consumption. Later in the game the breweries start shipping beer by using the transport capacity of the railway corporations. In order to do so the train of a railway corporation must run a route that leads from the &ldquo;Dortmund City&rdquo; hex to one of the red off-board destination hexes.&#10;&#10;While the railway companies start the game as corporations the brewery corporations will be founded later during the game. For this purpose private breweries may be converted into brewery corporations.  In order to give an owner/director of a brewery more room for decisions there are special function tokens which will give each brewery specific advantages.&#10;&#10;When a corporation pays dividends the owner of its shares receive the due payment by the bank. In addition the stock value of these shares will be increased. At the end of games all players accumulated their possessions&rsquo; which consists of their private cash plus the value of their share portfolio.  This richest player will win!&#10;&#10;Description by the author&#10;&#10;",

He fancied himself an adventurer and often rode saddled atop his turtle through the Great Wood to spy on the big folk, bringing back to the village tales both strange and wonderful.&#10;&#10;On one such adventure, Rowan returned to the village with a tale that captivated them all: chiseled castles, towering windmills, plaster dragons, and tidy green lawns under a glittering and majestic sign reading &ldquo;Mini-Golf.&rdquo; The gnomes set to work immediately, intent on recreating this verdant wonderland.&#10;&#10;After a week of diligent trimming, digging, and weeding, Helna&rsquo;s golden Acorn Trophy was sitting atop a pedestal beyond the last hole. The course at Stottingham Shire was open and the game was ready to begin!&#10;&#10;Overview.&#10;Just like in the big folk game of miniature golf, you and your fellow gnomes are doing your best to recreate the game by earning the lowest score. Over the course of three rounds, you&rsquo;ll be collecting and arranging cards into a 3 by 3 grid.&#10;&#10;Drive your score as low as possible by placing Negative value cards in your grid or by creating rows or columns of 3 identical Positive value cards, which will earn you Negative points equal to the matching value of the set (example: a row of three 6&rsquo;s would earn you -6 points).&#10;&#10;As soon as one player has no more face-down cards in their grid, each other player takes one final turn and the round is over. After three rounds, total your scores and find out which gnome has won the game. Celebrate their victory by carrying them around your home and cheering their name!&#10;&#10;It's a tee-rific time you'll never fore-get!&#10;&#10;",

If any non-active player notices that both players have a Yuck symbol at the same time, she can yell &quot;Chop!&quot; and that ends their turn immediately, with the dice passing to the next players.&#10;&#10;Whoever completes a dish first keeps that card, and the first player to collect 4-6 cards (depending on the number of players) wins.&#10;&#10;",

Now you must find your way home across the empty vastness of space so that your MomDad can ground you for the rest of your mortal existence. Maybe you could fix the saucer, or flag down a passing spacecraft, but in the meantime you'd better make sure you don't meet any pesky Earthlings...&#10;&#10;Blorg in the Midwest is a solitaire deck-builder story game in just 9 cards. Your hand contains a single location card that determines where you are, plus a card for each item you are carrying (such as your trusty memory eraser zappo gun). Each turn you may move to another location by swapping your location card for another, or obtain a new item card from those available by combining the required icons from cards in your hand. In the second part of your turn a scrolling time line determines a range of events that you must avoid or mitigate, such as meeting the farmer or his wife.&#10;&#10;If you can obtain the right items you can repair your saucer, or signal a passing spacecraft. But if you are seen and reported then this sets in train a series of events leading eventually to your capture and vivisection by the FBI. So tread softly, choose your actions wisely, and above all don't get caught.&#10;&#10;&#10;Released in the May 2018 Board Game of the Month Club $10+ package.&#10;&#10;",

If the die is showing an open eye picture, the player can perform an action.&#10;&#10;After finishing the monster turn, the players then take a turn as elves, trying to find colored socks in chests and cabinets on the game board.

The game includes an accurate order of battle and detailed game map. The map encompasses the primary theater of war from Peterwardein in the north, Sarajevo in the west, to Ni&scaron; in the south-east.&#10;&#10;The game system used is the same as found in 1914: Offensive &#195;&#160; outrance (GMT). The game has a playtested, concise, well written and organized 24-page rules booklet. &#10;1914, Serbien mu&szlig; sterbien includes three sceanrios. Two short scenarios and a Grand Campaign scenario that covers the period from the initial Austro-Hungarian invasion in August to exhaustion a stalemate in December.&#10;&#10;The game-design goal for 1914, Serbien mu&szlig; sterbien is to produce an enjoyable game from which players can learn a great deal about the campaign and the geography of the theater of war. The result is a game that the &quot;WW1 enthusiast&quot; must have and that a gaming connoisseur will enjoy.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;The combat units are primarily Divisions and Brigades. The map&rsquo;s scale is 1:500,000. Each hex is approximately 8 kilometers across, with the corresponding area being roughly 6475 hectares (or 16000 acres). Each game turn represents from two to four days of time depending on the season.&#10;&#10;",

Vivid colors mark the way to intricate tiles zigging and zagging through the green. Within the flowers lies the key to greater meaning. An explanation for all things unknown...&#10;&#10;In Umbra Via, players compete to control and complete the most cunning paths. Reach into your bag to select wooden flowers, then place them on your secret board in the order of the paths you want most. But when players reveal their choices, things get delightfully tricky. Experience the magic of Umbra Via and find out why this award-winning design belongs on any table.&#10;&#10;In more detail, at the start of each round four tiles are revealed from the deck, with each tile showing part of a path, e.g., a straight line, a curve, or a T. Players secretly draw three cubes from their bag and place them on spaces on their personal board corresponding to these tiles. They all reveal their choices, move their cubes to the chosen tiles, then secretly place three more cubes, then move those cubes to the tiles. Whichever tile ends up with the fewest cubes on it is placed in the 4x4 grid first, maintaining the same orientation, by the player who bid the most cubes on that tile. (Some cubes in your bag are worth two cubes during the bidding phase, but are then removed from the tile and returned to your bag prior to placement.) Then the next tile is placed on the grid, and so on.&#10;&#10;When you place a tile, if all the &quot;open&quot; ends of that path are cut off &mdash; whether by the edge of the board or other tiles &mdash; you count how many cubes each player has on the path. The player with the most placed cubes retrieves &quot;double-bidding&quot; cubes from the reserve equal to the number of tiles in the path, adding these cubes and all other cubes to their bag. The player with the secondmost cubes on the path retrieves half this many &quot;double-bidding&quot; cubes, and so on. After removing and returning all the cubes on this path, remove the tiles from the grid, placing them in a discard pile.&#10;&#10;As soon as a player has retrieved all of their &quot;double-bidding&quot; cubes from the reserve, they win!&#10;&#10;",

You can choose 2 actions per turn, and you will either put a recipe card in the oven, peek into an oven (in case you forgot what you started cooking), turn up the heat (and advance the track on the back of a recipe card), or take a recipe out of the oven (putting the card into play). With these actions you will bake new treats that are used to either reduce your opponent&rsquo;s health, heal yourself, or allow special actions. When a player&rsquo;s health is reduced to zero, they lose the game, and their opponent wins.&#10;&#10;",

Speak your answer. Now shake the box containing two of the numbered rocks. Hold your breath and open the box. Is the answer you gave correct, or have the rocks guessed the right number? Advance either the human pawn or the rock one space on the scorecard. It's a best-of-three challenge, and the chance at beating these clever little pebbles isn't as easy as you've hoped. Pass the challenge to the next victim and take some time to yourself. One round of gameplay takes all of five minutes; the shame lasts decidedly longer.&#10;&#10;",

You may draw three cubes from the cloth supply bag, then add two to your personal supply, placing the other one in the general supply. You may take all resources of one type from the general supply. (You may hold only eight resources at a time in your supply, so if after drawing or taking you have more than eight resources, you must return some to the general supply.) You may build a level of the wonder or a building by paying its resource cost from your supply; your workers mark individual buildings as you build them, unlocking abilities. Finally, you may sell pairs of matching goods to the supply in exchange for coins. Coins can be used as a wild resource, but they also appear in the cost of some wonders. Resources sold or used to build are returned to the supply bag.&#10;&#10;In games of four or more players, players may also trade. Trading occurs off-turn, that is, it can involve anyone except the active player. You may negotiate and trade freely with other players, but you must stop negotiating once you receive the supply bag and become the active player. The longer you spend on your turn, the more opportunity your opponents have to make deals.&#10;&#10;The first player to complete their wonder wins!&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Like the first edition of the Dungeons and Dragons Miniatures Game, players pit their warbands against each other on a battle map. Warbands consist of models, each with their own respective characteristics and points values.  A typical warband consists of 200 points worth of models, with a maximum model count of 10.&#10;&#10;The mechanics has been revised and streamlined, though the overall structure remains. The game has been updated to correspond with the change from 3rd to 4th Ed. Dungeons and Dragons Roleplaying Game.&#10;&#10;The three sets released for this game were Dungeons of Dread, Against the Giants and Demonweb. Each is a set of 60 figures, with 8 random figures in each pack, Giants included huge figures. A fourth set, Feywild, was announced but not released. The Starter Set released with Dungeons of Dread, contains a rulebook, five fixed models, their stat cards, counters for tracking damage, a twenty-sided die and two double sided battle maps.&#10;&#10;Notable changes in the 2nd Edition:&#10;&#10;     Alignment has been simplified. The &quot;Chaotic&quot; and &quot;Lawful&quot; tags have been removed. Only models considered to be absolutely &quot;Good&quot; or &quot;Evil&quot; are given an alignment.&#10;     Warband building is no longer based on alignment, but on &quot;Factions&quot;. Each model belongs to one or more of four factions. Every model in a warband must share at least one faction.&#10;     Commanders are gone, replaced by champions. Models no longer make morale checks or rout. Models reduced to half damage are &quot;bloodied.&quot; Certain game effects may trigger from this state.&#10;&#10;&#10;Wizards of the Coast is revising all the stat cards from 11 sets of the first edition of the game to make them compatable with the new version of the game. These stats will be available online in PDFs.&#10;&#10;Wizards of the Coast will continue to release miniatures for use with the Dungeons &amp; Dragons Roleplaying game. They have authorized a group of fans to create official stat cards to use these future figures with this minatures game.&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Dungeons and Dragons Miniatures Game&#10;&#10;&#10;Home Page: http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/minis&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Hungarian Rhapsody depicts the Soviet drive into Hungary which led the Red Army into the Vienna  basin. Rumania's defection in August 1944 allowed the Soviets to outflank well defended Axis positions in the Carpathian Mountains through the South. In the process, the German 6th Army was almost destroyed, losing most of its heavy equipment (which explains the relative weakness of the German artillery at the start  of  the campaign). The game begins on 5 October 1944 with the 2nd Ukrainian Front and the 4th Ukrainian Front launching an offensive to isolate the German 8th Army which is still defending an area off-map to the East in the Carpathian Mountains.&#10;&#10;Hungarian Rhapsody allows players to play the two  major Soviet offensives and several smaller scenarios covering the German counter offensives.&#10;&#10;Hungarian Rhapsody is the next game in the award winning Operational Combat System (OCS #18). Players control units ranging from battalions through divisions, making key decisions on the use, objectives, and means of war. The series is based on modern concepts of maneuver warfare and allows players a far more insightful look into how campaigns (large and small) really work.&#10;&#10;Game Turn: Half Week.&#10;Hex: 5 miles / 8 km.&#10;Units: Battalion to Division.&#10;Two 22&quot;x34&quot; maps. &#10;One 8-1/2&quot; x 11&quot; Budapest inset map.&#10;Five (5) one-map scenarios.

The experts choose a word as a guess, and the author translates it into the given script, informing their understanding of the writing system. This goes back and forth until the experts give a word that is translated into the original inscription. The number of guesses represents a score, with players seeking the lowest score possible.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "1777, European visitors arrive in Fiji looking to trade with the locals. The Pacific Islanders have highly valued shrunken head treasures which the players wish to acquire for museums back home. Players offer colored glass beads in exchange, but must participate in the elaborate Fijian KAWA ritual to determine whose bead offers are most auspicious.&#10;&#10;In Fiji players make offerings of colored beads over a series of four rounds. To win a round players aim to have the most or fewest beads of each color. A set of condition and effect cards is laid out for each round which determines who will win extra beads, depending on their offers. Players select the number of beads to offer in a series of three exchanges, after each of which the condition and effect cards are evaluated, distributing additional beads depending on who offered the most or the fewest of each color. At the end of the round shrunken head tokens are awarded depending on whose set of remaining beads best matches the current arrangement of goal cards.&#10;&#10;After each round the goal cards, condition cards and effect cards are replaced. To win players must think ahead to understand whether an offer will likely give them more beads or less, depending on the cards in effect for the round. If players tie for a particular condition, the tied players are cancelled out, leaving the next player to follow the specified effect. This gives the game a rock-scissors-paper like feel where winning the round often depends on guessing how many beads the other players will offer.&#10;&#10;High quality components consist of pleasing plastic beads, iconic card art, and shrunken head tokens that are both charming and macabre. Players must use tactical logic and guesswork to get an edge in this puzzling auction style game.&#10;&#10;",

The face of naval warfare changed forever!&#10;&#10;Harpoon 4 handles all aspects of modern maritime combat: surface, sub-surface, and air. Harpoon 4 is a system of detailed but comprehensible rules covering the many facets of modern naval actions. Consistent rating systems and evaluations of the capabilities of modern naval vessels, aircraft, submarines, and helicopters make it possible to achieve realistic results when simulating known situations, by extension Harpoon 4 also achieves realistic results with hypothetical scenarios. Harpoon 4 can answer questions like:&#10;&#10;Are carriers powerhouses or sitting ducks?&#10;Can transatlantic convoys survive in a modern wartime environment?&#10;In the cat-and-mouse games between US and Russian submarines, which is better?&#10;&#10;Extensive examples in the rules book actually take you through mini engagements that span less than a page of text. The set of die-cut counters included in the game, along with the Quickstart rules, make it possible to take this game home and play a scenario in an evening.&#10;&#10;",

How can you resist?&#10;&#10;In the game, you'll find 4 types of characters: Llamas, Alpacas, Goats, and Rams. The goal is to get 7 animals into your field before your opponents. A task that sounds much simpler than it is.&#10;&#10;There are also magic cards, instant cards and upgrade/downgrade cards.&#10;&#10;Playing certain cards only affect certain types, such as if you play a &quot;Goatmeal Raisin Cookie&quot; or a &quot;Download More RAM.&quot;&#10;&#10;In addition, there is a new mechanic called &quot;Herd Bonus.&quot;  If you get 3 of the same type of character in your Stable (now called a Field) at the same time, you get a Field Advantage!  Think of it like an Upgrade card, except with no Upgrade in your Stable.  Bonus effects range from extra card draw to protection to stealing from your friends.  Be sure to strategize early though- if you don&rsquo;t remember the Herd Bonus when choosing your Baby Animal, you might end up having a baaaad time!&#10;&#10;Plus, each of the instant cards in the deck (equivalent to the Neighs you know) have an added bonus of allowing you to snatch up the card if it belongs to a specific type (ex. if you use the right &quot;Neigh&quot; on a Goat-type card, you can add it to your hand instead of sending it to the discard pile!)&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "(from GMT website:)&#10;&#10;Onward Christian Soldiers is Richard Berg's newest strategic level game, this one focused on one of, if not THE, central events in the Middle Ages - The Crusades. It will allow gamers to replay not only the first three Crusades - the only 3 that focused on what we call The Middle East - but with scenarios that range from a 7-player version of the 1st Crusade to a 3rd Crusade scenario that supposes Frederick Barbarossa didn't drown in Turkey and his immense army reached the Kingdom of Jerusalem pretty much intact.&#10;&#10;Onward Christian Soldiers uses numerous innovative mechanics, including: &#10;&#10;    an Activation system that allows players to choose which leaders/armies they want to use most in a given turn, but not know when they will be available for such use.&#10;    a Movement system with no Movement Allowances or Costs, but a heavy emphasis on Attrition and the ability of commanders to &quot;keep going&quot;. Shop 'til ya Drop . . . &#10;    Combat mechanics that put a major, detailed emphasis on sieges and ravaging the surrounding areas, but still allow for the predilections of the various armies in field battles (such as the famous Frankish Heavy Cavalry Charge), as well as the abilities of their commanders . . . men like the great initial Crusaders, such as Raymond, Bohemond, Godfrey and Tancred, King Louis VII of France (and his troublesome wife, the famous Eleanor of Aquitaine), Frederick Barbarossa (if he stays away from the pool), the dangerous Nur ad-Din, the magnificent Saladin, and the one Christian the Muslims feared more than anyone, Richard Lionheart.&#10;    Movement and attrition go hand in hand in this game. Leaders may move as far as they want&#10;    The game uses three sets of cards (110 cards total). Each of the four Crusader factions -- Northern Franks, Southern Franks, Sicilian Normans, Germans -- and three Muslim factions -- Northern Syrians, Southern Syrians, Mosul Turks -- has three or four Leader cards, which the players secretly &quot;purchase&quot; at the beginning of the Game-Turn to create the Activation Deck that determines which leader goes next. In addition, there are two Event Decks - one for the Crusaders and one for the Muslims -- through which a variety of random events occur, ranging from taking cities via treachery to suffering added attrition through oppressive heat.&#10;    Normally, each Leader controls armies only from its own faction. However, a simple set of multi-faction rules controls situations in which either side wishes to combine their armies into larger forces, mostly for the sake of sieges against major cities. The Siege of Antioch, which usually happens early in the game, often requires such an army. The multi-faction rules particularly come into their own during multi-player games; here you can expect to see players bickering over who controls the combined forces, an important point considering that whoever is in charge when the city falls gains control over the city. If attacked while combined, the players of a multi-faction force have 30 seconds to decide who's in charge: if they don't, they defend using a mediocre formation.&#10;&#10;&#10;COUNTERS: 876 full color counters&#10;MAP: One 22&quot;x34&quot; full-color map&#10;CARDS: 110 Cards&#10;OTHER:&#10;&#10;     Two six-sided dice&#10;     First Crusade Rule book&#10;     Second and Third Crusade Rule book&#10;     Playbook&#10;     4 Player Aid cards &#10;&#10;&#10;DESIGNER Richard Berg&#10;DEVELOPER Neil Randall&#10;ART DIRECTOR Rodger B.

    "description": "Mermaid Rain is a Japanese game from the makers of Train Raider.&#10;&#10;Over five rounds, players try to collect five different types of goods by moving around the sea. The game uses two phases: first is the &quot;surf predicting&quot; phase where players play melds of cards in a Taj Mahal-type mechanic. The melds determine player order, selection of &quot;wave tile&quot;, and give other benefits. In the second phase, &quot;surf riding&quot;, players place their wave tiles on the board and then use cards to move through the sea on the waves to collect goods.&#10;&#10;The game is playable with English rules as the components are either language-independent or easily decipherable.&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Summary&#10;Setup: specific locations for subset of tiles, some face down; rest are to side, also face down. Deal out 7 cards (3 suits).&#10;&#10;Each round, players simultaneously select a card to play (max 5 cards total) -- choose the pass card to pass for rest of round. The resulting poker-style combinations give bonuses (VP, or special powers); the ranking gives you player order for the round.&#10;&#10;In order, select a face up sea tile (4 shapes, 2-3 hexes each, with one of 3 suits or wild). Then, in order, place the tile on the board and use some/all cards left in hand to move your mermaid around the board (playing card allows you to move mermaid to matching tile/space). Whenever on an island with token(s), look at face down tokens then add one of the tokens to your collection.&#10;&#10;At end of round, sea tiles with the darker color are removed from the board. Any mermaids on them are displaced to one of the unoccupied starting locations (player's choice). Then, deal 7 cards per player (max hand size 9) and repeat.&#10;&#10;Game ends after 5 rounds. Each player must discard 5 tokens (1 per symbol), or lose 5 VP per missing symbol. Then rank players' collections of sets of each type, awarding VP accordingly (rarer tiles, larger sets earn more VP). Most VP wins.&#10;&#10;",

The players must put their social deduction skills to the test by collectively identifying the Saboteur to regain control of the train.&#10;&#10;The train speed is controlled by a speedometer which is impacted by the cards that are laid by each players called Effect Cards. The gameplay is accented by dramatic interventions, votes on route taken and emergency meetings where players can be thrown off the train. If the players can exhaust the deck of Effect Cards, the train runs out of steam. Otherwise a collision is caused and the game is lost and the Saboteur has prevailed.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Each player places two toppings on the game board in the spaces designated with an X.&#10;&#10;In each round, the three players take turns placing one topping on the game board; that topping cannot be placed adjacent to any of that player's other toppings. Each player then secretly chooses a number (1-6) on his die; players reveal the numbers and lay their pizza cutters on the board in the space matching their number. The cutters divide the pizza into one of 216 possible outcomes, creating a number of slices. In each slice if a player has more toppings than each opponent, he replaces those opponent's toppings with his own; if two players tie for the most toppings, the toppings of the third player are removed but not replaced; in a three-way tie, nothing changes. (NB: If a player has at most one topping in each slice, then his toppings cannot be removed or replaced this round.)&#10;&#10;Whoever first places his 16 toppings on the game board wins.&#10;&#10;With only two players, the cutter and toppings of the third color are still used, with players taking turns placing those toppings on the board.

    "description": "September 1st, 1939: Germany invades Poland, setting off the Second World War. Except for minor attacks, France and Great Britain, the victors of World War One, do nothing. The Allies view the short Polish campaign of 1939 as a case of a newer, larger army winning out over an older, smaller army. Certainly the massed panzers are impressive, and need to be emulated, but the winter months see little positive activity on the Allied side. Missing the more vital lessons of the Polish campaign, the Allies are content to wait. Not only do their armies outnumber the Germans in terms of manpower, tanks and artillery, they have the advantage of operating on the defensive. Meanwhile the Germans feverishly apply the lessons they learned in Poland, and hone their operational techniques. The surprise German conquest of Norway jolts the Allies out of their lethargy. They do not have long to wait for the next blow.&#10;&#10;May 10th, 1940: Germany unleashes its Blitzkrieg upon the western Allies. Six weeks later, the war ends in a smashing German victory. Four Allied national armies have vanished. The tiny Dutch and Belgian armies, pulverized in battle, have surrendered. Great Britain rescues most of the soldiers in the BEF, but their heavy weapons and vehicles remain on the beaches of Dunkirk. The island nation begins to re-arm, but for now is out of the fight. The proud French Army, with many regiments tracing an unbroken lineage back to the 1600s, suffers the most catastrophic defeat of modern times before France surrenders.&#10;&#10;How did this happen? The Germans, realizing they could not win a repeat of World War One, set about reinventing the offense. Their formula included massed tank formations, an air force dedicated to close tactical support, and most importantly, a command and control system based on the use of radios. Allied tanks and soldiers were often equal or superior to their German counterparts &ndash; when given the opportunity to properly deploy and prepare. Unfortunately, such opportunities were few and far between. The Germans had securely positioned themselves inside an Allied decision making process that often took days to execute, rapidly concentrating, overwhelming defenders and then exploiting success. Certainly there were answers to every German innovation, but in six short weeks the Allies did not have the time to find them.&#10;&#10;Case Yellow is a simple, but accurate, simulation recreating this monumental campaign. Each game turn is divided into eight action segments. Each player has four action chits. The initiative player selects the first action chit to play. The remaining seven chits are placed in an opaque cup and drawn randomly. In most cases the Germans have the initiative and go first by playing one of their four action chits. Each German chit is marked for movement or combat, and the German player chooses what his army will do (though the German player during the course of a turn must use two chits for movement and two chits for combat). At the end of movement, any panzer or motorized formation adjacent to Allied units has the option to attack. If combat is chosen, all German units adjacent to Allied units may attack if allowed by terrain.&#10;&#10;Two Allied chits are marked two for movement and two for combat &ndash; not both.  The creaky Allied command structure will bedevil the Allied player throughout the game. Need to move? Sorry &ndash; you just drew a combat chit. Set up to attack? You drew a move chit, and only the number of motorized formations equaling the roll of a six-sided die can attack.&#10;&#10;Zones of control reflect that the infantry of both sides still fight by the rules of World War One. Infantry units must stop when entering an enemy zone of control. Mount a one hex infantry attack against a defender hex, and you attack only the units in the defender hex. Mount a two hex (or greater) infantry attack against a defender hex, and all adjacent enemy hexes must also be attacked (large-scale infantry attacks take time to set up, and the defender has the time to integrate adjacent units into the defense plan).&#10;&#10;Motorized units play by different rules, though the Germans with their better-trained, veteran formations do it much better than the Allies. Simply stated, any motorized unit with a Troop Quality (TQ) higher than any adjacent unit may disregard those adjacent units&rsquo; zones of control for purposes of movement, combat and retreat. Only a solid line is proof against motorized unit exploitation and envelopment, and only so long as combat does not create gaps. Additionally, motorized units only may attack a defender hex from two hexes without engaging any other adjacent defender units &ndash; the speed of motorized concentration allows the attack to go in before a traditional defensive response can be established.&#10;&#10;The Luftwaffe is present in overwhelming strength, allowing the German player to negate the toughest defensive positions if necessary. Each Luftwaffe asset marker provides a one column shift on the combat table. Each Allied air asset marker provides the same shift, but there are far fewer Allied markers &ndash; not that the Allies had far fewer planes (they had almost as many), but the Allied air-ground coordination was so cumbersome that planes usually did not arrive in time to influence the battles being fought.&#10;&#10;",

All players whose colors are on that card (one or two) are then allowed to build a new tower or build on top of an existing tower in this particular row. Building on an open space is free, while building on top of somebody else's tower costs as many ducats as the number of &quot;floors&quot; already built. A player can decide to trigger a general round of scoring simply by moving the last card of any stack. High towers are a good way to claim a large, connected territory and collect a lot of ducats.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "(See VGG entry: The Eye Of Judgment)&#10;&#10;The Eye of Judgment is a hybrid paper and electronic collectible card game which can be played using the PlayStation 3 game console, supported by the PlayStation Eye camera peripheral. It is one of the first games to use the peripheral, which is bundled with the game, along with a fixed Starter Deck and 1 booster pack. The trading cards are encrypted along their edges with a CyberCode matrix code. The game can also be played without the use of the Playstation 3 system, as a stand-alone card game. However this will cut out many unique graphics and require a person to keep track of numerous scores normally tracked by a computer - mana gain/loss, health bars, element advantages, field terrain changes, etc.&#10;&#10;Players take turns playing creatures or spell cards from a 30-card deck in order to control a majority (5 fields) of the 9 total fields on the playing mat which is laid out in a 3x3 grid.  Other than  controlling a majority of fields, players can also win if their opponent runs out of cards to play.  Creatures' overall effectiveness is determined by their Hit Points and Attack Score as well as any special abilities they may possess.  Five elements divide the game's units: Water, Fire, Earth, Wood, and Biolith.  The playing grid fields have a top and bottom side and each side is affiliated with one of the five elements.  Creatures placed on friendly elements receive HP bonuses while creatures placed on an opposite element (a Fire creature placed on a Water field) suffer a loss of Hit Points, so unit placement is important.&#10;&#10;In order to play any card (creature or spell), players must first pay a card's required summoning cost in mana (auto-generated for players every turn).  Each creature has a specific attack and defense pattern and these, along with the unit's placement on the 3x3 grid, determine where combat occurs and to some extent, how it resolves.  The extremely unique aspect of the Eye of Judgment game, however, is that when you play a card, the PlayStation Eye peripheral automatically generates that creature or spell into a 3D graphical version on your TV or monitor and it places it on a computerized version of the playing grid.  It also generates battle animations and resolutions digitally based on the cards involved or recently played.  This adds a level of visceral excitement to the collectible card game experience since you can actually see your minions battling it out in colorful digital fashion.  There isn't a single-player campaign but players can play matches vs. an AI opponent, another human, or online vs. other human opponents.  A rudimentary creature combat mode entitled Judgment allows players to determine which units would defeat other specific units in a head-to-head match-up.&#10;&#10;The Eye of Judgment provides 5 themed pre-constructed decks (Fire Crusader, Earth Emperor, Water Barrage, Wood Swarm, and Biolith Scourge) and the Starter deck that's provided with the base game (containing a variety of card types).  Set 2 is due for release sometime in mid-April 2008 and will add another 100+ cards to the game, with more advanced powers.&#10;&#10;",

You control an elite team of soldiers ready to enter the potentially lethal Deadzone and scavenge for whatever lucrative resources you can find. But competition is fierce, and other Strike Teams will be out to thwart you on your mission. Get in, get out, get rich, or get dead.&#10;&#10;CINEMATIC, IMMERSIVE GAMEPLAY&#10;&#10;Deadzone uses an innovative cube-based system for movement and shooting. Throw your tape measures in the garbage because you&rsquo;re never going to need them again! Apart from DIY, of course. Models can be moved anywhere in a cube, which ensures you can make the best use of cover and obstacles to avoid the enemy, and movement takes seconds, rather than minutes. Shooting is just the same &ndash; measure the distance in cubes and, if you can see it, you can shoot it! Wargaming has never been this fast or cinematic.&#10;&#10;MORE THAN 5 YEARS OF RULES DEVELOPMENT&#10;&#10;Since the release of Deadzone: Second Edition in 2016, we&rsquo;ve been refining the rules to make them faster and more streamlined. Third Edition incorporates all the changes and improvements made in the previous Outbreak and Escalation supplements, along with a host of other refinements. This is the Deadzone you love&hellip; just better. If you&rsquo;ve never played before&hellip; well you&rsquo;ve just found your new favourite game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
