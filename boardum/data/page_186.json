When this is managed without knocking down any blocks the player can remove a second block to keep as a scoring piece. Players also have to collect all blocks they let fall as negative points. Players can get rid of those by picking scoring blocks in the same colour.&#10;&#10;",

The other version is a best case scenario that pretends the Italians were not as inefficient as they were historically in that particular battle. making the game more balanced and better for two players. The one and two-thirds sheets of counters that have to be mounted (good cardstock provided with game) and cut-out are simple and attractive, same for the map. 7.5 miles/hex, 1 mo/turn, battalions-divisions.&#10;&#10;",

Who will get the best part?&#10;Capit&aacute;n Bacon is a fast family card game with strong player&rsquo;s interaction. The main mechanics are hand management, set collection and memory. To win you must get in your hand treasures of the same kind (being 3, 4 or 5), but your hand is limited to a maximum of 5 cards and the more treasure you get the less actions you can take, as treasure cannot be played. &#10;During your turn you can either play cards, trying to get the right treasure, or hide cards on the table, where you can retrieve them later. But no place is safe, as another player can steal cards from your hand or take cards from the table. Throughout the game more treasures come into play increasing the probability of completing a set.&#10;&#10;",

You're trying to collect as much gold as possible each round, and the player (team) with the most gold after the predetermined number of rounds wins.&#10;&#10;Each round, players start with seven cards in hand; cards feature numbers from 1 to 10, as well as negative numbers, cards that can be either positive or negative, and special plays such as the dragon and wizard. One player leads by playing a card to her &quot;horde&quot; (the table in front of her); if she plays a 1, she can play again immediately. The next player must follow &ndash; playing to his own horde first &ndash; and have an equal or higher total in his horde at the end of his turn. If he can't, he loses the trick; if he can, the opponent gets to play again and play continues back-and-forth until one player loses.&#10;&#10;Whoever wins collects 1 gold, plus 1 Gold for each Gold card in the pot. The winner draws one card and either keeps it or keeps the next card in the deck; the loser draws two cards (one of them being the card left by the other player, if any). Play continues until all 16 Gold have been claimed, at which point a winner is determined for the round.&#10;&#10;In a four-player game, you and your teammate share a horde and take turns playing into it.&#10;&#10;",

The game represents the tactics and possible results of many of the battles of this period. These battles are shown as scenarios giving a mix of units which are played out on sections of the homogeneous mapsheet to represent the actual terrain (as much as is known) of the original battlefield. There are seven different types of infantry units, two of cavalry and several other units available in the game; these units are provided in different quantities for each of the Player's (sic) of a scenario to recreate the historical armies. The game Armageddon has 14 scenarios, each of them representing two armies of the period, and assigning them positions on the map on which the players recreate the historic battles.&quot;&#10;&#10;Game components: 255 die-cut counters, heavy paper hex map with terrain features and the scenarios printed to one side of the mapboard, and a rulebook. One six-sided die is also needed.&#10;&#10;Mechanics: Alternating movement turns consisting of fire phase, movement phase, and combat phase for one player, then second player does the same. No zones of control. Units have facing, and can only move into the three hexes to their &quot;front&quot; or change facing at a movement point cost. Stacking is limited to three units per hex, but applies only at end of movement. Units have &quot;front&quot; and &quot;flank&quot; melee combat strengths, and use the latter when attacked from any of the three rear hexes. Combat results are no effect, disruption, retreat, 1/2 elimination, or elimination, and only affect the defender.&#10;&#10;",

To do this you will compete with the other players for control of four tokens that will let you gain, lose, or otherwise manipulate the dice.

Besides the board, this time you have 7 cardboard character pawns, life chips (each character's &quot;hit points&quot;), cards, special dice and dinosaurs (our old friend T. Rex, three velociraptors, six pteranodons and two spinosaurus).&#10;&#10;The 30 cards are sorted into five piles: Jaw to Jaw, Raptor Rumble, Pteranodon Terror, Spino's Revenge and Race To The Rescue.  The dinosaurs (taxonomically, pteranodons aren't dinosaurs; they belong to a different order, the pterosaurs) start in designated places around the board, as do the humans except for little Eric (who appears as a result of a card draw).&#10;&#10;The object, for the humans, is to make it across the island to the exit (rescue spot); the dinosaurs try to prevent this, of course.  There will always be one dinosaur player, the other players sharing the humans.  Movement is die-based for both dinosaurs and humans.  One human moves at a time, but there is a die face that moves a group of up to 3 at once.  The dinosaurs are restricted to separate zones of the board and only act whilst humans are on their territory.  Like with the humans, only one dinosaur moves per turn, except that a die face allows *all* dinosaurs to move 1 space.  There are some board spaces usable only by humans and vice-versa.&#10;&#10;Combat is dice driven as well.  Pteranodons have a nasty tendency to snatch characters and bring them to their nests, where the character must escape or eventually be eaten.  Humans have the option of burning hit points to get extra turns -- a risky gamble.&#10;&#10;The humans win by reaching the far beach and drawing the WIN card from the Race To The Rescue deck.&#10;&#10;From the same film series:&#10;&#10;    Jurassic Park Game&#10;    The Lost World Jurassic Park Game&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Prevented from retreat by orders of Adolf Hitler, the German forces soon found themselves pocketed, their only supply source an airfield at the town called Korsun. The Soviets relentlessly tighten their stranglehold against the German troops in the pocket. At the same time, the Germans mount increasingly strong relief efforts against the outer Soviet perimeter. Can the German relief forces break the Soviet lines before the Soviet forces completely destroy the pocketed troops?&#10;&#10;Cherkassy Pocket was designed by John Desch, and features a system similar to his wargames Wave of Terror and Berlin 45. Units are battalions and brigades, and the ground scale is 1.25 miles per hex. Each game turn represents 24 hours, and each player gets to move and perform combat twice in a turn. When it's time to activate friendly units, a player may choose to move first and then fight or vice versa. There are special rules to reflect the failure of Soviet tank maintenance, the use of the Korsun airfield as a supply source, Soviet difficulties in coordinating multi-formation attacks, and the ability for tank units to infiltrate enemy lines. Four scenarios allow you to play different portions of the battle, or to play the whole 23 turn campaign.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 1 day&#10;Hex: 1.25 miles / 2 kilometers&#10;Units: Battalion to Brigades&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 22 x 34&quot; full color map&#10;Three dual-side printed countersheets (540 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 16-page Cherkassy Pocket rulebook&#10;Three single-side printed Player Aid Cards&#10;One 6-sided dice&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: High&#10;Complexity Level: Medium&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 4-15 hours&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Ironman Football is a team management game based on gridiron football in the early 1920's. That was a time when there were no TV million$, no real passing game as they played with a squashed medicine ball, shoulder padding was a sturdy arrant jumper, helmets were strictly optional and you were expected to play on both offense and defense.&#10;&#10;The game features such notable institutions as the Pottsville Maroons, the Dayton Triangles and the Frankford Yellowjackets, and mega stars like Red Grange, George Halas, Jim Thorpe and Paul Robeson.&#10;        &#10;The game works on the old system of pulling a team together, playing a series of games, whacking down some event cards and trying to obtain the best record to win the league.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game you are handed some event cards, a league franchise, a team name and, unless you are very unlucky, a handful of star players. You also get some money.   Your core players, the poor faceless grunts in the trenches, are abstracted into a simple team rating and a total salary bill (excellent idea) but the star players, the backs and ends, are each given their own individual card. As team manager, it is your job to balance the huge benefits of having these talented individuals on your staff with the interestingly high salaries they demand for performance.&#10;&#10;The three key areas of offense, defense and special teams can all be enhanced by the star cards.&#10;&#10;In addition to the player-controlled teams, who will usually play each other twice, the game also supplies a range of 'autopilot' opponents. There are league teams who are often as good, or even better, than the players' lineups and also sandlot teams.&#10;&#10;Event cards add a lot to almost any the game. They can be played either before your weekly scheduled game or during the game itself. Their effects are wide ranging; from new gadget plays that can give you an extra dice on offense, to sponsorship deals that enable you to sell out to local government for big money. There are college players, fan loyalty, rain insurance, scams, scandals, intrigue and even subtle stuff like players' agents, loyalty and defections.&#10;&#10;Once you have played the game, you work out the gate receipts, which are divided between the home team and the visitors based on a pre-agreed percentage split. There are variables such as number of star players on show, rain, home opener, whether you are playing a winning team, etc. As it is more profitable to be at home (no travel expenses) and to play the winning teams with the most star players, each team has an inherent draw factor - remember this is pre-TV - and can negotiate and earn high income accordingly. Want to play the top rated Canton Bulldogs (8-0-2, three star players) at home? You are going to have to offer their boss a healthy enticement to come to Oolong and perform against your 0-5 Indians, just to earn some money to pay off your overdraft.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, having pocketed your share of the take, you must pay all the players their salaries and if you can't meet the payroll, you will start to lose staff. They may stay on out of the goodness of their hearts, but you also need to apply to the league for a stay of financial execution and avoid bankruptcy. All this links into the league structure. If you have any sort of claim against your opponent you may appeal and have your rival reprimanded or fined, and always at the back of your mind is simply surviving game to game. You must maintain a winning record, you need to find new players to satisfy the butcher's bill of game injuries and, if you survive all that and play nine games well, you'll get a shot at the league title. Interestingly, the game can be won by other means than just having the best record. The team with the most money also gets a point, and a winning season will accrue another. It is unlikely that with a title win you'll lose, but there will be teams close on your tail.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "INTRODUCTION&#10;&#10;Vault is an abstract game in which each player tries to reach the opponent&rsquo;s back rank. Vault is named after pole vaulting, which is a track and field event in which a person uses a long, flexible pole as an aid to jump over a bar. Vault is a derivative of Onager, by the same designer and uses a variation of its jumping mechanism (also present in Billabong, for example) that allows multiple directions to be used. It&rsquo;s like vector movement but without acceleration. Unlike Onager, Vault only works well on a square grid, as jumping directions are difficult to visualize in a hexagonal grid.&#10;&#10;MATERIAL&#10;&#10;- A square grid with an even number of cells (recommended 10x10). Preferably checkered* for clarity, but this is not mandatory.&#10;- As many white and black pawns as the number of cells per side.&#10;&#10;SETUP&#10;&#10;Each player has an allocated colour (Black or White). Fill your nearest row with pawns of your colour (one per cell).&#10; HOW TO PLAY&#10;&#10;White starts. Players alternate turns during the game until the victory condition is reached. On your turn, either walk or jump with one of your pawns.&#10;&#10;Walk&#10;&#10;Move one of your pieces to an adjacent empty space as a King in Chess.&#10;&#10;Jump&#10;&#10;In order to jump, choose 2 friendly pieces. One of the pieces then jumps over the other piece in the direction defined by both pawns, landing on a space beyond that is at a distance equal to the distance between the two friendly pieces before the jump was made (like a mirror). Notice that jumping is not restricted to orthogonal or diagonal directions.&#10;&#10;The landing space must be either empty or occupied by an enemy piece, which is then captured and removed from the game. A piece cannot land on a friendly piece. Pieces cannot land outside the board.&#10;&#10;Notice that the spaces between the jumping pawn and the landing space don&rsquo;t need to be empty. Also, captures can only be made by jumping.&#10;&#10;GAME END&#10;&#10;If at the start of your turn you have at least one piece on your opponent's back rank then you have won.&#10;&#10;If the above condition is not reached and you can&rsquo;t make a legal movement at the start of your turn, you lose. This rarely happens. Players may agree on a draw at any moment during the game.&#10;&#10;NOTES FROM THE DESIGNER&#10;&#10;This is intended to be the simplest game that uses this jumping mechanism. I&rsquo;ve decided not to use Onager&rsquo;s stacking mechanism (in order to make is simpler for turn based online play and also playable with non-stacking pieces) or the multiple jump (as it would be almost impossible to think ahead).&#10;&#10;As a variant, you can use the stacking mechanism of Onager.&#10;&#10;(*) On a checkered board, the jumping piece always lands in a space of the same colour as the starting one.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "There might not have been a &ldquo;sun of Austerlitz.&rdquo; It was a bit after four that afternoon. The Russians had moved a column behind Gazan into Durenstein. His men, though victorious up to this point, were exhausted and nearly out of ammunition, with no relief in sight. Brigadier Jean Graindorge begged Marshal Mortier to escape the encirclement by boat to avoid capture or death. Mortier's answer was clear: &quot;No! We must not separate from these brave fellows; we must be saved or perish together!&quot; For most people, even veteran Napoleonic Grognards, the &ldquo;War of the Third Coalition&rdquo; has three distinct parts:&#10;&#10;    Turning away from the aborted invasion of England, Napoleon takes his army on an astonishing force march, surprises Mack and much of the Austrian army at Ulm, and forces their surrender. &#10;    French capture Vienna, using sneaky tactics. &#10;    Big, decisive battle at Austerlitz. &#10;&#10;&#10;Game over.&#10;&#10;Austerlitz may have been Napoleon&rsquo;s classic battle, in his own estimation. It was certainly one &lsquo;title&rsquo; he refused to award to anyone else, though several of his marshals coveted being named &ldquo;Duke of Austerlitz&rdquo; or something. No, it was his masterpiece. But it was not the only battle of the war. And another one might have changed everything. While most of the French army is heading for strudel in Vienna, a newly slapped together corps - the VIII - is chasing the Austrians out of Bavaria, looking to snap up stragglers, loot, and also block anticipated Russian reinforcements from making it to the decisive battle for Vienna that Napoleon expected to fight. Newly created corps often have ragged organization, and such was the case here. While Marshal Edouard Mortier had an entire division of cavalry under his command, he allowed most of it to separate on its own mission and then allowed the tiny remnant to go adventuring also. In tactical terms, he was &ldquo;blind&rdquo; when he reached the town of Durenstein, perhaps most famous as having the castle where King Richard I had been held for ransom.&#10;&#10;Commanding a Russian army much closer than Mortier realized was the wily Marshal Kutuzov, who was neither blind nor overconfident. He saw the overextended enemy advance as a chance to strike a blow and suckered the lead division into a valley between two heavy Russian columns. Not only had Mortier lost touch with his cavalry, but he allowed his three infantry divisions to become widely separated as well. He was marching with his lead Division, under T.M. Gazan, into a situation that might have been known as the &ldquo;Valley of Death&rdquo; fifty years before a spot in the Crimea earned that title. Kutuzov did not have everything his own way, however, as the columns he wished to attack with were exhausted, starving, and freezing&hellip;hardly in condition to be launching an assault. But they did, in a battle that lasted for hours and on into the night. &quot;We must not separate from these brave fellows; we must be saved or perish together!&quot; Gazan (and Mortier) would certainly have &ldquo;perished together&rdquo; had not the nearest support, Dupont&rsquo;s division, covered a day&rsquo;s march in half the time. The battle sputtered on into a freezing cold night before the Russians finally withdrew, even more miserable than they had been at the start.&#10;&#10;Both sides claimed victory, but, with 60% casualties, Gazan wasn&rsquo;t very thrilled at the outcome, though he may have felt better about it when awarded the highest Legion of Honor. Mortier&rsquo;s reward was simply to be reassigned&hellip; although he would later have a distinguished career, both under Napoleon and the rulers who followed him, dying under bizarre circumstances that merit a story all their own.&#10;&#10;Now this hardly-known battle - fought three weeks after Ulm and three weeks before Austerlitz - can be yours to explore. Step into Mortier&rsquo;s shoes, in a truly &ldquo;Against the Odds&rdquo; situation. When the battle starts, you are outnumbered 4-1 in infantry, 20-1 in guns, and &ldquo;lots&rsquo; to &ldquo;almost none&rdquo; in cavalry. But Kutuzov has challenges too. His men are exhausted and hard to get into motion. These Brave Fellows' game mechanics cover the difficulties of coordinating attacks (and fighting in the snow), and variable arrival times of the Russian columns and supporting French. Optional rules allow players to explore the &ldquo;what might have been&rdquo; situations that were so close to happening - both sides had additional troops who could have been involved (or could have gotten there a lot sooner than they did). Can you, as Marshal Kutuzov, thoroughly smash the arrogant French and increase the shaky confidence of the Third Coalition? Can you, as Marshal Mortier, do better than &ldquo;hold on&rdquo; with the last few survivors and lower the battered Russian army &lsquo;s morale even further?&#10;&#10;&#10;    Map - One full-color 22&quot; x 34&quot; mapsheet&#10;    Counters - 216 full-color 9/16&quot; die-cut pieces&#10;    Rules length - 10 pages&#10;    Charts and tables - 2 pages&#10;    Complexity - Low&#10;    Solitaire suitability - Average&#10;    Playing time - Up to 3 hours&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "The Third Crusade Opens&#10;&#10;It was the destruction of the Crusader army by Saladin at Hattin in 1187 that had led to the collapse of the Crusader kingdoms in the Levant, including the loss of Jerusalem. Guy of Lusignan, the erstwhile ruler of the city, appealed to the Europeans for aid, which soon arrived. But without waiting for the three main Crusader armies &mdash; led by King Philip of France, Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, and Richard I of England &shy;&mdash; Guy set out to capture Acre on the Levantine coast. His first assault was repulsed and Guy settled in for a siege. Meanwhile, Saladin gathered a portion of his army and rode in to lift the siege. After preliminary skirmishing, the opposing armies met east of the city on 4 October.&#10;&#10;Acre uses the new Battles of the Medieval World system, a variation on the venerable Battles of the Ancient World system. The battle is dominated by masses of heavy cavalry and disciplined lines of heavily-armed and armored men-at-arms. Swirling around these forces are masses of foot- and horse-archers, whose purpose is to disrupt the heavy formations and make them easy prey for their counterparts. Using the classic Combat Results Table, the fighting is close and bloody until the morale of one side weakens. Once a line breaks, the victor must pursue ruthlessly to prevent a rally. Leaders enhance combat power and restore broken formations.&#10;&#10;At Acre, the Crusaders have more combat power, but must maintain a long line to protect their siege works. The Arabs are quick but light, and must find a way to isolate portions of the Crusader army and defeat it in detail. Victory will go to the player who deploys his army to best utilize his strengths and take advantage of enemy weaknesses.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

In addition to money cards, there are special cards, such as the Investigator, Journalist, Larcenist, and Accountant.

Everyone gets a character with a HeroClix combat dial to track their level and build points. One player is the villainous mastermind and is able to guide the direction of each encounter; the rest are the heroes who each control a single hero for the mission and must work together by combining their vast array of powers and abilities to complete various objectives, such as infiltrating an enemy warehouse or saving hostages.&#10;&#10;Each hero is unique with individual play styles, giving players multiple options to play the way that best suits them. The environment also lends to the game play, putting obstacles in the way of players and granting them objects they can use as weapons. A wooden crate may block Captain America's path, but he can pick it up and hurl it at enemy Hydra soldiers. Players will quickly pick the role that best suits their team and lead the heroes to victory &mdash; or at least they hope so!&#10;&#10;Aside from standalone missions, Marvel Strike Teams includes a campaign-based game in which the players can improve their heroes over the course of several missions. With randomly generated scenarios, multiple map tiles, and thousands of possible encounters, each mission will feel like a fresh experience!&#10;&#10;Playable characters: Captain America, Iron Man, Quake, Agent May, Winter Soldier, Baron Strucker, Radioactive man, &quot;3 Hydra Soldiers&quot;&#10;&#10;",

ZnajZnak allows even 32 persons to play with the use of one set of cards. While playing the ZnajZnak game, players learn to recognise symbolic characters, dates, figures, places and objects of the Polish history.&#10;&#10;The game is composed of 132 cards. Each of them presents 12 different symbols concerning the contemporary history of Poland. If you take a closer look at any two cards, you'll find out that they contain a common character. 132 cards, 133 symbols and always only one common character. The aim of a player is to notice the character on two other cards on the table and to tell its name as fast as possible. If the player succeeds to do that, he/she passes his/her card to another player. If he/she does not know the name of the character, he/she turns the card, reads the definition of the symbol, puts a new card on the table, and the game goes on. The winner is the person who first gets rid of all the cards in hand.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "From the Decision Games' website:&#10;&#10;The port-town of Tobruk was the key to Libya. The Axis had been besieging it since April 1941, threatening to push the Allies back into Egypt. The Afrikakorps, commanded by Irwin Rommel, had already defeated the Allies' previous attempt to relieve Tobruk, Operation Battleaxe, but a new, surprise Allied offensive in November 1941, Operation Crusader, would evolve into one of the most chaotic and near-run battles of the entire North African campaign.&#10;&#10;Crusader utilizes the new Fire &amp; Movement combat system that's designed so players can augment their units with &quot;support fire&quot; during the course of the battle. From mortars to tanks, units can receive support assets to engage enemy positions and formations, allowing combat to develop at all levels. A single recon battalion, for example &mdash; perhaps supported by air cover &mdash; could be tasked to assault a lone enemy infantry regiment defending a key hilltop. As that attack gets underway, the recon battalion may find itself under the guns of enemy artillery. So more support fire will be necessary to take the hill, but assets are limited.&#10;&#10;In Crusader, the attritional design of the new Combat Results Table simulates the true nature of battles in North Africa. Units are typically two-sided formations that can incur casualties, accurately replicating the realities of combat and the high losses sustained by both sides during the actual fighting around Tobruk. Winning the battle is thus a matter of maneuver, firepower and asset management.&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Crusader: Battle for Tobruk, November 1941&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The game involves relatively trivial memory and tactical components, as players discover the hidden destinations of each of three movers and try to maneuver them through the building to deliver a load of furniture. The more entertaining part of the game begins when a load is in the correct location to be delivered. The acting player then choses a partner, and together the two players attempt to maneuver miniature doll house furniture into locations specified on a floor plan card using a pair of wooden sticks. (Each player is allowed to hold only one stick...) If the furniture is upended or dropped, it is considered broken and neither player earns a tip. The game ends when all the furniture has been delivered; the player with the most tips wins. Primarily a dexterity game with cool bits and an interesting cooperative element, although the advanced rules add some tactical possibilities.&#10;&#10;",

Devise the perfect strategy while you collect, battle or barter for the parts you need to create your own ultimate monster. Not much of a fighter yet? Just keep searching for monster parts on the playing field but always watch your back! Other players will stop at nothing to build their own army of perfect monsters, even if it means attacking everything you&rsquo;ve built so far. Will you be able to build your monsters on time to defend what&rsquo;s yours and conquer your opponent? Or will your bad strategy cost you an arm and a leg?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Courtney Joyner in his novel, Nemo Rising. The game allows 1-4 players to assume the roles of the protagonists of the series &mdash; Captain Nemo, Sara Duncan, Adam Fulmer, or Ulysses S. Grant &mdash; as they explore new worlds, overcome dangerous obstacles, and complete challenging missions.&#10;&#10;As you and your fellow players work together, you can choose to explore one of two scenarios. The first scenario is the Undersea Grotto, in which you must venture outside the Nautilus to gather supplies while avoiding sea hydras, deep sea scavengers, and the mechanical Kraken. The second scenario is the majestic City in the Sky, in which you must thwart Robur the Conqueror and his army of foot soldiers, war dogs, and steam-powered creations. Special action cards and customized dice allow you to attempt dangerous tasks and overcome powerful enemies in order to save the world.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Each card played needs to be higher than the previous one, and all cards left in your hand when the round ends count as penalty points.

    "description": "First there was UNO. Well, first there was Crazy Eights, but never mind.&#10;&#10;Then came Zar which added even more viciousness. The &quot;draw two&quot; card in Zar is a colored Wasp. The trick is, if you play a Wasp in response to being zapped by a wasp, then the opponent to your left must draw 2 cards equal to the numbers of wasp cards in the stack, unless your opponent plays a wasp which would make the next player draw even more cards unless HE also played a wasp, etc.&#10;&#10;It's not uncommon for players to quickly draw huge handfuls of cards. There is a nice  balancing mechanism however. If you can match an identical card that someone just played you can &quot;match&quot; the player by quickly discarding the card. The player who played the original card must draw one card and play passes to the next player from the person who laid the Match. So the more cards you have in your hand, the more matches you can make to get rid of them.&#10;&#10;Zar has a faster pace than UNO and constantly keeps you on toes to match your opponent's cards. This increases player interaction, excitement, and much more chaos.&#10;&#10;If even Zar becomes too tame for you check out The Totally Insane Card Game.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "From the publisher:&#10;&#10;With the fall of Jerusalem, Europe learned a new synonym for bogeyman - &quot;Turk.&quot; Organizing the Moslem forces of the Middle East with discipline and training, the Turks recaptured the Holy Land and gradually took over the rest of Asia Minor and spread into Europe like a slow tide, including capturing Constantinople and swallowing the remnants of the Byzantine Empire and the Balkans. Presuming extreme cruelty, various European leaders called for new crusades, to free fellow Christians from &quot;the Lash of the Turk.&quot;&#10;&#10;The game covers the tenuous period in history when all of Christian Europe felt threatened by Suleiman the Magnificent, Turkey's greatest sultan. Would Hungary be the next prize for the Ottoman Turks? Would Vienna follow, and the dam of resistance collapse entirely? You decide.&#10;&#10;One side features various forces from Europe, who sometimes seem more divided than united by their &quot;common religion.&quot; The other side includes the might of the Ottomans with new &quot;allies,&quot; vassal states who prefer their new overlords to being part of the Holy Roman Empire.&#10;&#10;Designed by Andy Nunez, The Lash of the Turk features 176 large counters and a 22 by 34 inch map covering the area from Graz to Bucharest. Units represent various columns of infantry, artillery, and cavalry. Game rules stress ease of play, but give players lots of options, including river movement and combat, siege rules, forage, and political turncoats. Four different scenarios let you juggle the strengths and weaknesses of the principal leaders for both sides, along with Austrian, Hungarian, Transylvanian, Tartar, Turk, Bavarian, Polish, and Franconian troops and appearances from other nationalities. Can you can hold off the Turks? Can you conquer new lands for Allah? Find out, in ATO #30.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "&quot;Dawn of Empire: The Spanish American Naval War in the Atlantic, 1898&quot; is an uncomplicated wargame centered on the naval aspects of the Spanish-American War of 1898 in the Atlantic Ocean. The game depicts this conflict at a strategic level, with most operational and tactical details represented by fast and easy-to-play systems, rather than intricate mechanisms. The intent of the game is to provide a broad overview of the historical events while being fun to play.&#10;&#10;It all really started in February of 1895 when Spain unilaterally suspended constitutional guarantees to Cuba and its population. This lead to open revolt on the island and serious retaliatory measures by the Spanish administration of Captain General Weyler, including concentration camps for non-combatants. This was too much for the American press, and as a result, the American public, and eventually U.S. pressure led to Weyler&rsquo;s removal, but not to a decrease in tensions between the US and Spain. And then, the Maine happened. On 15 February, 1898, well into the darkness of the night, the USS Maine, anchored in Havana Harbour to visible enforcement of U.S. interests on the island, blew up. 268 U,S. naval personnel were killed, about 2/3rd of the crew of the vessel. The American press exploded also. Headlines shouted &ldquo;Spanish Treachery&rdquo; and William Randolph Hearts newspapers stirred the pot of American anger vigorously. By late March a Naval Court Of Inquiry set down a judgment that the Maine was destroyed by an external explosion, pointing the finger by implication at the Spanish. Before the end of the following month, the United States would declare war on Spain.&#10;&#10;The object of the game for the United States player is to control the sea areas around the US Atlantic coast and Caribbean Sea to prevent Spanish combatants from supporting their island holdings and to destroy the naval forces of Spain. The object of the game for the Spanish player is to disrupt United States sea control, retain sea control around the Spanish coastline for as long as possible, and destroy United States naval forces. Both players must deploy their naval resources into the sea areas on the map to earn victory points at the end of each turn for areas under their control, blockaded, and for opposing units destroyed.&#10;&#10;Product information&#10;Complexity: 4 out of 10&#10;Solitaire Suitability: 4 out of 10&#10;Time Scale: 11 days per turn&#10;Map Scale: variable (area movement maps)&#10;Unit Scale: individual warships&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Moonflight is a deck builder with an unusual, deck un-building twist. Players must build a deck in order to have the resources to buy scoring cards but when the game ends only cards in hand will score, so any resource generating but non-scoring cards become garbage in the later half of the game. The winner will be the player who un-builds as well as they build.&#10;&#10;The game is set in a mythic fay town, Moonflight, which comes about with the waxing of the hunter's moon and fades with its setting. Players take the part of one of the mysterious Jacks, the rulers of Moonflight, and must be the most powerful of their kind when they walk away at night's end.&#10;&#10;Game play is based around the &quot;turn&quot;. When the market place is exhausted all cards spin to a second version, activating card trashing rather than resource gaining abilities. The game ends when one player attempts to draw a card and cannot, at which point players score exactly which cards are in their hands.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
