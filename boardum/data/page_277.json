In each round each player is secretly assigned to be one of six game companies.  Players then place cards on each of six companies nominated for that award.

For security reasons, the Emperor himself has hand-picked the crew of the Nostria, one of the armored zeppelins of the imperial fleet.

(In Japanese, they overlap by syllable; in English and other languages, by letter.)&#10;&#10;The artwork name that the turn player chooses can be a sentence, a quote, an onomatopeia, or anything.

Otherwise, the card placed in this turn is discarded and the failed player must draw one card from the stack.&#10;Then the turn moves on to the next player.&#10;&#10;Once a player has no cards remaining, that will be the last round. If multiple players are able to place all of their cards during the last round, all of them are winners.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Long before the game came to Europe, the Japanese were racking their brains with it. Usually Sudoku is a solitaire game, but now with SuDoku: Das Brettspiel, you can play it with up to four players.&#10;&#10;A SuDoku consists of 9 fields with 9 squares each. In each field and in each row, both vertically and horizontally, only the numbers from 1 to 9 may appear once. Different numbers are given before the game. Now it is up to the players to find out where which of the numbers from 1 to 9 are to be entered. It is important to achieve your goal by excluding.&#10;&#10;Since the playing field is empty at the beginning, 9 numbers are initially distributed over the 9 fields. There can only be one number in each row, each column and each square. On your turn, you place a number card in an empty space, paying attention to the laying rules. Then, receive as many points as there are numbers in the square and on the vertical and horizontal line. With each number played it becomes more difficult to accommodate your own, but you also get more points the further the game has progressed. At the end of your turn you draw a new tile. The game ends when no player can add another number without breaking the rules. The player with the most points wins. Children can play on the back of the game board on 6x6 fields. You don't use numbers for this, but animal tiles. The point rule applies as with the big ones.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "This is a new game inspired by the bestselling novel of the same name and licensed by the film company that is making the movie based on the Da Vinci code book. The game includes 15 different mysteries for players to solve and uses some clever tools that players must employ to solve the mysteries. An instructional DVD that explains the game and shows an example mystery being solved is also included.&#10;&#10;There are 2 phases to the game. In the first phase players roll and move their pieces around the board to visit various sites to look at clue cards so they can figure out the mystery phrase first. Each of these clues require a different mechanism to solve. Some use a mirror to reverse the letters, some use a decoder box that is laid over the card in a certain way to reveal part of the mystery phrase, some cards you line up against a special decoder tool, and some are just riddles or puzzles to solve. Some clues will also require the player to go to the center of the board and visit the library to retrieve a card there with information that will help them solve their clue. Alternately, players might need to visit the Louvre and examine a painting there. When the players visit the Louvre the players only have 30 seconds to find the correct card with the painting that relates to their clue, examine the painting and the information on the card about the painting and hopefully discover the information they need to solve their current clue.&#10;&#10;Players can also discover one of two special types of cards: Taxis which let the player move around board quicker and a computer card that lets you look at another player's notes for 30 seconds.&#10;&#10;Once one player thinks they have solved the Mystery Phrase they go to the center of the board and announce the answer. If they are right then all players score 1 point for each letter (and blank space) they had correct in the Mystery Phrase. The player that got the Mystery Phrase correct gets 5 bonus points.&#10;&#10;This begins Phase 2 of the game as 5 questions are now read from the mystery book. These questions relate to the clues that the players discovered during the game. Each question a player gets right is worth 5 points. If a player gets all 5 questions correct they score another 5 points.&#10;&#10;Players lose points for any Taxi or Computer cards they had left in their hand at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": " &gt;&gt;&gt; ICE COLD ICE HOCKEY IS NOW LIVE ON BOARDGAMEARENA.COM!!!&#10;&#10;Ice Cold Ice Hockey is a thinking-man's card game that has been designed to simulate all the excitement of professional ice hockey. An action deck of 64 cards, three rink-cards and comprehensive yet easy-to-understand rules comprise the complete game (although you'll need to supply a small token, disc or coin). The cards serve multiple purposes, including passing, skating, shooting, defense, shot-blocking and goaltending. Experienced players will be able to complete a game in about an hour.&#10;&#10;Note that this is NOT just a &ldquo;draw and play cards (or a take-that!) game.&rdquo; Card combinations and good decisions are key in ICIH. You&rsquo;ll always want to keep an Inside Shot card in your hand, for example, in the hope of pairing it up with a Pass or Skate card that leads to an Inside Shot. (Your brain will be working on all cylinders during the entire game, and your play will improve over time as you learn to watch for the appearance of important cards.)&#10;&#10;I call the above a &ldquo;set-up.&rdquo; Three and even four-card set-ups are possible, and over time you&rsquo;ll learn what they are. You can also bluff a bit; for example, if you have a surplus of Offensive Zone (OZ) Skate or Pass cards but no Inside Shot card, you can play an OZ card which allows the play of a defensive card to tease one out of your opponent&rsquo;s hand.&#10;&#10;ICIH features realistic shots on goal, scoring and game play. Sometimes you&rsquo;ll effortlessly set up end-to-end plays while at other times you&rsquo;ll only be able to dump the puck out of your own defensive zone. You&rsquo;ll shoot from the point and, after some effort, from close-in. On defense, sometimes you&rsquo;ll be able to challenge the puck-carrier and sometimes you won&rsquo;t. Sometimes you&rsquo;ll have to risk a penalty to stop an opponent&rsquo;s scoring chance. Loose pucks, blocked shots, breakaways, fighting, momentum, penalties, super-saves &ndash; they&rsquo;re all here in Ice Cold Ice Hockey!&#10;&#10;",

A successful hotel consists of three components: the land on which it's built, the hotel buildings, and the entrances by which guests arrive in the hotels. All three components need to be bought separately with in-game money. As in Monopoly, money is earned by players who end up on one of the entrances of your hotels, after their dice roll. The more luxurious the hotel, the more money a guest will earn you. Money you can use to build extensions to your existing hotels, buying new entrances or pay other players when you arrive at their hotels.&#10;&#10;The game consists out of cardboard, three-dimensional hotel buildings, recreational grounds and entrance stairs that can be placed on the large game board.&#10;&#10;",

The players each have a rotating plastic gun attached to their end of the board, behind a wire goal frame. The idea is to fire ball bearings from the gun to knock your puck into your opponents goal, and keep theirs  away from yours. The board is slightly curved to cause the balls to roll into pots at each end for re-use.&#10;&#10;A new version has been released by MB. The new version has more than one puck, and a smaller, rounded board. The original version came out in the 1970's and had a rectangular board and simple round pucks.&#10;&#10;This game is similar to Gunfight at OK Corral.&#10;&#10;",

The King can move one space in any direction, forward or backwards along its diagonal grid. Advancing your piece to the opposite end of the board creates a Queen that can fly diagonally across the board, seizing all opponents in her path. Both Queen and King have a strategic value, so choose wisely because once a Queen or King that  piece remains so until defeated or game is over. Each game starts with either 9  pieces that can only move forward along its diagonal grid, so be mindful of the Queen and her pursuit of her opponents &#10;In Queens &amp; Kings ...A Checkers Game, In Team mode it takes a coordinated effort to defeat your opponents.

To play a card, the card must depict the symbol missing from the top card of the discard pile in the missing color or it must also be missing the same symbol in the same color. In the latter case, the player laying down the card says &quot;Voodoo!&quot; and all other players must draw a card from the bottom of the discard pile and place it on the bottom of their personal ingredient pile. Then all players start playing again.&#10;&#10;At any time, a player can place a card from his hand on the bottom of his ingredient pile, then draw the top card of this pile. Whenever a player plays a card, he draws a replacement card to keep three cards in hand.&#10;&#10;When a player runs out of cards, the round ends and everyone scores one point for each card still in hand or in the pile.

The game board is composed of 3 by 3 game tiles, so the game board on which is played is a huge square of 63 cm x 63 cm. This is large enough for several players to be able to play the game at the same time. The game board is &ldquo;alive&rdquo;, it is not a static board as the tiles are flipped over, turned and moved. So it is not possible to memory map the board. The mechanic of an ever changing board makes it not only fun; also the challenge is kept into the game all the time.&#10;&#10;A game turn &#10;Players will have to throw a color dice at the beginning of their turn. According to the color thrown (3 possibilities) they must draw a mission card of the same color. There are 3 kinds of missions.&#10;&#10;How to win the game? &#10;Be the first one to have successfully accomplished 10 missions. Each successful mission gives 1 point, so be the first one to get 10 points. &#10;The artwork is something not to be found in &lsquo;standard&rsquo; games. The personal drawing style of the artist Eugene makes this a kind of playing artwork.&#10;&#10;",

At the start of play, the tiles are scattered on the table, creating twelve stacks that are each one tile high. On a turn, you take one stack and place it on another stack that is either (a) the same height or (b) topped by a tile with the same symbol. Stacks cannot be divided. Players take turns until one player cannot make a move; that player loses the game and the other player wins.&#10;&#10;Soluna is nearly identical to the earlier Bruno Faidutti game Babylon, but the double-sided discs create a new starting set-up for each round. The first player to win four rounds wins the game.&#10;&#10;Reimplements&#10;&#10;&#10;    Babylon&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Keep an eye out for special chips that really ramp up the heat with spicy effects.&#10;&#10;On your turn you'll reach into the bag and pull out a chip.

Then take any chips in front of other players that have the same number!

Get it before it's cool.  It even has a pretentiously  hipster name, since it only includes one die.&#10;&#10;The rules are characteristically evasive but the gist is: there is a six-sided die. Each side of the die represents a category: music, drink, literature, fashion, movies, and food. One player rolls the die and has one minute to declare a factoid concerning the rolled subject. If everyone accepts the factoid as true, then play passes to the left. If someone challenges the factoid, then that player has two minutes to disprove the statement using whatever electronic device is handy. The winner in the challenge scores one point. The winner of the game is declared when that person scores five points. Players will have to provide their own score keeping units and electronic device for research.&#10;&#10;",

Napoleon's Grande Arm&eacute;e launched an attack against the Russian army, driving it back from its initial positions but failing to gain a decisive victory. Both armies were exhausted after the battle and the Russians withdrew from the field the following day. Borodino represented the last Russian effort at stopping the French advance on Moscow, which fell a week later. However, the French had no clear way of forcing Czar Alexander to capitulate because the Russian army was not decisively defeated, resulting in the ultimate defeat of the French invasion following the retreat from Moscow in October.&#10;&#10;Two scenarios are provided: a historical scenario (where units are placed as they were actually deployed) and a hypothetical scenario (where players are free to deploy where they wish).&#10;&#10;Victory is solely based on Russian strength losses, the French player must eliminate at least 90 strength points to win. (approximately 40% of the Russian army).&#10;&#10;Originally published by 3W (World Wide Wargames) in Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #136; errata appears in S&amp;T #138.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Turn: 30 minutes&#10;Hex: 328 yards / 300 meters&#10;Units: Division&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 22 x 34&quot; full color mapsheet&#10;One dual-side printed countersheet (200 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 12-page Borodino: Doomed Victory rules booklet&#10;&#10;Complexity: Medium&#10;Solitaire Suitability: Medium&#10;Players: 1 or more&#10;Playing Time: 3-6 Hours&#10;&#10;Players will need to provide one 6-sided die&#10;&#10;",

If they end up on a spot showing a hole, they fall into the room shown below. On their next turn, they roll the die to see if (and where) they come out, as each room has several exits. The last room on the board has one exit that leads to a mousetrap, which makes the player lose two turns. The first player to reach the last spot on the board &ndash; the big cheese &ndash; wins!&#10;&#10;",

After dealing out the cards, you go through a series of information reveals, then you start trying to sway Phillip to believe what you want the King to believe...&#10;&#10;After a certain amount of discussion and at the discretion of His Majesty King Phillip IV, one monk looks at another player's card.  This is followed by more discussion, then another monk looks and reports back.&#10;&#10;Once all of the monks have spied on another player and reported back, more discussion takes place, then at the discretion of His Majesty, two players are identified. If Phillip finds the Temple Grandmaster and the Archivist, then Phillip and those loyal to France (blue team) win the round; if not, then those loyal to the Templars (red team) win the round.&#10;&#10;As soon as one (or more) players have won three times, the game ends with those players being victorious.&#10;&#10;",
