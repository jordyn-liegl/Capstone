Carlos Hatchcock&#10;&#10;You and your spotter enter play on one of four terrain maps: jungle, desert, countryside, or ruined city. Though you are at distance from your mission target, you will need to score morale points to be able to move into new zones, getting closer to your target. As you do, enemy hostiles may be seen, forcing you to avoid detection or they may need to be engaged to complete your mission. Movement into new zones closer to the target, is achieved by KIA enemy hostiles which gives you morale points that are expended in order to move but beware of the trip wires and claymore mines. Doing this all the while trying not to draw too much attention to yourself. The enemy may call in reserves looking for you. Many items may help you such as scopes and med kits and other useful equipment.&#10;&#10;A hand of cards gives the player options to fire, move, crawl, and hide. Location cards are used in each zone and the player will gain cover from these cards but also may find a surprise event. The player will need to earn morale points to be able to move into the next zone, these are earned by killing enemy hostiles. A player only has a certain number of wounds that can be taken during a mission and critical wounds will see the player in real trouble. Taking a shot is a tense moment the wind and other factors could affect the shot, if missed enemy hostiles will move closer towards the sniper and may even attempt to conduct an assault against them.&#10;&#10;Not only may single missions be played. A campaign is also possible consisting of ten missions. As each mission is completed, you will accumulate kill points which may be used to upgrade your weapons or obtain additional equipment.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "In the new card game of the Starnberger Spiele publishing house and the author Tanja Philippeit, the aim of the players is to collect the lowest possible scores in a display of nine initially hidden cards. You could almost mean &quot;No Prob-Lama&quot;. But far from it! In addition to a bit of luck in drawing cards, &quot;No Prob-Lama&quot; is especially about clever tactics. Otherwise you end up with an unintentionally high score. And as if that was not enough, then a drama lama or a karma lama can get in the way.&#10;&#10;Each player receives nine cards, which he disguises in a rectangle arranged in front of him. These are revealed during the course of the game and exchanged with cards from the stack. The goal is to have the lowest possible card values &#226;&#128;&#139;&#226;&#128;&#139;in your display at the end of a round. You can even achieve minus points by collecting three identical cards in a row or a column. A round ends as soon as a player has revealed all nine cards. Who then has the lowest score, wins the round and may grab a piece of wood in the form of a lama. The first to collect three Lama pieces, ie to win three rounds, is the winner.&#10;&#10;Of course, it's not that easy. The collection of triplets is very attractive, but at the same time quite risky. Because the trick here is: the higher the numbers of the cards are in a treble, the more minuses you get. However, if a teammate finished the round, before you could complete the treble, you sit on solid plus points. And you definitely do not want them in this game. So you better play it safe and only collect low cards or rather speculate on the highest possible triplet? Some players even come up with the idea to end the round intentionally fast, when his teammates are currently working on a treble with high cards to mess up their tour. For proper vortex care in between all the special cards. With the drama lama one buzzes additional points on a fellow player. With the Karma Lama on the other hand, you have to give away minus points. There the joy is great - for the others!&#10;&#10;So while you optimize your own display, you must constantly keep an eye on the players. Most importantly, you should avoid discarding a card that the next player can use for his triplets collection.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "The aim of the game is to build the best motorcycle in 8-10 playing rounds. The higher the HP, the more points the player gets for it. At the beginning each player gets 8-10 cards, depending on the number of players. Turn after turn he can get new cards, but must also put cards into the discard pile. If one player has enough parts to put a motorcycle together, he knocks on the table, if it is his turn. Now all players can draw one more card before phase 2 of the game begins. Successively the players lay out a motorcycle, normally the smallest possible combination. A motorcycle consists of a front wheel, an engine and a rear wheel with the gear change. Then the knocking player begins and plays one of his cards. This can be done in four ways. If possible, one can attach another card to the motorcycle; one may also exchange a card of the owned motorcycle and put the exchanged card on the discard pile. And a player might also put a covered card on the discard pile, if he has no more use for it. Apart from that players can play cards against other players to bug other players, if the target player does not have a defense card.&#10;When all cards have been played, players count the points they get for their motorcycles (HP multiplied with the amount of gear shifts(rear tire) and front tire). The HP is entered in a block, and a new round begins. After 10 rounds the player with the highest total score wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "This is a game where you choose a character with some different stats, and then play cards and draw new cards from the stack until the stack runs out of cards. The one with the most &quot;votes&quot; in the end gets elected to high scool president and thus wins the game.&#10;&#10;It's a humour-based, hilarious but rather complicated card game where a lot of the enjoyment relies on you knowing the clich&eacute;es in japanese animation concerning high school comedy. Though there's a lot of japanese text on the cards, it's playable without knowledge of japanese if you have a translation sitting nearby. Moreover, you learn what the cards do rather quickly.&#10;&#10;Game description&#10;There are two card piles: the play card pile and the &quot;standard vote&quot;-pile. The &quot;standard vote&quot;-pile contains only cards with a number of votes, 1 to 6 on each card. The play card pile consists of special vote cards (can be worth a lot, and also may have special powers), action cards (that affect other players) or event cards (all players have to sumbit to certain conditions).&#10;&#10;At your turn, you draw a play card and (unless it's an event card wich affets all players) may either take 2 actions OR draw yet another game card. Actions include drawing a standard vote card, playing a game card from your hand, or using a special power (from your special vote card or your character).&#10;&#10;The &quot;standard vote&quot; cards are kept hidden, people can see how many you have but not how much they're worth. The special vote cards however, (which are worth much, representing votes from whole clubs like the baseball team, the newpaper club and so on), are placed before you. These can be &quot;attacked&quot; by action cards, either nullified or stolen. Some action cards can cancel other action cards, and some special votes cards can be immune to attacks like these if you discard cards from your hand etc.&#10;&#10;So the game goes on until you've taken 2 laps through the draw pile of game cards. When the fourth event card is drawn, game ends immediately, and the person with most votes win.&#10;&#10;As said, much of the flavour of this game consists of clich&eacute;es in high school anime. The names of the standard vote-cards are sometimes hilarious. Some one-vote cards are named &quot;the ghost girl who nobody has ever seen&quot;, &quot;the maid robot&quot;, &quot;the one who secretly goes to a certain market selling certain home made comics&quot;, other cards include &quot;the I don't know whatever&quot; (3 votes), &quot;the ones with a boyfriend&quot; (2 votes), &quot;the diet girls&quot; (4 votes) et cetera. The special vote cards are typical high school clubs in japanese high schools.&#10;&#10;A very nice game but probably only for those who enjoy the style.&#10;&#10;",

But can you always believe their stories?&#10;&#10;Every player gets five cards, showing one of five animals with quantities of 1, 2 or 3. The starting player plays a card face down on the table, making a claim such as &quot;I have seen one Yak&quot;, then draws a new card. Next player adds to that stack, raising the claim, either by raising the number or the size of the animal. The cards in the stack represent the animals which have actually been around. Play continues in clockwise order until a player calls a bluff and flips open the stack. If it doesn't contain at least as many animals of the last kind as were announced, the bluffing player takes the stack as a penalty, if it does, the caller takes them.&#10;Beware, there are some special cards that players can sneak into the stack, those which reduce the numbers on the cards or those that make all animals appear as the same kind.&#10;When the draw pile is exhausted, the player with least penalty cards wins.&#10;&#10;The game is a simplified reimplementation of Bluff im Zoo.&#10;&#10;",

Once each player gets a turn, then the villains of the game or, the &quot;Cotter + Wife&quot; get a turn as well! These cards will attack cats from either opponent.&#10;&#10;If your opponent attacks you with a deadly spell card and you can't deflect it with a magic card, then your cat is killed. However, that means your opponent has summoned the wrath of the &quot;Ancient Elder Gods&quot; and must pull a card from their deck, then follow what the card says. This is never good.&#10;&#10;Once your spellcaster is completely surrounded on three sides with the proper cat cards, thrown down a &quot;Kill&quot; card on the &quot;Cotter + Wife&quot; card to win the game!

Alternatively, you can set your monster on those of the other players, and if you have the last monster standing, you win.&#10;&#10;To assist you in your goal &ndash; and to preserve your reputation in town &ndash; you'll hire assistants, then send them out to collect body parts, buy supplies and earn money.

Each assistant has at least one vice, however, and when moving about town they might be lured away by the prospect of beer, jewelry, dresses or sausage, selling or dropping everything they have to get their fix.

    "description": "One hundred and fifty years have passed since the first match in the Galactic Arena. This ancient mystical arena was originally located in an abandoned Serpente subsystem forgotten by time. After the First Apocalypse, the Terrans built endless numbers of space platforms to colonize space, and an agreement was brought forth between the Terrans and a mystical sect of great influence to lease the space platform CETUS-7. The ancient arena was rebuilt on top of the platform, taking the galactic fights into space.&#10;&#10;The Atomic Brotherhood holds all the broadcast rights for the Arena, netting them trillions of Credits for every minute of every fight. Their aptitude for organizing unconventional games makes them exceedingly popular with the masses, and now the time has come again. Gladiators from all over the galaxy are gathering on CETUS-7. Only five heroes will survive to face the coming Apocalypse. The Oracles have spoken the words: &quot;May the Zenites shine upon you.&quot; Those who cannot understand their meaning are destined to meet their doom.&#10;&#10;Apocalypse Universe: Galactic Arena, the first of five projects set in the Apocalypse Universe, is a strategic science fiction &quot;hero vs. hero&quot; game that takes place in the Galactic Arena of CETUS-7. The guiding principle of this game is replayability. Each hero has different stats and abilities, allowing unique builds that depend on player choice.&#10;&#10;The game is played by 2-6 players and can be played as 1vs1, 2vs2 or 3vs3. In 1vs1, the players follow a draft procedure and pick 1-3 heroes out of the ten available. After both players have chosen their heroes, they prepare them to enter the Arena. Heroes can equip weapons and special abilities before combat. The arena board consists of a grid of hexagons with starting positions, secret traps, and treasure crates.&#10;&#10;Both players secretly choose, then reveal heroes, placing them on the two starting positions of the board. The hero with the highest initiative score plays first. The player controlling him is considered the attacker and his opponent is the defender. Each hero has a number of action points that can be used to perform his special abilities, to defend, or to attack. A ten-sided die is used for attacking and defending. The attacking player adds his hero's attack score to his attack roll and the defending player respectively adds his hero's defense score to his defense roll. When a hero is wounded, he loses health points &mdash; and at zero health, he's defeated.&#10;&#10;",

With good planning and some luck on the dice, you'll collect more turtles than anyone else and triumph on this whirlwind island tour.&#10;&#10;During set-up, players arrange the island tiles, then place five or six turtles on various tiles, depending on the number of players. Each player places his character token on the island and takes five color dice.&#10;&#10;In each round, all players simultaneously roll their dice, then arrange them in the order they want to use them. Whoever first completes his planning grabs the sand timer in the center of the board, starting the timer for everyone else to finish their plans. Once time runs out, this player moves his character on the island, moving it to an adjacent space matching the color of the first die in his plan, then moving it again, and so on &ndash; ideally picking up lots of turtles along the way. The other players take turns in clockwise order. A player who lands his character on a corner space can move to either adjacent corner space (as long as he's placed the correct color in his movement chart).&#10;&#10;Players add turtles to the board to bring the total available to five or six, then start a new round. Once all the turtles have been collected, the game ends and the player score for the turtles they've collected: 8 points for a set of six differently-colored turtles, and 1 point for each other turtle. Whoever has the highest score wins!&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Exploration was a very popular 1970s game from Britain's best game company, Waddingtons. The dramatic &amp; colourful box cover, showing the Kon Tiki raft, mountain climbers, ziggurats, and scuba divers on a wreck, inspired thousands of British kids to explore the globe, at least in their fantasies. To win, you must mount an exploration to one of four Objectives (Lost City, Summit, Island and Sunken Galleon), return to base and make the most money. Being first back was not enough, you've got to make the best profit on your trip.&#10;The game is played in 2 phases; initially you move round the outer track on die rolls, collecting Personnel cards, buying Equipment cards and drawing Exploration Club cards (which may gain or cost you cash to the Prize Fund). When your group is assembled, take the appropriate dobber (Yacht, Lorry, Tent or Ship) and set off.&#10;The 2nd phase has you moving over land or sea using the unique Diradice, a d6 with a 5 symbols. These allow you to move 1 or 2 spaces orthogonally or diagonally. The problem is that the spaces on the board are littered with symbols which you can only cross if you have the correct equipment, like the compass, dinghy or mountain boots. You must have an explorer with the Main Objective to reach your goal, but the other personnel allow you to avoid hazards and reach Lesser Objectives (Skeleton, Pearls, Rare Flower etc.) to gain cash. 1st, 2nd and 3rd home get cash and 1st back gets the Prize Fund.&#10;A pretty simple game of dice rolling, the only real choice is when to launch your trip. But the theme, the striking board and cards and that weird die makes this a fondly remembered game in the UK.&#10;&#10;",
