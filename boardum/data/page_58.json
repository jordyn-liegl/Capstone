    "description": "1000 Blank White Cards is a public domain card game, which allows the players to make the cards during the course of the game. There are no initial rules, and while there may be conventions among certain groups of players, it is in the spirit of the game to spite and denounce these conventions, as well as to adhere to them religiously.&#10;&#10;Card Content&#10;&#10;Cards may feature a title, a picture, a score, a rule, or any other content, and need not be limited to one side or even to a single card. Early iterations of the game included cards with attached objects, and cards of a variety of sizes and shapes within the same deck and gameplay session. Many cards in later decks have a point value, but this is by no means a requirement.&#10;&#10;Cards generally include hand-drawn pictures. The game encourages quick sketches by non-artists, which can add to the overall ironic orientation of the game. Card illustrations can represent anything the designer wants to feature, from serious to absurd. (However, usually cards tend toward the latter.)&#10;&#10;Game Play&#10;&#10;Game play conventionally follows a &quot;draw one, play one&quot; rule, with standard rotation; however, this, as with any game parameters, can be arbitrarily altered in play.&#10;&#10;In one variant, blank cards are simply made available to all players at all times, and can be created without limitation and played in turn. In other variants, players seed an otherwise blank deck with their own invented cards, which are shuffled in with blank cards to form a deck of about 60-90 cards. In this latter variant, a player may only craft a new card if he or she draws one of the blank cards during the course of play.&#10;&#10;In most cases, unless countermanded or constrained by rules created during gameplay, players may play a card on themselves, on another player, or on all players. Card rules and actions may counter other cards which have already been played.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the deck is exhausted. Points may be tabulated and a winner declared. In some variants, players may then lay out all of the cards face-up for the &quot;epilogue&quot;, which allows players to choose the best cards to seed the deck for the next game. In other variants, all cards must be retained and reintroduced, regardless of perceived quality.&#10;&#10;Similar to:&#10;&#10;    Dvorak&#10;    Nomic&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Players manage an adventuring guild, competing with each other to become the most famous guild as an escalating series of events threaten the land. In each of the nine rounds, players simultaneously and secretly program orders to send teams of adventurers out to do the following:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Recruit more adventurers.&#10;    Attempt increasingly difficult contracts to gain money, fame and other rewards.&#10;    Hire builders to upgrade their guild to increase their capacity to do all of that more.&#10;&#10;&#10;All players then sequentially resolve their planned orders, starting with each players' 1st order, then 2nd order and so on, and in the order they appear on the board (builders, then adventurers A-F then contracts 1-6).&#10;&#10;Players plan and program orders carefully around other players' likely moves, various strategies, risks, and rewards. They manage their guilds' growth and optimize combinations between their adventurer abilities and contract rewards to achieve their goals. As the game advances, guilds become more powerful and must rise to meet an increasing number of game state changing threats. Recruiting increasingly powerful adventurers and upgrading your guild capacity are both key to victory. There are various ways to exert control over the board, your dice rolls, and your chances to get what you want.&#10;&#10;Most orders are resolved by paying coin or rolling dice based on your adventurers' skills. Sometimes players resolve these orders alone, and sometimes cooperating with, or in conflict with, other guild's adventuring teams attempting the same thing at the same time. When players' orders overlap, coins and negotiated prisoners' dilemma cooperate/conflict skill checks resolve the contest. Negotiation over shared goals, contract bonuses and reward splits is encouraged and rewarding, but not absolutely required to win.&#10;&#10;Everything you do earns you fame (victory points) and other rewards. At the end of nine rounds, any remaining coins are converted to fame at a rate of 5 coins = 1 fame. Then any special prestige upgrade fame is added. The most famous guild is then declared the winner.&#10;&#10;",

Your mission is to deploy your forces with maximum effect to destroy British and Allied shipping, while limiting your own submarine losses.&#10;&#10;Featured scenarios cover actions ranging from famous short single sub patrols, through short campaigns, ending with the full campaign covering 1939 to 1943. The game map breaks the Atlantic, Mediterranean, South Atlantic, and Western Indian Oceans into historical Operations Areas through which subs patrol in search of shipping.&#10;&#10;Special rules feature historical events such as the invasion of Norway and Torch; b-dienst, ULTRA, and the intelligence war; torpedo improvements, German wolfpack tactics, Super-Skippers, large vs. small U-boat philosophy, appeals to Berlin for resources, and many others. Every German sub deployed between 1939 and 1943 (as well as some what-if classes) is represented with its very own counter, each meticulously and accurately drawn and shown from their side in full-color. Players familiar with Silent War will find Steel Wolves takes the system to new depths, while those trying it for the first time will be able to quickly get into action!&#10;&#10;",

Each player starts with four amazons (which move as chess queens, but do not capture) placed in predetermined locations on their side of the board.  On a player turn, he moves one amazon and then fires an arrow from the arrival position. Firing an arrow consists in placing a new arrow piece on the board; also the arrow moves like a queen from the position it is fired. The landed arrow doesn't move anymore and creates a permanent block on the board. Arrows can not be passed through by either amazons or other arrows.  The first player who can not make a legal move (move and then shoot) loses the game.&#10;&#10;",

As Russia&rsquo;s communist government was burning secret papers and evacuating Lenin&rsquo;s corpse eastward out of their ancient capital, Moscow was hanging in the balance.

    "description": "(from GMT website:)&#10;&#10;Blood &amp; Roses focuses on the battles of the Wars of the Roses in England, between 1455 and 1487. This was warfare in which most men were truly &quot;of iron&quot;, heavily and totally armored to such a point that their mobility was suspect. It was also the introduction of gunpowder &ndash; mostly field artillery &ndash; in noticeable numbers. And while many English men-at-arms were mounted, they did so almost entirely for transport. Most fighting was on foot &hellip; and it was quite vicious.&#10;&#10;Historical Note: The game&rsquo;s title refers to the heavy casualty rates and the names given to many of the fields after the battles: Bloody Meadow, Bloody Field, et al. &#10;&#10;Blood &amp; Roses is designed for quick learning and easy play. Game rules are short, there are no &quot;turns&quot; - play is Continual, with ample opportunities to steal play from your opponent - and combat resolution is a single dieroll. Playing time is about 1-2 hours, per battle.&#10;&#10;Battles:&#10;&#10;    1st St. Albans (22 May 1455) marks the first major engagement in the Wars of the Roses. Richard, Duke of York and his ally, Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick, defeated the Lancastrians under Edmund, Duke of Somerset, who was killed during the battle. York also captured Henry VI and forced Henry to appoint him Constable of England.&#10;    Blore Heath (23 September, 1459) where greatly outnumbered Yorkist infantry used the longbow and a defensive position to drive off the Lancastrian Men-at-Arms.&#10;    2nd St. Albans (17 February, 1461) where the Lancastrians drove the Yorkists out of the town and then destroyed Warwick&rsquo;s strangely deployed army, even when sturdily defended by hedges, caltrops and spiked netting.&#10;    Towton (29 March, 1461) is easily biggest battle in the box and the biggest in the entire series. It uses over 200 combat units and, much like the actual battle, will probably take a long time to play. It is mostly crash and bash, with little room for maneuver, all fought in a blinding snowstorm!!&#10;    Barnet (14 April, 1471) a classic battle of planned deployments, but overlapping wings, cries of treason in the lines, fog of war (actual fog), and the excellent use of reserves. &#10;    Tewksbury (4 May, 1471) a battle that shows one of the key terrain features of the battles in this era, extensive hedges and thick underbrush in otherwise clear fields.&#10;    Bosworth(22 August, 1485) the best-known battle of the wars and the tragic (I think) death of King Richard III in a battle he should have won. Using the latest information as to where the battle took place, let&rsquo;s see if you can cancel out the Tudor dynasty.&#10;&#10;&#10;Each game includes:&#10;&#10;    Two double-sided 22&quot; x 32&quot;game-maps&#10;    2.5 sheets of counters&#10;    Rules Booklet&#10;    Battle Book&#10;    Charts and Play Aids&#10;    2 ten-sided dice&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Designer:  RICHARD H.

    "description": "(from GMT website:)&#10;&#10;During the summer of 1941, the forces of German Army Group North appeared to be advancing irresistibly toward Leningrad, the second largest city in the Soviet Union, and the birthplace of the Communist revolution. But Leningrad was a long way from the German border, and the closer the Germans got to it, the more difficulties they encountered with terrain, their own lengthening supply lines, and stiffening Soviet resistance.&#10;&#10;In mid-July, approximately 100 miles south of Leningrad at Soltsy, a surprisingly strong Soviet force of about six divisions struck the German armored spearhead and pushed it back. The 8th Panzer Division did not suffer the catastrophic losses claimed by the Soviet, but attack did cause the Germans in this sector to halt for three crucial weeks before resuming their drive on Leningrad.&#10;&#10;In August the Soviets launched another counteroffensive, this time with ten divisions, against the German flank south of Staraya Russia. Just as the German offensive against Leningrad renewed, the Germans diverted critical motorized reserves to deal with the threat, winning a strategically barren victory far from their true objective. When the Germans did reach Leningrad, they lacked the strength to break into the city itself.&#10;&#10;The battles of Soltsy and Staraya Russia may well have saved Leningrad.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&middot; 22 x 34 inch map sheet (19mm hexes - double sided)&#10;&middot; 3 sheets of 5/8&quot; counters&#10;&middot; Rules book, Play Book, set-up cards, and player aid cards&#10;&#10;TIME SCALE  12 hours per turn  &#10;MAP SCALE  1.2 miles per hex   &#10;UNIT SCALE  Battalions and Companies&#10;&#10;DESIGNERS Vance von Borries&#10;DEVELOPER Tony Curtis&#10;MAP &amp; COUNTER ART Mark Simonitch&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;(BGG description:)Roads to Leningrad is a package consisting of two separate operational level games on WW II --the Battle of Soltsy and the Battle of Staraya Russa.&#10;&#10;Scenarios: &#10;1. The Battle of Soltsy: Manstein&rsquo;s LVI (Panzer) Corps was assigned the road through Soltsy and was told to advance rapidly east to Novgorod and then north to cut Leningrad off from the rest of Russia. Manstein was on such a quick and tight schedule, he had no time to cover his flanks - a fact local Soviet commanders quickly exploited.&#10;&#10;2. Counter-Blow at Soltsy: Led by the powerful and highly decorated 70th Rifle Division, the Soviets quickly surrounded German armor at Soltsy, stopped German motorized infantry in the swamps to the north, and raided German supply columns to the German rear. Von Manstein, unflappable in a crisis, organized a counterattack to allow the 8th Panzer to escape. The German 8th Panzer Division permanently lost about 30 tanks (with many others damaged) and retreated 25 miles. It was a Soviet victory that might have saved Leningrad.&#10;&#10;3. Battle of Staraya Russa: In early August, the Soviet High Command prepared a surprise counter-offensive south of Lake Ilmen to relieve pressure on the increasingly hard-pressed armies defending Leningrad. Within two days, Soviet mechanized units had penetrated 35 miles and threatened to surround German X Corps. The Germans will clearly need reinforcements; can they hold on until Manstein's motorized troops arrive?&#10;&#10;4. Manstein Attacks: To solve the deepening crisis at Staraya Russa, the German command called on Manstein's LVI Corps. On the 19th he struck, crushing the Soviet flank division in one day. In three days, he surrounded Soviet 34th Army, forced most of it to surrender, and then pushed on east. German play in this scenario depends on the mobility and timing of Manstein's troops. The Soviet player knows he is about to be trapped but maybe one more push would break the German infantry to the north.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Each Anno Domini set consists of 340 cards, with a description of a historical event on one side of the card, and the year (and sometimes specific date) in which it happened on the other.&#10;&#10;Each player receives nine of these cards (or less, if you want the game to be shorter), and may only look at the descriptions. Players then put in turn a card on the table, *trying* to put theirs in chronological order. A player may, instead of adding a card, claim that the order in which the cards were put is incorrect. In this case all cards are turned over and the correct years revealed.&#10;If the order was correct then the doubting player receives two cards and skips a turn. If the order was incorrect then the previous player, who accepted the order as correct, receives three cards. The first player that gets rid of all the cards wins.&#10;&#10;Bluffing is as least as important as knowledge in this game. Most events are rather obscure or are hard to date exactly, so this ain&rsquo;t no game for the nerds/geeks of this world, even they might think so, because it&rsquo;s full of surprises and pure fun. Highly Recommended, because Anno Domini is a blast to play, is a very enjoyable social event and you even learn something from it.&#10;&#10;Unfortunately there is no English edition in existence, but this game could be a good way, to improve your already existing German skills or a very good reason, to learn German language in the first place.&#10;&#10;The Set &quot;Anno Domini - Flops&quot; contains historical events related to things that went wrong completely. It can be played as a standalone or together with the other sets, which is the best way of playing it.&#10;&#10;Part of the Anno Domini series&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "TSCHAK!' is a card game in which everybody gets to play with exactly the same hands. But who will be the most successful in avoiding the troglodytes and bigger monsters, while going for the fattest treasures, or even better, the legendary rings of power?&#10;&#10;The card deck in TSCHAK! is composed of twelve wizards (blue), twelve warriors (green), twelve dwarfs (red) and four artifacts (purple). Before the first round, a player receives three wizards, warriors and dwarfs and one artifact. (When playing with fewer than four players, deal out hands to virtual players; these are not used during the current round.) Set up the keep by placing one monster and one treasure tile face up on each of the three levels.&#10;&#10;Players now assault the keep, trying to avoid the monsters and claim treasure. On the first level, players choose one card from their hand, reveal it, choose another, reveal it, choose a third, and reveal it. A player must create a team of adventurers with three different colors, and the strengths of these teams (the sum of the cards' values) are then compared. (The chameleon wizard with a ? equals the strongest wizard on the table. The artifact doubles the weakest character on your team.) The weakest team gets the monster card, which costs points, and the strongest team gets the treasure card, usually positive points. Ties are broken in favor of the strongest wizard, then in favor of the wizard with the wand, then the strongest warrior, and so on.&#10;&#10;On the second level, players reveal one card, then a pair of cards, then compare strengths. On the third level, players reveal three cards at the same time. Players then compare the last card in hand, gaining 0-3 gold depending on the strength of that final card.&#10;&#10;Once all ten cards have been played, each player passes his whole hand to his left neighbour, a new dungeon is created, and you now play with the same cards as the player sitting to your right. After four rounds, the game ends and players tally their points. Some treasures and monsters are worth a set number of positive or negative points; others are worth the square of the number of them you've collected (whether positive or negative); additional treasures have special abilities, like eliminating one monster card from the tiles you've collected. The player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;Good hand management, double-guessing, a tad of luck, and the victory is yours!&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Martin Wallace's 2-player wargame for Treefrog's second line of games (2009-2010 series, 4th game of the series) dealing with the American Civil War - the players commanding either Confederate or Union forces. With Gettysburg Wallace wanted to produce a balanced rather than a historically accurate game. The game e.g. ignores casualty levels, and Units do not correspond exactly to brigades or divisions - even if the forces' proportion is close to historical accuracy.&#10;&#10;The player pieces in Gettysburg are similar to those in Treefrog's previous wargame, Waterloo. Each day consists of four periods, and the game is played over three days, and key locations must be held by the end of one period.  Each player has eight numbered 'order blocks', ranking from two to five.  Players then place such blocks in the game areas, the order block allowing a number of orders to be issued that area.  The orders can activate units in the same or adjacent areas.  Orders are represented by discs, once the number of order discs in an area matches the value of the order block then no more orders can be issued.  The players will then have to remove the block and place a new one. If a player does not have enough order discs for the following period, he will be forced to pass for each disc he is short.  Assault combat is similar to Waterloo, the main exceptions are that the attacker and defender use different morale check tables. The defender is more likely to retreat than be eliminated, but there is also the chance of a counter-attack to throw back the assaulting forces. The Confederate player wins by taking two starred areas, or Little Round Top.&#10;&#10;Only 1500 were produced all signed and numbered.&#10;&#10;",

Players take on the roles of Thorgal, his wife Aaricia, their son Jolan, and Kriss &mdash;a deadly female warrior&mdash;, and go on a series of adventures. The game consists of 7 stand-alone scenarios, each taking roughly 90-120 minutes of play. Scenarios do not form a campaign nor have any legacy features, so they can be played by different playgroups and over an extended period of time.&#10;&#10;Thorgal: The Board Game comes with a book of maps. Each scenario is played on a different map that players explore while fulfilling scenario goals and promises completely different adventures, hidden opportunities, side quests, and vivid characters. Players are free to choose whether they travel in one group or split to cover more areas at the same time. Each character gains experience during the game and advances their abilities. Characters gather resources and craft objects to help them survive in the dangerous world.&#10;&#10;There is a storybook containing narrative descriptions of the encounters that Characters make in each scenario. The adventures described in the book are specific to each scenario and Character, with randomized elements offering higher replayability and allowing for repeated play. There are also Side Plots players can pursue to gain benefits and reveal additional pieces of the story.&#10;&#10;Thorgal: The Board Game also has a unique action selection mechanism. In this new mechanism, actions have varying power depending on which other actions have already been taken. Players must carefully plan their strategy and sequence of actions taken, as this directly impacts the strength of the effect of each action.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;The Gamefound edition has more content.&#10;&#10;",

The usurper Pelias gave Aeson his word that when Jason will come of age, he will give crown and throne to the young prince, but that was a promise he did not intend to keep. When Jason, a young man now, confronted Pelias and asked him to honor his word, the usurper tasked Jason with a seemingly impossible quest to prove that he is worthy of the throne of Iolkos. He had to recover the Golden Fleece from the distant city of Kolchis. Jason accepted and sent word to famous heroes to aid him in his quest. Hercules, Orpheus, the brothers Kastor and Polydefkis, Laertes the father of Ulysses, were some of the 50 heroes who answered Jason&rsquo;s call and joined him in his noble quest on board the legendary ship &ldquo;Argo&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;Argonauts is a cooperative game that requires careful strategic planning and just a bit of luck, as even the best laid plans, can fall victim to the wrath of the Gods. The game&rsquo;s objectives are to acquire the Golden Fleece and return safely to Iolkos without losing Argo or too many members of her crew. Each player controls heroes that participated in the Argonaut campaign, each with his / her own set of skills and special abilities. Following the journey from the myth, the Argonauts must face mythical monsters like Scylla and Harybdis, Harpies, Sirens, the construct Talos and the dragon guarding the Fleece, not to mention the perilous journey full of lethal encounters with merciless pirates or having to weather destructive thunderstorms all the while making sure their cargo hold is well stocked with the necessary supplies for the journey to and from Kolchis and their ship sea-worthy.&#10;&#10;Each turn, the players must decide which of their characters will participate in the encounter they face, dealing with threats with either might or cunning and keeping in mind that these characters will be unavailable to face the next encounter due to exhaustion. But the Argonauts are not alone in their quest. The Gods occasionally take interest in their actions, either helping or hindering the progress of our heroes, laying careful plans to waste&hellip;&#10;&#10;",

No great drawing talent is required; instead, players gain an edge if they have a good imagination when guessing, empathy for their team mates, and/or a general ability to communicate in restricted circumstances.  A board is provided, just to keep score on, which focuses the competition.  Pictionary was a big hit when it first appeared and has been a classic on the party game scene ever since.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "&quot;Soldiers in Postmen's Uniforms&quot; is a skirmish-level solitaire wargame that takes place in the Free City of Danzig on the first day of the Second World War.&#10;&#10;Danzig (present-day Gda&#197;&#132;sk) came into being in 1920, in accordance with the 1919 Treaty of Versailles. Over the next two decades the city became a flash-point in Polish-German relations, which culminated in the Danzig Crisis of 1939. On the first day of the Second World War, German forces moved in to seize Polish installations in Danzig. Two of the installations were on alert and under orders to hold out: the Military Transit Depot on the peninsula of Westerplatte and the Polish Postal Office No. 1. The personnel of the post office repulsed repeated assaults, and were forced to surrender only after a day-long siege, when the post office was doused with gasoline and set alight. Though German propaganda cast these acts of defiance as futile and a failure, they were viewed by the Polish people as symbolic of their stand against a materially superior aggressor.&#10;&#10;In Soldiers in Postmen&rsquo;s Uniforms you take control of the valiant defenders of Polish Postal Office No. 1 in the Free City of Danzig on the first day of WW2. Under your command, the defenders must fend off relentless attacks from the Danzig Schutzpolizei and two German SS units.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Object of the GameThe goal of Soldiers in Postmen&rsquo;s Uniforms is to recreate the incredible historic accomplishment of the Polish postal workers by defending the post office during the day-long siege. You must last until the three enemy card decks are depleted, while protecting the postal workers and non-combatants. You score points for defenders that survive the assault &mdash; the higher your score, the better.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;GameplaySoldiers in Postmen&rsquo;s Uniforms is divided into three attack periods, each of which is represented by a deck of enemy cards.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Attack 1 took place during the morning hours. This was the Danzig Schutzpolizei&rsquo;s initial assault, which targeted  the rear of the post office.&#10;     Attack 2 took place during midday. In this assault, the Schutzpolizei attacked the front of the post office and were supported by armored vehicles as well as infantry guns and a howitzer from SS units.&#10;     Attack 3 took place in the evening. This final assault was conducted by elements of two SS units against the front of the post office. It ended when the attackers brought up a fire engine filled with gasoline, pumped it into the building, and ignited it with a hand grenade.&#10;&#10;&#10;Each attack period is divided into turns, and each turn consists of three or four phases (depending on the attack period):&#10;&#10;&#10;     Enemy Phase: Resolve five enemy cards.&#10;     Defense Phase: Perform four moves and four actions with defenders.&#10;     Clearing Phase: Assault counters inside the building remove defenders.&#10;     Escape Phase (Attack 3 only): Defenders escape from the building.&#10;&#10;&#10;The game ends at the end of the turn when you draw the enemy fire engine card during Attack 3. At the end of the game, your score is based on the number of noncombatants and postal workers that survived the attacks.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Each player starts at level 1 and the winner is the first player to reach level 10. Players can acquire familiar D&amp;D style character classes during the game which determine to some extent the cards they can play.&#10;&#10;There are two types of cards - treasure and encounters. Each turn the current players 'kicks down the door' - drawing an encounter card from the deck. Usually this will involve battling a monster. Monsters have their own levels and players must try and overcome it using the levels, weapons and powers they have acquired during the game or run away. Other players can chose to help the player or hinder by adding extra monsters to the encounter. Defeating a monster will usually result in drawing treasure cards and acquiring levels. Being defeated by a monster results in &quot;bad stuff&quot; which usually involves losing levels and treasure.&#10;&#10;Note: The Dutch first edition and German second edition include the first expansion for this game, Munchkin Bites! 2: Pants Macabre. The same applies to Italian edition.&#10;&#10;",

When all players run out of cultists, the Action phase ends, and players recover their cultists, freeing up the board sites for the next Action phase. Victory is determined when the last Elder Sign blocking your Great Old One is shattered, and at this point everyone totes up points. Different resources are worth different amounts, but the most valuable are the Elder Signs.&#10;&#10;Driving the game are the player's need to recruit more cultists &amp; gather more resources, balanced against his need to shatter Elder Signs and protect himself against the deadly investigator raids. Unusual among worker placement games, the cult board can be swapped out between games, for a different experience. The Cthulhu cult board does not play the same as the Black Goat cult board, and they require different tactics and planning.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Coin Age is a microgame for two players that's played with a single card and pocket change. Players take turns placing coins on a map to control spaces, outmaneuver their opponent, and score victory points.&#10;&#10;Coin Age uses an innovative &quot;coin slap&quot; mechanism to determine available actions. On a player's turn, they take one of each of their remaining types of coins in hand (one quarter, one nickel, one penny, and one dime), shakes them up, then slaps them on the table. Based on the number of coins that match their &quot;side&quot;, players can then either place coins on the map, move previously placed coins to an adjacent space, or remove them altogether. When placing coins, players may also place their coins on top of the opponent's coins if their size/rank is smaller, so while a quarter will give you the most victory points at the end of the game, it has the highest probability of being covered by your opponent.&#10;&#10;Coin Age is a quick-playing area control game with lots of player interaction and a bit of push-your-luck gameplay.&#10;&#10;",

The game is intended for two players but is also suitable for solitaire and team play. The game is played in a semi-interactive way, as only one Division of the active player is activated to conduct actions at the same time and the inactive player sometimes can have one of his Divisions react to specific threats and interrupt the enemy's actions.&#10;&#10;The Situation&#10;While Operation Market Garden was in the final stage of preparation, Lieutenant general Hodges led the leading elements of the First Army towards the Westwall fortified line south of Aachen.

    "description": "Operation Dauntless: The Battles for Fontenay and Rauray, France, June 1944, is a wargame that covers the actions of the British 49th Infantry Division (a.k.a &quot;The Polar Bears&quot;) near Caen during Operation Martlet (called Operation Dauntless by the British at the time of the battle).  Opposing these lads are elements of the 12th SS Panzer Division &quot;Hitlerjugend&quot; (Hitler Youth) and Panzer Lehr&mdash;elite panzergrenadier units.  The goal of the British division is to seize the town of Fontenay, then press onward to secure the high ground near Rauray in time for the impending Operation Epsom, to be launched the next morning.&#10;&#10;The game by designer Mark Mokszycki uses the same system as Red Winter, his game on the Battle of Tolvaj&auml;rvi  from the Russo-Finnish Winter War of 1939.  Scale is grand tactical: 90 minutes per game turn, 425 yards per hex, and mostly company sized infantry units with platoon sized armor units. Gone are the Winter War specific rules such as ski movement and night raids, and in their place we have a more detailed armor/anti-tank subsystem.  There are lots of tanks on both sides in this one!&#10;&#10;Rules for Operation Dauntless include the 12th SS Fanatical Defense Table, British sabot ammo, tank destroyers, self-propelled infantry guns and artillery, combat engineers, troop transport, British air strikes, German nuisance raids (night bombings), infantry anti-tank weapons, German ammo shortage, and abstracted effects of the immense British opening barrage by 650 guns.&#10; Terrain is a mixture of corn and wheat fields, orchards, woods, heavy and light bocage, and small stone farm houses and villages.  The Germans begin the game dug in, and they may place a limited number of fortifications during setup.&#10;&#10;The game includes a multi-day campaign as well as several shorter scenarios. The Germans are on the defensive overall, but they are armed to the teeth with many powerful panzer formations&mdash;including Panzer IVs, Panthers, and Tigers&mdash;and will find themselves able to counterattack frequently and effectively. Some of the shorter scenarios feature the Germans on the offensive to recapture lost ground.&#10;&#10;The game was designed for two players, but works very well solitaire.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Turn: 90 minutes&#10;Map: 425 yards per hex&#10;Unit: Platoon to Company&#10;&#10;Game Contents:&#10;Three counter sheets of 528 5/8&quot; counters (roughly 2 sheets of unit counters and 1 sheet of markers)&#10;One 22 x 34&quot; map&#10;One 36 page Rule Book&#10;One 28 page Play Book (includes full-color illustrated examples of play, Comparisons to Red Winter, Tips &amp; Strategies, and counter manifest)&#10;One 56 page Scenario Book (includes 11 tutorials, ~15 scenarios, and optional rules)&#10;One 48 page Reference Book (includes designer's notes and complete Order of Battle)&#10;Two Identical Player Aid Cards (foldout, 4 sided)&#10;One Player Air Card 2 (Optional rules)(1 sided)&#10;One British Reinforcement Card (8.5 x 11&quot;, 1 sided)&#10;One German Reinforcement Card (11 x 17&quot;, 1 sided)&#10;One Flowchart card (double-sided with LOS and Armor Reaction Cycle aids)&#10;One Campaign Game Setup &amp; Vehicle Identification Card (2 sided)&#10;One Turn Track Card (Turn Track A: June 16-18 on front, Turn Track B: June 25-27 on back)&#10;One Information &amp; Turn Phase Track Card (1 sided)&#10;One Tutorial Getting Started #1: Infantry Card (2 sided)&#10;One Tutorial Getting Started #2: Armor Card (2 sided)&#10;Three 6-sided dice&#10;Three 10-sided dice&#10;&#10;Complexity: Medium (similar to Red Winter or a tad more complex)&#10;Solitaire Suitability: High&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Set in the titular city in the 16th century, Venice lets players take the role of wealthy, influential merchants as they ride their gondolas up and down the city's canals, train their assistants, complete contracts, and leverage their influence to gain political power. But business is anything but usual. As they broker contracts and flirt with crime, merchants must avoid arousing the suspicion of the Venetian Inquisition, lest they find themselves arrested and their businesses shut down.&#10;&#10;In the game, players move their two gondolas around the board. When they move a gondola, they may activate the assistants they have placed previously on any building they pass, but they may train (and improve the capabilities of) only the one on which they end their movement. Assistants allow you to gain resources, trade, make money, and take an array of other actions depending on the buildings to which they are assigned. When resources are made, they are placed in the gondola, and these will be used to fulfill lucrative contracts.&#10;&#10;Space is limited on the city's canals, however, and each time you pass another merchant's boat, gossip will spread, raising your suspicion level with the Inquisition. Lower your suspicion with visits and donations to the church, or academic institutions &mdash; or throw caution to the wind and engage in unsavory activities for money or information. During the game, being such a well-known merchant can be a boon to your political career, but at game end, the most suspicious player will be made an example of by the Inquisition &mdash; blocking your victory even if you have the most points.&#10;&#10;Includes solo mode by David Turczi and Xavi Bordes&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

There are also a number of Gold and Silver bonus tiles.

You can enhance your score by skillful use of the Gold and Silver bonus tiles and by cunningly interlacing &lsquo;sunrays&rsquo; and &lsquo;moonbeams&rsquo; with your other scoring rows. If it all seems to be going desperately wrong, you can dispose of unwanted tiles by placing them in your &lsquo;Scrap Yard&rsquo;. But beware - an &lsquo;untidy&rsquo; scrapyard can cost you penalty points!&#10;&#10;When playing on the Orchid board, choose either the &lsquo;sun&rsquo; or &lsquo;moon&rsquo; tiles.

    "description": "The ink was hardly dry on the documents following the partition of British India in 1947 before war broke out between India and Pakistan. Since the partition, four major wars and numerous smaller conflicts have been waged over much of the same ground. In 1947, 1965, 1971, and 1999 India and Pakistan fought in the mountains of Kashmir and on the plains of the Punjab region to the south.  Today, both sides are armed with thousands of armored vehicles, hundreds of advanced aircraft, and dozens of nuclear weapons.  With tensions high and both sides heavily armed, another conflict may be just a matter of time.&#10;&#10;Next War: India-Pakistan, the next volume in GMT's series of Next War games and a follow-on to&#226;&#128;&#175; Next War: Korea, allows players to fight a near future war between India and Pakistan.&#10;&#10;Due to the nature of a potential conflict, only a portion of the Indo-Pakistani border is featured so that the fighting centers around what it always has: the fate of the Indian state of Jammu &amp; Kashmir. Special rules govern such things as the expanded role bridges play in the region play as well as the fact that both sides in the conflict are nuclear-armed nations. The People's Republic of China and the United States can make an appearance, but they might withdraw in the event of a nuclear exchange. The question is: will this war settle once and for all who will control northwest India?&#10;&#10;Note: the Next War series is not an introductory wargame. Rather, we have intended herein to create a system (and a series) that will allow detailed study of modern warfare in various venues as well as engaging gameplay. That said, the Standard Game rules encompass a fairly straightforward rule set that will, we think, be considered &quot;easy to learn&quot; by experienced wargamers. So, players who choose to play Standard Game scenarios can have a relatively quick game when that's what suits them. The real flavor of a war in the theatre, however, comes through in the Advanced Game, where you get much more control over airpower and can more clearly see each side's strengths and weaknesses. For players who want a &quot;mini-monster game&quot; experience, playing the Advanced Game Campaign Scenarios with some or all of the optional rules will definitely &quot;deliver.&quot;&#10;&#10;Ownership of&#226;&#128;&#175;Next War: Korea&#226;&#128;&#175;will NOT be required to play.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Units&#10; Ground units in Next War: India-Pakistan represent the brigades, support units, and divisions of the armies of the India, Pakistan, China, and the United States. All ground units are rated for their attack and defense strengths, movement capabilities, and unit efficiency.&#10;&#10;Air units represent fighter, bomber, and attack squadrons of the major combatants and are rated for All-Weather Capabilities as well as their range, average pilot skill, and their abilities in Air-to-Air Combat, Close Air Support, and Strike missions.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Maps and TerrainThe game's map represents the area in and around the Punjab district of Pakistan and the Indian state of Jammu &amp; Kashmir at a scale of roughly 7.5 miles per hex. The map stretches from edge of The Great Indian Desert to just inside the Himalayas and encompasses portions of both sides of the border.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Game SystemA game turn is generally composed of:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Weather Determination. Bad weather can severely hamper air operations and can significantly slow ground operations. &#10;     Initiative Determination and Air/Naval Phase, wherein Air Superiority levels and air availability are determined. &#10;     Special Operations Phases&#226;&#128;&#175;in the Advanced Game allowing players to utilize their special operators in various recon and raid missions behind enemy lines. &#10;     Strike Phases&#226;&#128;&#175;in the Advanced Game allowing players to launch air strikes, cruise missiles, artillery and tactical nuclear weapon strikes. &#10;     One or more&#226;&#128;&#175;Movement and Combat Phases&#226;&#128;&#175;that allow both sides to move, react, and fight, with an advantage to the Initiative player on non-Contested turns &#10;     Arrival of Reinforcements and Replacements &#10;     Victory Determination &#10;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;CombatCombat&#226;&#128;&#175;resolution examines not only unit strengths but also unit efficiency (representing training, doctrine, and morale), as well as the terrain where the combat takes place. The CRT tends to be very bloody in nature, reflecting what we believe will be a degree of attritional warfare early due to the lethality of modern weapons. As in many games, casualties represent not only actual combat losses but also losses of unit cohesion brought about by the rapid pace with which modern armies are able to engage and exploit on the battlefield.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;NukesIn this installment, players will have the option, depending on game situation and a die roll to secure release authorization for and use tactical nuclear weapons in the playing area. Use of such weapons, however, could cause your international allies to leave the theater, so be careful!&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;ScenariosThere are several Standard Game scenarios. Some are small and focus on limited objectives while others are variations of a campaign game encompassing the entire map.&#10;&#10;In a break from the standard set in Next War: Korea(and its follow-on Next War: Taiwan), the scenarios in Next War: India-Pakistan posit specific at-start situations and objectives (or victory conditions).  In some scenarios Pakistan is the aggressor while in others the Indian side is on the attack, in all cases there are varying levels of Chinese and United States intervention.&#10;&#10;The International Posture Matrix&#226;&#128;&#175;&agrave; la&#226;&#128;&#175;Flashpoint: Golan &#226;&#128;&#147; The Fifth Arab-Israeli War&#226;&#128;&#175;is still present to allow players to experiment with a variety of intervention options for the US and PRC.&#10;&#10;In &#226;&#128;&#175;Next War: India-Pakistan, Jammu &amp; Kashmir is once again aflame. Can you, as the Islamic Republic of Pakistan's commander, conquer Kashmir and hold it against the enemy? Can you, as the Republic of India's commander, attack and defeat the enemy without the conflict going nuclear? And what will happen in the international community while all this is going on?

    "description": "(from GMT website:)&#10;&#10; The Great Battles of History series ventures back into the mists of time: the Bronze Age, or the Age of the Chariot. From approximately 1700 BC to 1200 BC (which was the abrupt end of the Bronze Age) the chariot reigned supreme on the battlefield. It was the first modern weapons system, and chariots controlled most of warfare until actual cavalry appeared in the middle of the Iron Age.&#10;  &#10;But how did chariots work as a tactical weapons system? There is no complete historical agreement on what exactly they did or how they were used, but Chariots of Fire will show you our view of their many applications - and many types of chariotry there were - providing GBoH players with the complete and definitive chariot rules. These rules cover combat and mobility from the first battle wagons of the Sumerians to the two-man, fast-moving light chariots of the Egyptians, often complete with their associated and specialized Runner Infantry, to the heavy 3-man Hittite wheels.&#10; To simulate these ancient tactical details Chariots of Fire presents you with nine battles:&#10;Sumer (ca 2320 BC) - featuring the legendary Sargon the Great&#10;Sekhmen (1875 BC)&#10;Megiddo (ca 1479 BC)&#10;Senzar (1470)&#10;The Astarpa (1312 BC)&#10;Kadesh (1300 BC)&#10;Nihriya (1230 BC)&#10;Babylon (1225 BC)&#10;and Troy (1200 BC) - including an extra: Homer's heros!&#10;&#10;And of armies Chariots of Fire has plenty, and a truly colorful bunch they are: Sumerians, Akkadians, all sorts of Egyptians, Canaanites, Hittites, Mitanni, Arzawans, Assyrians, Babylonians, and the Mycenaean Age Greeks.&#10;&#10;Game Features&#10;TIME SCALE     20 minutes per turn  &#10;MAP SCALE     100 yards per hex&#10;UNIT SCALE      350 men per mounted unit &#10;PLAYING TIME     1-3 hours&#10;&#10;&#10;(from BGG description:)&#10;&#10;Historical Note: The period following The Bronze Age, from what is known as The Catastrophe of ca. 1200 BC to the rise of the Greek city-states, is almost totally devoid of any sort of information, and that includes archaeological  remains. It is the true Dark Age of history. When the area emerged from that era, warfare had undergone major changes and chariots had been relegated to the sidelines.&#10;&#10;Three errata counters for Chariots of Fire were included in C3i #24.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Alexandros is an abstract strategy by Leo Colovini, thematically inspired by the military expansion of Alexander the Great. It includes the &quot;triggered scoring for all&quot; mechanism, which can be considered a trademark of the designer, implemented in many of his games. It forces players to evaluate their actions in relation to what other players can earn.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to have more points than other players when the trail/border markers are depleted or someone scores 100 points first.&#10;&#10;Gameplay is driven by cards, used for all actions. Clockwise, players are first obliged to move the figure representing Alexandros across a triangular grid. They do this by playing cards with symbols matching those on destination spots. This is the core concept of the game - when the figure of Alexandros is moved, it leaves a trail of borders behind it. Soon, these borders begin to form provinces composed of triangular spaces: either with symbols or empty.&#10;&#10;After moving Alexandros, players either build their hand of cards by drawing them, take over provinces or trigger scorings if the situation on the board suits them.&#10;&#10;Players can occupy provinces by playing cards from their hand and placing tokens representing their leaders on spaces with corresponding symbols. When a scoring is triggered, provinces earn points equal to the number of empty spaces in them. Players can take over empty provinces and/or those occupied by other players. Each player has only four generals and placing them costs valuable cards - the game requires careful hand management and point-to-point movement - to create worthy provinces for scoring.&#10;&#10;Awarded title of &quot;Best Family Strategy Game&quot; by Games Magazine in 2005.&#10;&#10;",

Each ship is represented on an individual large card with counters showing current contact status and damage.&#10;&#10;Each player plays cards to increase their &quot;contact level&quot; relative to their opponent. Contact level abstractly represents relative position and sonar readings. It is possible for one ship to have a better contact on his enemy than the enemy has on him.

    "description": "Napoleon at Leipzig, 1813 - His Grande Arm&eacute;e shattered on the Russian Steppes, Napoleon tries to regain the initiative in Germany. His former allies Prussia and Austria turn traitor and attack him. Tsarist Russia sends a massive army across the Vistula into Europe proper.&#10;&#10;Draining every reserve the French Empire has left, Napoleon gathers his loyal Rhinelanders, Italians, Saxons and Poles. Seizing the initiative in the Spring, he defeats the Allied Coalition at Lutzen, and then at Bautzen, and then again at Dresden. But these are not the complete victories his desperate situation demands. Small defeats of his Generals (Oudinot on August 23rd at Grossbeeren, Mcdonald on August 26th at Katzbach, Vandamme on August 29-30th at Kulm and Ney on September 6th at Dennewitz) brought the strength to decline...&#10;&#10;Now, with his strength sapped, Napoleon recoils to Leipzig. Like wolves, his enemies surround the place and converge. . . . Napoleon at Leipzig 3rd Edition retains its classic starting situation with only one wing of the French Army on the map. Later, Napoleon leads the main body of La Grande Arm&eacute;e, 175,000 strong, into a position which Marshal Marmont later described as lying &quot;at the bottom of a funnel.&quot; As 300,000 Allied troops converge on Leipzig during the succeeding days, the French task is to crush one or more of the enemy armies, or successfully retire the cream of their army across the sole remaining bridge spanning the Elster.&#10;&#10;Scenarios and the Campaign Game can begin on the 14th, 16th, or 18th of October, 1813. The Standard, Campaign and Grand Tactical rules have been completely revised to reflect the latest findings in Napoleonic scholarship.&#10;&#10;A totally new map, based on fresh sources, accurately portrays the terrain around Leipzig, emphasizing the superb cavalry terrain to the south. A Study Folder with the classic narrative by noted author F. Lorraine Petrie, along with the Order of Battle and set-up for the three stages of the six-day battle, is also included.&#10;&#10;The game has 4 editions.  &#10;The first one was produced by Kevin Zucker's own &quot;Operational Studies Group&quot; company.  &#10;Later 3 more editions had been published, all by Clash of Arms (comments to the different editions had been made by Ed Wimble): &#10;- [2ed] 1988 - new counters. Map &amp; box uses old negatives but with a different color scheme and paper. Rules pretty much the same with a flourish here and there (such as the added steps for the Guard counters).&#10;- [3ed] 1992 - this was certainly just a reprint, as there was no new copyright for it&#10;- [4ed] 1996 - new map and artwork based on Ed Wimble's visit of Leipzig. New box and artwork. New rules: Kevin Zucker redesigned them. Counters: The half sheet reworked.&#10;&#10;Thereafter GMT proclaimed a combined GMT-OSG 5ed for a P-500. &#10;In 2012 Kevin Zucker announced that the 5th Edition will now be a sole OSG product and should see publication in 2012/ 2013. &#10;Note: the 5th Edition can be found here: Napoleon at Leipzig (Fifth Edition)&#10;&#10;GAME SYSTEM: &#10;Series: The Library of Napoleonic Battles (OSG) - formerly known as the &quot;Napoleon's Last Battles (NLB-)Series&quot; &#10;- scale = 480m/hex, &#10;- time = 1hour/GT,&#10;- strength = 500-800 men/SP.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Turn: 1-3 hours&#10;Hex: 525 yards / 480 meters&#10;Units: Battery to Division&#10;&#10;Game Inventory (Operational Studies Group version):&#10;Two 22 x 34&quot; 6-color mapsheets&#10;One dual-side printed countersheet (400 1/2&quot; counters - 90 of which are blanks)&#10;One 8-page Napoleon at Leipzig rules booklet&#10;One 32-page Napoleon at Leipzig study folder booklet&#10;One side-printed errata  card&#10;One 6-sided die&#10;&#10;Complexity: Medium&#10;Solitaire Suitability: Medium&#10;Players: 1 or more&#10;Playing Time: 1-6 Hours&#10;&#10;",

Evil Masterminds like Loki and Red Skull lead a horde of powerful Super Villains, planning dark Schemes to destroy the Marvel Cinematic Universe! Only you can stop them, leading awesome Marvel Super Heroes like Captain America, Iron Man, and Thor!&#10;&#10;In this game for 1-5 players, each player starts with their own deck of basic Hero cards. At the start of your turn, you play the top card of the Villain Deck, showing how Villains invade the city, capture Bystanders, and create special events. Then you play Hero cards from your hand to generate Attack, Recruit Points, and special abilities. You attack with your Heroes to defeat Villains. You use Recruit Points to recruit better Heroes to add to your deck.&#10;&#10;Whenever your deck runs out of cards, you shuffle your discard pile to make a new deck, including all the new Heroes you recruited. This way your deck gets stronger and stronger over time. Build up enough Power and you can defeat the evil Mastermind! But be careful: if the players don&rsquo;t defeat the Mastermind quickly enough, then the Mastermind will complete their dark Scheme and win the game for evil!&#10;&#10;In Legendary: Marvel Studios Phase 1, the Avengers are back in a new setting with images straight from the Phase 1 movies of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (Iron Man, Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2, Thor, Captain America: The First Avenger, Avengers). Black Widow, Iron Man, Captain America and more face off against the Villains of the first six movies. Three Masterminds including the all new Iron Monger and his Iron Foes try to complete their evil schemes. This nearly 400 card sets comes with a full color rulebook and an updated playmat.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

The goods brought back to Amsterdam at great peril and cost are rapidly growing merchant wealth and increasing trade.

    "description": "Europe Divided - a game of an expansionist Europe, a resurgent Russia, and a new Cold War&#10;&#10;The end of the Cold War ushered in a new age of European expansion. Central and Eastern Europe had emerged from dictatorships and wanted to consolidate their democracies. They sought European integration to ensure they would not fall back into the Russian sphere of influence. Russia &mdash; a shell of its former power as the Soviet Union &mdash; could do nothing to slow the European expansion.&#10;&#10;&#10;But then things changed.&#10;&#10;&#10;Oil prices increased, bolstering Russia's economy. Putin came to power, and despite political discontent in Russia, his popularity remained strong. In 2008, war broke out between Russia and the NATO-aspirant, former Soviet country of Georgia. Russia's resurgence had begun, exemplified by the 2014 annexation of Crimea and invasion of eastern Ukraine.&#10;&#10;&#10;In the game, you control of one of the two powers: Europe (controlling both NATO and the European Union) or Russia. Europe is powerful and rich, but bureaucratic and slow to react. Russia lacks Europe's resources, but can respond rapidly.&#10;&#10;&#10;Players score victory points by having dominant influence in contested countries in Central Europe, Eastern Europe, and the Caucasus. They can also score victory points by bringing key historical events to fruition. Gameplay is rich with history and includes today's potential flashpoints, but it features a fast-playing card-driven core mechanism. Players use cards associated with countries they control to establish political and military influence, gain financial resources, and deploy their military presence. An elegant deck-manipulation mechanism weakens players' decks as they increase their influence, creating tension between seeking to expand and overreaching.&#10;&#10;&#10;Will the Velvet Revolution result in the split of the Czech Republic and Slovakia? How will the Bosnian War end? The players will decide the fate of history throughout this period of Europe Divided.&#10;&#10;",
