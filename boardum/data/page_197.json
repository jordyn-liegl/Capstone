Sailors climb the rigging as you command your pilot to steer windward, taking the weather gage on the closest ship- gaining superior position. As your gunners open fire with cannon, you call out to your marines to prepare for boarding!&#10;&#10;Scalawag! is a competitive card game for 3-8 players. Each player is the captain of their own warship with the goal of eliminating all other players (or teams during Allegiance Play). Game play consists of a player issuing one Captain&rsquo;s Order each turn, generally allowing them to either gather additional Compass Points (the game currency) or spend Compass Points to attack their opponents.&#10;&#10;Players support their Captain&rsquo;s Orders by declaring Crew. As a player&rsquo;s Crew Cards are kept hidden from others and bluffing is allowed, knowing when to bluff and when to call a bluff (by calling out Scalawag!) is an important element to successful play.&#10;&#10;",

The key to success in this game, is how players allocate suitable abilities to their workers!&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;&#230;&#149;&#166;&#231;&#133;&#140;&#233;&#161;&#158;&#230;&#175;&#148;&#228;&#186;&#134;&#229;&#148;&#144;&#230;&#156;&#157;&#230;&#153;&#130;&#230;&#156;&#159;&#228;&#184;&#173;&#229;&#156;&#139;&#230;&#149;&#166;&#231;&#133;&#140;&#229;&#156;&#176;&#229;&#141;&#128;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#231;&#185;&#129;&#230;&#166;&#174;&#231;&#148;&#159;&#230;&#180;&#187;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#231;&#142;&#169;&#229;&#174;&#182;&#229;&#176;&#135;&#230;&#137;&#174;&#230;&#188;&#148;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#228;&#189;&#141;&#229;&#176;&#143;&#229;&#156;&#176;&#228;&#184;&#187;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#232;&#166;&#170;&#232;&#186;&#171;&#233;&#171;&#148;&#233;&#169;&#151;&#232;&#142;&#171;&#233;&#171;&#152;&#231;&#170;&#159;&#229;&#163;&#129;&#231;&#149;&#171;&#229;&#146;&#140;&#233;&#155;&#149;&#229;&#161;&#145;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#229;&#137;&#181;&#228;&#189;&#156;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#228;&#187;&#165;&#229;&#143;&#138;&#231;&#181;&#178;&#231;&#182;&#162;&#228;&#185;&#139;&#232;&#183;&#175;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#231;&#185;&#129;&#230;&#166;&#174;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#233;&#129;&#138;&#230;&#136;&#178;&#229;&#133;&#177;&#230;&#156;&#137;16&#229;&#128;&#139;&#233;&#162;&#168;&#230;&#160;&#188;&#229;&#144;&#132;&#231;&#149;&#176;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#232;&#181;&#183;&#229;&#167;&#139;&#232;&#168;&#173;&#231;&#189;&#174;&#229;&#140;&#133;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#230;&#175;&#143;&#230;&#172;&#161;&#233;&#129;&#138;&#230;&#136;&#178;&#229;&#143;&#170;&#233;&#156;&#128;&#233;&#129;&#184;&#229;&#143;&#150;&#229;&#133;&#182;&#228;&#184;&#173;&#231;&#154;&#132;3&#229;&#128;&#139;&#229;&#133;&#182;&#229;&#175;&#166;&#232;&#168;&#173;&#231;&#189;&#174;&#229;&#140;&#133;&#229;&#141;&#179;&#229;&#143;&#175;&#233;&#129;&#138;&#230;&#136;&#178;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#228;&#184;&#141;&#229;&#144;&#140;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#231;&#181;&#132;&#229;&#144;&#136;&#229;&#184;&#182;&#228;&#190;&#134;&#232;&#182;&#133;&#231;&#180;&#154;&#229;&#164;&#154;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#233;&#129;&#138;&#230;&#136;&#178;&#233;&#171;&#148;&#233;&#169;&#151;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#230;&#142;&#161;&#231;&#148;&#168;&#228;&#186;&#134;&#229;&#143;&#175;&#232;&#174;&#138;&#232;&#131;&#189;&#229;&#138;&#155;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#229;&#183;&#165;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#230;&#148;&#190;&#231;&#189;&#174;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#230;&#169;&#159;&#229;&#136;&#182;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#231;&#142;&#169;&#229;&#174;&#182;&#229;&#143;&#175;&#228;&#187;&#165;&#231;&#130;&#186;&#232;&#135;&#170;&#229;&#183;&#177;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#229;&#183;&#165;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#230;&#144;&#173;&#233;&#133;&#141;&#228;&#184;&#141;&#229;&#144;&#140;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#232;&#131;&#189;&#229;&#138;&#155;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#229;&#185;&#171;&#229;&#138;&#169;&#228;&#189;&#160;&#232;&#180;&#143;&#229;&#190;&#151;&#233;&#129;&#138;&#230;&#136;&#178;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#229;&#136;&#169;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher (Chinese)&#10;&#10;",

Each round, the players bid on flowers in the flower clock using their fireflies. They can also plant a flower from their hand into one of their gardens, secretly bid a royal firefly, and also discard one of the cards in their had to the compost heap so they can bid a second firefly on the flower clock. Each of the six types of beautifully colored flowers has a special ability which players can utilize to form combos and add benefits to their play. Additionally, orchid/weed cards can be bid on, and these allow players to add bonuses to their gardens or attack an opponent's garden.&#10;&#10;A round ends once all players have taken their turns and drawn back up to three flowers in their hand and the sundial has turned one card clockwise to see which flowers are coming off the flower clock that round. Once all the flowers have been exhausted from the potting shed (i.e., the draw deck), the game ends and points are totaled for flower beds created to see who wins and becomes the next royal gardener.&#10;&#10;",

But &ldquo;the System&rdquo; is hard at work too, maneuvering to crush your efforts through tactics like setting up surveillance, making arrests, or causing infighting.&#10;&#10;In order to win, players must collaborate to build a movement that scores more victories than the system. To do this, players spend supporter tokens to use Movement Cards that allow them to grow their movement power on the ten different locations on the board (such as Workplaces, Campuses, Internet), take down the System&rsquo;s power, as well as help their fellow players gain more supporters and cards. Players can strategize together by playing Movement Cards with matching symbols and starting a &ldquo;chain of events,&rdquo; which increases their impact. As your movement gains power, the system will retaliate with more cards of its own. Everyone loses if any one player runs out of supporter tokens, or if the system scores too many victories.&#10;&#10;Rise Up also comes with two versions with a double sided board: one for more experienced game players, and one for novices as well as younger children. Rise Up is ethically manufactured.&#10;&#10;",

Turn order is reset for each round, with the player with fewest VPs going first. Players accumulate VPs according to the size of their railroad network(s) and by playing their route cards.&#10;&#10;The game ends at the end of a segment where one of the players has accumulated at least 100 VPs.&#10;&#10;Robber Barons has some luck, with timing of route card plays being the most important factor, followed closely by strategic railroad building.

During their journey they will face many foes, collect amazing loot, befriend powerful companions, and, of course - fight each other.&#10;&#10;The hero that brings Queen Victoria to the Buckingam Palace will be the ultimate winner. It may be the strongest player, it may be the smartest one; it might be the one who found the Queen, but it also might be the one who nicked her at the end of the road. Well, whoever it may be - the winner can be only one!&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "2048, Earth: The corrupt government has lost grip on Rain City, a brooding metropolis where crime runs amok despite the patrolling police squads. This desperate battle has recently seen a new player, a secret Agency of Bounty Hunters, attempting to control the endless assaults on inner city life.&#10;&#10;Your task: Defeat and arrest criminals, defuse high-tech bombs that threaten to destroy city districts, and prevent assassins from completing their destructive path. You are one of the members of this secretive brotherhood of justice. So...are you ready to survive the crime waves in the big city and uncover the infiltrating androids amongst your team that plan a revolt?&#10;&#10;Rogue Agent is a tense cyberpunk adventure game that pitches players against underground networks. The game features detailed plastic miniatures, a large variety of unique criminals to defeat, special icon-driven custom dice, and two different game play modes.&#10;&#10;In Rogue Agent, players control an agent working for the shady corporation known as &quot;The Agency&quot;, created to control Rain City's crime rate, which has rapidly outpaced the capabilities of the regular police force. Players win the game by obtaining the most power over the city in a race against the game system that creates a living city in which crime and other challenges await at every corner.&#10;&#10;Each round consists of an action phase, which is preceded by an upkeep phase. During this action phase, players score power by successfully eliminating assassins, turning in crime bosses, and defusing high-tech bombs that threaten to destroy whole districts. Through investigation of city areas, players gather resources that will be vital for survival. Positioning collaborators in the different locations of the city aids agents in overcoming confrontations with local thugs. Meanwhile, the city police squad is hot on your trail, hoping to contain the illegal side jobs that agents are known for. The Agency, however, has its own air defenses it can call in for support.&#10;&#10;Players can scout locations in search for valuable resources that will help them upgrade their abilities, to get more control over the challenges in the game. As the game develops, agents can upgrade their vehicle, weapon and scout abilities as well as gather information about the true identities of other agents. There might be traitors within the Agency. Some of you might be android agents, secretly planning a revolt. Through careful investigation, players can gather intelligence about the true identity of other players. As the game progresses, traitors amongst the agents could be revealed in the form of androids. These agents have access to new victory conditions &ndash; destroying key locations holding information about android production and eliminating human agents &ndash; in a deadly race for control of the city. The first player to reach eight power wins.&#10;&#10;Rogue Agent is a fast-playing, easy-to-learn adventure, resource management, and risk management game using fun, streamlined icon-driven custom dice mechanisms. The Living City System creates a dynamic board with characters and challenges in constant motion, creating unique situations with each play and making Rain City come alive on your gaming table. No trip to Rain City will be the same!&#10;&#10;",

Points can be used as moves or attacks.&#10;&#10;Soccer teams are purchased separately, so that players can choose their favorites.

    "description": "This is a simulation of battleship combat, which abstracts each ship to four numeric attributes: attack, defense, speed and range.&#10;What you get is a thick paper map (22&quot; x 16&quot;) showing some coast outlines in different colors, 200 &frac12;&quot; cardboard counters, a 12-page rule-book and two dice. The counters represent WW2 battleships, cruisers and destroyers of various nationalities, plus markers to show ship speed and direction, targets, and damage inflicted.&#10;&#10;[From the back of the box]&#10;Salvo is a fast paced, exciting simulation of surface Battleship actions of the Second World War. Practically every class of battleship that fought is represented, such as the Bismark, Iowa, Yamato and King George V. Cruisers and destroyers are represented by screening units. Scenarios include destruction of the French fleet at Mers-ek-Kebir, Suriago Strait, Second Guadalcanal, Calabria, North Cape and the Bismarck encounters. Hypothetical scenarios include such things as what might have happened if Halsey had deployed Lee's battleships to San Bernardino Strait during Leyte Gulf.&#10;&#10;All the essentials of naval warfare are recreated, including gunnery, torpedoes, damage control and maneuvers. Also included are special rules depicting friendly fire, mines, command control, crew quality and shore batteries. Your playing skill will determine leadership quality! The map illustrates islands and land masses used in certain scenarios. Each hex equals 2000 yards and each game turn represents 10 minutes of real time. The game mechanics require no &quot;paperwork&quot; on the part of the players, for the resolution of combat or the execution of movement.&#10;&#10;",

However, you have only one minute to do so, and you are not allowed to speak...and you can't see your own cards &mdash; only the cards of the other players! Can you give the right signals and interpret your teammates' signals correctly to play everything in time?&#10;&#10;To win, you need to complete six levels of play. For level 1, deal out ten cards from a deck numbered 1-40 as evenly as possible. Sort the cards face down (without showing anyone else) to stack the cards from low to high. Each player picks up their topmost card facing away from themselves so that it's visible to everyone else, then someone starts the timer. Whoever has the lowest card must play it. How will they know? Tell them with your eyes! If they play the card correctly, they pick up their next card, then you all figure out who plays next; if not, restart the level, losing the game if you fail a second time.&#10;&#10;If you complete the level by playing all cards correctly, add the special cards for level 2 &mdash; smile cards &mdash; and deal 13 cards. Special cards can be stacked anywhere in a player's pile other than the topmost card. When a player holds a special card, that's considered the lowest card in play. Each level adds new special cards, such as the mirror and a second copy of some number cards, and more cards dealt to players. Make it through 25 cards in one minute at level 6, and you win!&#10;&#10;",

Players may decide to launch a direct nuclear attack on the the other player, attempting to destroy the enemy cities with missiles or bombers while defending his own with ABMs and interceptors.

Unimaginable market potential is now within arm&rsquo;s reach, just waiting to be exploited. In the dawn of a new aggressive space race, conflict is inevitable!&#10;&#10;Orbital Conflict is a card game where each player during several turns build and modify a space station and manage its resources. Each turn is divided into three phases. Draw, Main and Combat phase.&#10;&#10;In the draw phase each player takes turn drawing two station cards and two investor cards. When all have done the draw phase the Main phase begins.&#10;&#10;In the main phase each player takes turn playing station cards from the hand to the player's station. They can either be played as a standalone module or extend existing once into more advanced modules. Cards can have production, requirements, attack, defense and victory points. The player will try to build a station that meets the demands of the two investor cards draw in previous phase. Investor are worth different amount of victory points, some are easy to claim while others require a big station. Some cards even has special abilities that apply when part of a station. When all have done the main phase the combat phase begins. Unclaimed investor cards are discarded (new once are draw in the draw phase).&#10;&#10;In the combat phase a player may choose to attack another player's station using modules with attack values or discard cards from the hand that gives additional attacks.&#10;&#10;When the last card in the draw pile has been drawn a last turn is played. Afterwards each player counts victory points from claimed investors and from the station. The player with the highest amount wins the game.&#10;&#10;Noteworthy mechanics are no hand limit, that station cards can extend by being placed on top or below existing once. Claimed investor cards have a mini-game like mechanic where they are pushed from the right or left.&#10;&#10;Orbital conflict balance station building, light resource management with aggressive combat and point gathering. There is no player elimination and stations can be destroyed and rebuilt several times during a game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "When the Civil War was taking place in America, an uprising broke out in Poland. The winter of 1863. Poland was captive, partitioned by three powers of that era &ndash; Austria, Prussia and Russia. Under the occupation of this last country, the embers of yet another revolt appeared and tore these lands for the next two years. Once again, the rebellious hearts of Poles were itching for a fight. This time there was no regular army. Armed with scythes and hunting weapons, Poles joined armed groups called parties to stand up to an unequal battle with the large Russian army. You yourself could stand at the head of one of these parties.&#10;&#10;1863 is an unusually dynamic card game designed for 2-4 players, in which our task is to put you in the role of an insurgent party. The party, which may include Scythemen, Shooters or elite troops of the Zouaves of Death, will engage the Muscovites in the historic battles of the January Uprising. We must take care that we have the right amount of ammunition, and make sure that none of our fellow players gain too many glory points. They decide which player wins the whole game.&#10;&#10;One begins the game having five Command Cards and Ammunition Chips. Each round starts by drawing commanders and issuing a battlefield with the Muscovite&rsquo;s card hidden beneath it. In each turn, players replenish their number of chips and cards. After this, the most important part of the game begins. It consists of adding the next military units and actions to battles or to other players, in order to break with military force all the units of the battlefield, along with the Muscovite card hidden beneath it. The battles are resolved when everyone has agreed not to add more cards. If players manage to surpass the total military forces of the battlefield and Muscovite, the skirmish has been won, and the players each receive glory points according to the size of their military contribution to it. So it pays to have the largest share in each battle. The game usually lasts until 6 skirmishes have been won. The glory points are then added up, and the winner of the game emerges.&#10;&#10;&#10;Zima roku 1863. Zniewolona Polska, pod zaborami trzech pot&#196;&#153;g tamtego okresu - Austrii, Prus i Rosji.

    "description": "From the Decision Games' website:&#10;&#10;The initial onslaught of the Germans' Ardennes offensive, in December 1944, overran numerous US positions all along the front line, though the Germans simply bypassed other stubbornly defended locations so as to maintain their momentum. The small town of Bastogne, however, with its strategically critical road junctions, became the lynchpin of the entire campaign. The Germans soon realized Bastogne had to be captured; so they set out to assault the outnumbered and surrounded American units there. The desperate defense of Bastogne therefore came to typify the entire Battle of the Bulge.&#10;&#10;Bastogne utilizes the new Fire &amp; Movement combat system that's designed so players can augment their units with &quot;support fire&quot; during the course of the battle. From anti-tank units to mortars, units can receive support assets to engage enemy positions and formations, allowing combat to develop at all levels. A single recon battalion, for example &mdash; perhaps supported by artillery &mdash; could be tasked to assault a lone enemy battalion of paratroopers defending a hamlet. As that attack gets underway, the recon battalion may find itself under the guns of enemy artillery. So more support fire will be necessary to take the hamlet, but assets are limited.&#10;&#10;In Bastogne, the attritional design of the new Combat Results Table simulates the true nature of battles in Europe. Units are typically two-sided formations that can incur casualties, accurately replicating the realities of combat and the high losses sustained by both sides during the actual fighting for Bastogne. Winning the battle is thus a matter of maneuver, firepower and asset management.&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Bastogne: The Desperate Defense, December 1944&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Welcome to your favorite holiday destination: Hawaii! Hawaii is a place to relax, drink lots of cocktails, and do nothing all day &mdash; except, of course, if you're a dictator. So what are dictators doing during their holidays? The same thing they do every day: Trying to take over the world! And what is a better place to start then that pesky &quot;Ol' Murica&quot;?&#10;&#10;Revenge of the Dictators is a way too competitive board game for 2-5 players. For the course of the game (yes, only during the game) each player becomes a vicious self-loving dictator. The ultimate goal of the game is easy: race across the map of North America, confront the President, take over the USA, and by doing so gain absolute control of America's forces and therefore the world! The only thing the dictators have to do to avoid eminent repercussions is disarm some nuclear facilities in order to remove the nuclear threat targeting their home countries. Sounds simple, right? The only thing is that dictators aren't used to working together &mdash; and in the end there can be only one Grandmaster &Uuml;ber Dictator of the world!&#10;&#10;In more detail, each player receives a dictator passport with a special ability unique to that dictator. The board shows a map of North America and is divided into four &quot;Nuclear Zones&quot;; each zone consists of several states, of which some include a nuclear facility. Every player receives a unique nuclear facility card for each nuclear zone.&#10;&#10;The game is divided into turns, and each turn consists of any possible combination of the following three actions: draw a Command card, play a Command card and Travel (maximum of once per turn). Players start in Hawaii and race across the map towards the White House in Washington DC. During the game, players can disarm any number of the nuclear facilities they received by rolling a die. In the end, the players have to confront the President at the White House and convince him to give up control of the U.S. by rolling a die. The chance of success drastically increases with each individually disarmed nuclear facility. Players are able to gain bonuses by disarming nuclear facilities of Nuclear Zone 4 (Canada and Mexico). In the meantime, the U.S. &mdash; that is, the game system itself &mdash; fights back by increasing the DEFCON level (with various effects) and with the use of random Founding Father cards which are included in the Command deck.&#10;&#10;",

To become a master kabuki actor, you must prove that you can identify all masks you see and remember where they are located, and Illusion will test those memory and recognition skills.&#10;&#10;The game lasts three rounds. To set up a round, each player takes 4-5 coins and someone shuffles the mask deck, then lays out the four actors around the deck. The deck consists of ten different types of masks, with five cards of each type.&#10;&#10;On a turn, the active player reveals the top card of the deck, then places it on top of one actors of her choice. If any opponent thinks that this type of mask is already present in this stack, he can yell &quot;Stop!&quot; If the accusation is true, the accuser takes as many coins from the active player as the number of masks of this type buried under the top card; if the accusation isn't true, then the accuser loses one coin, placing it out of the game.&#10;&#10;The round ends when one player has no coins remaining or the deck of cards has run out. Players tally their score for the round. The player with the most coins after three rounds wins.&#10;&#10;Kabuki features the same gameplay as Illusion, but players now try to track the different face paintings worn by kabuki artists.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "This game (the theme of which is viewed as controversial by some) combines elements of wargames, dexterity games and resource gathering games. While set somewhere Nazi-occupied in Europe at the end of World War II, the theme is not actually historical. Players take the role of factions associated with Allied Powers, each of which controls a team of commandos which have associated special powers in the game. Each player starts from a different starting position and then they race to reach concentration camps where they use a dreidel to knock over and kill Nazi guards and so free prisoners.&#10;&#10;The dreidel is also used in lieu of a d4 to allot movement points at the start of the turn; the amount of points allotted by a given spin corresponds to the traditional value of a spin in the game Dreidel. Different types of terrain on the movement board (covered by a grid of hexagons) require different amount of movement points. Some spaces also involve either aid and resources to be gathered or German patrols to be avoided. When a player lands on a concentration camp, his commandos raid the camp and kill guards.&#10;&#10;The box lid serves as a second board where figures representing guards are placed. A player who is raiding a concentration camp then uses the dreidel to knock over and kill guards. This leads to freeing prisoners from the camp.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to have freed the most prisoners when all concentration camps have been raided.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Theme&#10;In this simple card game players are Chicago era mobsters trying to make off with briefcases full of stolen loot. But careful, some of those briefcases might explode...&#10;&#10;Aim of the game&#10;Collecting the most points by collecting &quot;explosive cards&quot; with high values.&#10;&#10;Game play&#10;There are four sets of 8 cards, each with values from 1-8. Each player gets a set of one colour.&#10;The explosive cards show briefcases with positive values from 1-8 on one side, and bombs with negative values from 1-8 on the other side. They are shuffled and a number of explosive cards equal to the number of players plus one are laid out, positive side up. The remaining explosive cards are set aside.&#10;&#10;Players try to win as many positive explosive cards as possible. They take turns placing one of their number cards in front of one of the explosive cards. Whoever places the highest total on each explosive cards gets to take that card.&#10;&#10;Rules for card placement:&#10;&#10;     You cannot play another card directly on top of one of your own cards.&#10;     Each number can only be played once per explosive card, i.e. if another player has already played the 4 on an explosive card, you cannot play a 4 on the same explosive.&#10;     8 is an exception; there is no restriction on how many 8s can be played on one explosive card.&#10;&#10;&#10;If there are already 7 number cards on an explosive card, a player can blow it up by adding an 8th card. The explosive card is then turned from its briefcase side to the bomb side, and the player who wins it gets negative points instead.&#10;&#10;A round ends when all players have played all their cards. Card values on each explosive card are added up, with the last card in a row earning its owner an extra two points. The player with the most points in one row wins that explosive card.&#10;&#10;Players get back their number cards and a new round starts with new explosive cards.&#10;&#10;The game ends when all explosive cards are gone or there aren't enough left to start another round.&#10;Players add up the points from all their positive and negative explosive cards. The player with the highest total wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

The planet cannot give enough resources to sustain all living tribes. So the tribes will enter a trial to decide who will become the favored tribe. So, the goal of the game is to gain as much Godly favor as possible.&#10;&#10;Players are scavenging tribes that collect powerful gemstones during their turn on the floating islands of the Broken Planet. A player's standard turn consists of movement and gemstone collection. Movement is performed by secretly choosing an island number on the game board with your compass and then keeping it hidden until all other tribes have chosen a location. Afterwards, everybody reveals their location and performs the movement at the same time. Tribes will find different temples on the islands, each displaying the gemstone type that can be collected there. After adding the collected gems to their hand, a new turn starts and players repeat these steps.&#10;&#10;Each round, one tribe will enter the 'Offer Phase' and may discard gemstones cards for special actions.  These actions include building temples for unique effects, creating relics to gain Godly favor, or attacking other players with a divine strike. Each of these actions can gain favor in their own respective way. The offering player cannot move nor collect, but all other tribes can! The offering role is passed down clockwise each turn. The amount of discarded gemstones depends on the costs of the Offer Phase actions.&#10;&#10;All players play simultaneously! So it's key to see what gemstones other players need for their actions, and what gems they already have in order to predict their next moves.&#10;&#10;The game ends after X turns depending on the amount of players. When the last round has been played, each player counts their favor. The player with the most favor wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

Buy spices, send them to Europe, get rich, and succeed as big merchants!&#10;&#10;From Batavia (&#227;&#131;&#149;&#227;&#131;&#173;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#239;&#188;&#154;&#227;&#131;&#144;&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#131;&#180;&#227;&#130;&#163;&#227;&#130;&#162;) is a card-drafting game of sorts. In general, each player has a ship, and they'll place cargo cards on the ship until it's full, after which they get a new ship. Whoever fills three ships first wins!&#10;&#10;In more detail, each ship card has a hold number and possibly an icon. The cargo cards come in five types (cardamon, cloves, cinnamon, ginger, pepper), and they have a cost, an effect, an icon, and a money value. Grain cards have nothing but a picture of grain, yet they can be valuable, too. Each player starts with a hand of five cargo cards.&#10;&#10;On a turn, each player chooses a cargo card from their hand, then they reveal them simultaneously. If they can afford to pay the cost of their card, they do so, discarding cards from hand equal to the cost (with a card of the same color as the revealed cargo card counting for two cards) and handing those cards to their -left-hand neighbor. All cards are passed at the same time. If a player can't pay the cost of their card, they return it to hand, then give their left-hand neighbor one cargo card from the top of the deck.&#10;&#10;All players who paid the cost of their new cargo card now carry out the effect of that card. Ginger, for example, lets you draw grain cards equal to the number of ginger icons on your cargo cards and ship card; grain cards can't be placed on ships, but they can be used to pay for cargo. Cinnamon lets you take a coin and place it on your ship, then discard as many cards as you want to take additional coins; each coin helps to fill the hold of your ship.&#10;&#10;If the money value of a player's cargo cards (along with any coins they have) equal or exceed the hold value of a ship, that ship is full. The player places that ship aside, discards the cargo cards, then takes a new ship in a different color.&#10;&#10;Each player can discard any number of cards from their hand, then each person with fewer than six cards draws one cargo card from the deck. Cardamon icons can let you draw a card even if you have six or more cards, while cloves lets you draw additional cards anytime you draw cargo, then discard the same number of cards that you drew additionally. Filter cards to find what you want!&#10;&#10;",
