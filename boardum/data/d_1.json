    "description": "Created by Eleanor Abbott in the early 1940's to entertain children recovering from polio and first published by Milton Bradley (now Hasbro) in 1949, Candy Land encourages young players to socialize, exercise patience, recognize colors, learn rules, and follow directions.&#10;&#10;Players race down a rainbow-colored track to be the first to find the lost King Kandy at Candy Castle, but watch out for obstacles like the sticky Molasses Swamp!  Start by placing your plastic Gingerbread Man (or other character marker) at the beginning of the track.  Each turn, players draw a simple card and move by matching the color on the card to the next color on the track.  Some cards show a named location on the board; players who draw these cards move forward or backward on the track to the named location.  The game ends when the first player arrives at Candy Castle by reaching or moving beyond the last square on the track.&#10;&#10;In the 2004 version, younger players are not required to remove backward on the track if they draw a named card, and the last square of the track was changed from a Violet Square to a Rainbow Square, resolving a 55-year dispute over whether a player needs to land on the Violet Square or move beyond the Violet Square to win.&#10;&#10;Prior to the 2006 version, three colored spaces on the track (one in Molasses Swamp and two &quot;Cherry Pitfalls&quot;) were marked with a dot.  Players who landed on a dot were &quot;stuck,&quot; and were unable to move from the spot until they drew a card that matched the color of the square they were on.  The 2006 version replaced gum drops with licorice spaces; players who land on a licorice space only lose their next turn.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;The Legend of the Lost Candy Castle&rdquo; is printed inside the box and can be read out loud. The game parts can be stored below it. The game board is colorful and has lots of yummy candy references.&#10;&#10;",

Both players then turn their top card face up. The player with the higher value card takes both cards and puts them face down at the bottom of his or her pile. If the cards have equal value, there is a war. Both players place 3 cards face down (occasionally, some people play with the modified rules of 1 or 2 face-down cards instead of the standard three) on the table and then place another face-up card on top of those.  If the two are equal, they place more face-down cards and add another face-up card (etc.)  The winner of the round once the most recent face-up cards are different in value takes all of the cards currently on the table.  The game ends when one player has the entire deck.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Theme&#10;Players take the part of land owners, attempting to buy and then develop their land. Income is gained by other players visiting their properties and money is spent when they visit properties belonging to other players. When times get tough, players may have to mortgage their properties to raise cash for fines, taxes and other misfortunes.&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;On their turn, a player rolls two dice and moves that number of spaces around the board. If the player lands on an as-yet-unowned property, they has the opportunity to buy it or auction it to the highest bidder. If a player owns all the spaces within a color group, they may then build houses and hotels on these spaces, generating even more income from opponents who land there. If they lands on a property owned by another player, they must pay that player rent according to the value of the land and any buildings on it. There are other places on the board which can not be bought, but instead require the player to draw a card and perform the action on the card, pay taxes, collect income, or even go to jail.&#10;&#10;Goal&#10;The goal of the game is to be the last player remaining with any money. (though some editions end the game when the first player goes bankrupt)&#10;&#10;Cultural impact on rules&#10;Monopoly is unusual in that the game has official, printed rules, but most players learn how to play from others, never actually learning the correct way to play. This has led to the canonization of a number of house rules that make the game more palatable to children (and sore losers) but harm the gameplay by preventing players from going bankrupt or slowing down the rate of property acquisition. One common house rule has players put any money paid to the bank in the center of the board, which jackpot a player may earn by landing on Free Parking. This prevents the game from removing money from play, and since players collect $200 each time they pass Go, this results in ever-increasing bankrolls and players surviving rents that should have bankrupted them. Another house rule allows players to take &quot;loans&quot; from the bank instead of going bankrupt, which means the game will never end. Some house rules arise out of ignorance rather than attempts to improve the game. For instance, many players don't know that properties landed on but left unbought go up for auction, and even some that know to auction don't know that the bidding starts at $1, meaning a player may pay well below the listed price for an auctioned property.&#10;&#10;",

Each turn player rolls a die using the Pop-O-Matic and selects one of his pawns to move. Pawns can enter the track from Home base only on a roll of six. Each pawn needs to travel around the board and finish on the Finish lane. If pawn of another player is bumped, the bumped pawn is returned to home. The goal is to be the first one to get all the pawns to the Finish lane.&#10;&#10;For advanced players, we suggest that when a piece gets bumped, it should only be bumped back to its START space, rather than to its HOME.  Only when bumped from their START space are pieces sent HOME.&#10;&#10;Travel Trouble uses the same mechanisms, but is on a smaller board with fewer spaces, so it plays more quickly.&#10;&#10;",

There are a handful of choices regarding insurance and investments but for the most part it is a game of luck.&#10;&#10;Note -- this entry covers many versions of the game with different rule sets.  In general, the newer the printing the gentler the rules.  The 1960s original can be quite brutal if the players choose to act on all the options made available to them.

In this version, at the end of each turn, a new card is drawn from the deck to replace the card that was played, so that each player is always working from five cards.&#10;&#10;A player's fortunes can change dramatically in one or two rounds of play through the use of Sorry cards, the &quot;11&quot; cards (which give the player the option of trading places with an opponent's piece on the track), and the fact that it is possible to move from Start to Home without circumnavigating the full board by making judicious use of the &quot;backward 4&quot; cards.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Battleship was originally a pencil-and-paper public domain game known by different names, but Milton Bradley made it into the well known board game in 1967.  The pencil and paper grids were changed to plastic grids with holes that could hold plastic pegs used to record the guesses.&#10;&#10;Each player deploys his ships (of lengths varying from 2 to 5 squares) secretly on a square grid.  Then each player shoots at the other's grid by calling a location.  The defender responds by &quot;Hit!&quot; or &quot;Miss!&quot;.  You try to deduce where the enemy ships are and sink them.  First to do so wins.&#10;&#10;The Salvo variant listed in the rules allows each player to call out from 1 to 5 shots at a time depending on the amount of ships the player has left (IE: players each start off with 5 ships, so they start off with 5 shots.  As ships are sunk, the players gets fewer shots).  This version of the game is closer to the original pencil-and-paper public domain game.  Many versions of the pencil-and-paper game have different amounts of shots based on the ship (IE: Battleship: 5 shots. Destroyer: 3 Shots, Etc.).&#10;&#10;In 2008, Hasbro &quot;reinvented&quot; the game into Battleship (Revised).&#10;&#10;Some history of the published versions of the game:&#10;1931: Starex Novelty Co. of NY publishes Salvo.&#10;1933: The Strathmore Co. publishes Combat, The Battleship Game.&#10;1943: Milton Bradley publishes the pad-and-pencil game Broadsides, The Game of Naval Strategy.&#10;1943: Also published in 1943 Sink it by the L R Gebert Co. for distribution by G.

    "description": "The Game of Goose is an ancient children's classic, possibly tracing its roots all the way to the Ancient Egyptian game of Mehen which was played in early Old Kingdom times.&#10;&#10;Francesco de Medici in Italy sent a copy of this game to King Felipe II of Spain during the 16th century.&#10;It became one of the most popular games in Europe during that time.&#10;&#10;Circa 1600, Beno&icirc;t Rigaud's heirs printed in Lyon &quot;Le Jeu de l'oye, renouvell&eacute; des Grecs, jeu de grand plaisir, comme aujourd'huy princes &amp; grands seigneur&quot; [sic] &quot;le pratiquent&quot; - Le jeu de l'oie, renewed from the Greeks, game of great pleasure, as today princes and great lord [sic] play it -, the oldest French copy known.&#10;&#10;Father Claude-Fran&ccedil;ois Menestrier describes the game in his &quot;Biblioth&egrave;que curieuse et instructive&quot; (1704) : 'There's another type of game, that seems easier to learn, and easier to play; it's the game of goose so common and it is said to come from the Greeks, though nothing can be found about it in their authors. This game is much easier than cards game, because it's always wholly displayed to the players, and, being in the form of a snail or spirally folded snake, it's appropriate to print the things that one wants to learn...'.&#10;&#10;The game became an instant hit in France in the 1600s, and engendered a lot of variants (educational, commemorative, ...) up to the present day.&#10;&#10;It turned up later in England about 1750, according to Whitehouse, under the title &quot;Royall &amp; most pleasant game of the goose - Invented at the Consistory in Rome and are printed and sold by H. OVERTON at Ye White Horse without Newgate where all sorts of Fine Prints and maps are Sold and Framed at Reasonable Rate&quot;.&#10;&#10;By 1851 it had been copied by the American publisher J.P. Beach of New York who entitled it The Jolly Game of Goose. An 1855 edition was called simply The Game of Goose.&#10;&#10;It is a simple game of racing, using a spiral track with lovely illustrations. The main principle is one shared with Snakes and Ladders as well as the later Game of Life: virtue is rewarded and vice is punished.&#10;&#10;Schmidt Spiele rates their G&auml;nsespiel for ages 5 and up.&#10;&#10;Bibliography&#10;Whitehouse, F. R. B. (1971) [1951]. Table games of Georgian and Victorian days. Birmingham: Priory Press Ltd.&#10;'Jeux de princes, jeux de vilains', edited by Eve Netchine, Biblioth&egrave;que nationale de France / Seuil (2009).&#10;&#10;--gameplay description from Wikipedia:&#10;The board consists of a track with consecutively numbered spaces (usually 63), and is often arranged in a spiral with the starting point at the outside. Each player's piece is moved according to throws of one or two dice. Scattered throughout the board are a number of spaces on which a goose is depicted; landing on a goose allows the player to move again by the same distance. Additional shortcuts, such as spaces marked with a bridge, move the player to some other specified position. There are also a few penalty spaces which force the player to move backwards or lose one or more turns, the most recognizable being the one marked with a skull and symbolizing death; landing on this space results in the player being sent back to start. On Spanish boards the reverse is usually a Pachisi board.&#10;&#10;Many themed versions of the game have been created, depicting topics as diverse as ice skating, Richard Nixon, and sewage pumps. These can be valued for their historical or artistic merits even by those who have no interest in the game itself, with some editions having been sold for thousands of dollars at auction or displayed in museums.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Roulette is a French word meaning &quot;small wheel&quot;. It is the oldest casino game still in existence today. The exact origins of the game are unknown - there's probably been gambling using a wheel since the invention of the wheel. Some say it was invented in 1655 by the French scientist Blaise Pascal while working on a perpetual motion machine. Others say it derives from a Chinese game in which player try to move 36 statues into a magic circle. &#10; The Roulette layout that we know today first appeared in 1765 in Paris, but the modern version of the game did not appear until around 1842 when Frenchmen Francois and Louis Blanc are said to have invented the single &quot;0&quot; roulette game. Another mystic legend tells that Francois Blanc, who founded the first casinos in Monte Carlo, sold a soul to the devil for the secret of roulette. As proof, they point out that the sum of all the numbers on a Roulette wheel added together total 666 - the number of the beast.&#10; The single &quot;0&quot; wheel became known as the &quot;French Wheel&quot;. When French immigrants brought the game to America a double zero &quot;00&quot; was also added and this became known as the &quot;American Wheel&quot;. The game became popular in the old west of America during the California Gold Rush.&#10;&#10;Modern Roulette is a perfectly balanced wheel with a slot for each number. The numbers alternate between black and red (the 0 and 00 are green) and exactly opposite each other number is the corresponding higher and lower number (0 is opposite the 00, 1 is opposite the 2, and so on up to the 35 being directly opposite the 36). Players may place a multitude of wagers: Single Number pays 35:1, Two Numbers pays 17:1, Three numbers pays 11:1, Four Numbers pays 8:1, Five Numbers (American Wheel) pays 6:1, Six Numbers pays 5:1, Column or Dozen pays 2:1, High/Low Black/Red or Odd/Even pays 1:1. The 0 and 00 are not counted when calculating the odds which gives the house its edge. Ironically, no matter where you place your chips, the house edge remains almost constant (5.26% American Wheel, 2.70% French Wheel).&#10;&#10;When all the bets are placed the croupier rolls a little ivory ball along the inner edge of the wheel in the opposite direction of its spin. As the wheel turns, the ball loses momentum, bounces among the slots and finally falls into one of the numbered slots. The number that the ball rests on is the declared as the winning number for that game and winning wagers are paid off. &#10; ",

The Worst-Case Scenario Survival Game challenges players to use their survival instincts and skills to outlast their opponents. Each question has three possible answers: if you get it right you move ahead, if you get it wrong your opponent moves ahead, leaving you to face the peril at hand. The situations presented range from the hair-raising (how to cross a piranha-infested river) to the humorous (how to scratch an itch in a cast), providing fun on many levels == and you&rsquo;ll learn a lot of interesting information along the way. Great preparation for the great outdoors -- or a great party.&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;&#10;    Game board, &#10;    4 playing pieces&#10;    300 Worst-Case Scenario cards&#10;    1 die. &#10;&#10;&#10;For 2 or more players, teen-aged or adult.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "(Note: Not to be confused with Anti-Monopoly II. Please be careful when submitting new versions of this game; basically, anything published after 1987 will almost certainly be Anti-Monopoly II and belong to that game, even if it's called &quot;Anti-Monopoly&quot;. As for the reasons why this is so, please see the clarifications at the end of this article and the article of Anti-Monopoly II.)&#10;&#10;The &quot;Bust~the~Trust!&quot; Game&#10;&#10;The basic idea of the game is to end the monopolistic practices of the 3-company-combinations of the game board. The players are Trust-Busting lawyers going about the board slapping lawsuits on the monopolies. The winning trust buster is the one who ends with the largest number of social-credit points when one of the players runs out of money.&#10;&#10;There are 3 kinds of company combinations on the board: Oligopolies, Trusts and Monopolies, marked by one, two and three &quot;accusation circles&quot; respectively. &quot;Accusing&quot; is done by placing a small, round chip of the same color as your token on such a circle. When all accusation circles of a combination are covered, the monopolistic practices of that combination have been ended. An accusation chip can be bought from the &quot;Budget-Commissioner&quot;; when lending money, he provides a Social-Credit card as an IOU.&#10;&#10;Variant rules are supplied for a Low-Budget Game and a Trading Game.&#10;&#10;Anspach fought --and won-- a vicious court battle against Hasbro (and others) over this game.&#10;&#10;Anti-Monopoly was briefly (1976-1982) published as &quot;Anti&quot; and &quot;Anti-Monopoly II&quot; was published as &quot;Choice&quot; whilst the company was forbidden to use the word &quot;Monopoly&quot;. In 1984 after prevailing in court the company used the names &quot;Anti-Monopoly&quot; and &quot;Anti-Monopoly II&quot; for its two games.  In 1987, Anti-Monopoly was withdrawn and Anti-Monopoly II was renamed &quot;Anti-Monopoly&quot;.  The game described here was produced as Anti-Monopoly before 1976 and from 1984 thru 1987.  The game produced as Anti-Monopoly after 1987 is a different game, with the same name. Plenty of potential for confusion there, eh?&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Top Trumps has been a popular card game in the United Kingdom since the seventies. There are many different card decks based on different subjects, e.g cars, planes, films, military jets, or TV shows. The decks are also available in the USA. Each pack of Top Trumps consists of a number of cards (usually 30 or 32), each of which features an item or character related to the subject of the deck; each card has a picture, some numerical statistics, and possibly some additional text. The pack is the size of an ordinary pack of cards so is readily portable.&#10;&#10;Deal out all the cards face down to the players. Each player holds their cards face up but may only look at their top card. The player to go first chooses the a statistic (usually a high one) from their top card, e.g. &quot;Top Speed 252mph&quot;. All other players read out the same statistic. Whoever has the best or highest value wins and places all the top cards including their own to the bottom of their pile. They then choose the statistic for the next round.&#10;&#10;During a round, if 2 or more cards tie or no data is available for that particular statistic then all the cards are placed to one side and the same player chooses again from their next card. The winner of the hand also takes the cards that were placed to one side. The first player to win all the cards is the winner of the game.&#10;&#10;Familiarity with the deck is useful since the player will know which statistics are high (and, particularly, which cards have the absolute highest value for a given statistic).&#10;&#10;This game is sometimes paired in the same deck with The Game of Authors a.k.a. Quartets.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "BlackJack originated in French casinos around 1700 where it was called &quot;vingt-et-un&quot; and has been played in the U.S. since the 1800's.&#10;&#10;Blackjack is played with a standard deck of 52 playing cards. In a Casino, usually six (6) or eight (8) decks of cards are shuffled together and placed in a card shoe for distribution.  The player must wager before any cards are dealt. He does this by placing his bet in front of his table position. Next, the dealer deals two cards to each of the players and two to himself. (One of the dealer's cards is dealt face up, one is dealt face down). Face cards count as ten, ace counts as one or 11, and all other cards are counted at their face value.&#10;&#10;A blackjack occurs if the player's first two cards are an ace and a ten or face card. This is usually a winning hand, although if the dealer also has a blackjack, it is a tie. A winning blackjack pays the player three to two.&#10;&#10;The dealer must draw on 16 and stand on 17. (A dealer total of 17 including an ace, or &quot;soft 17&quot;, must be drawn to in some games and must stand in others). Options:&#10;&#10;Hit or Stand - Hit means to draw another card, which the player signifies by tapping the table with his cards or a similar hand motion. Stand means that the player wants no more cards, which the player signals by placing his cards under his wager or holding his hand in a horizontal direction. If the player hits and busts (goes over 21), his wager is lost.&#10;&#10;Double down - The player is allowed to double his original bet on his first two cards, then draw one more card.&#10;&#10;Splitting - If the first cards a player is dealt are a pair, they may be split into two hands which are played separately. The bet on each hand must be the same amount. Aces receive only one card. After splitting, Ace-ten counts as 21, and not as blackjack.&#10;&#10;Insurance - A bet not exceeding one-half of the original bet. When the dealer's up card is an ace, the player may take insurance. If the dealer's down card is a ten or face card, the player wins two to one. Any other card means a win for the dealer.&#10;&#10;Surrender - To give up after the deal of the first two cards. Only one-half of the original bet is lost. Not all blackjack games offer surrender.&#10;&#10;When not playing at a casino, it is usual for the role of Dealer to rotate among the players.&#10;&#10;Pontoon is a similar game, but there are some small rules variations. For example, the dealer wins on ties and both of their cards are dealt face down.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Tiddledy Winks varies based on publisher, but they all generally have a cup or other container that sits in the center of a target.  The object of the game is to flip small smooth disks (the &quot;winks&quot;) into the cup.  This is accomplished by placing a wink on a piece of felt and then pressing down on the edge of the wink with a larger disk (the &quot;tiddledy&quot;) so that the wink pops up into the air, and hopefully lands in the cup.  The highest points are awarded for winks that land in the cup, with winks landing in the target area scoring less.  Players decide ahead of time to play a set number of rounds (in which case the winner is the person with the highest score at the end of the last round), or to play until someone reaches a certain score (in which case the winner is the first person to reach or exceed that score).&#10;&#10;Wikipedia notes that Joseph Assheton Fincher filed the original patent application for the game in 1888, applied for the trademark Tiddledy-Winks in 1889, and licensed John Jaques and Son as the exclusive distributors of the game. However, the intense popularity of the game prompted other publishers to churn out cheaper competitors under names like Spoof, Flipperty Flop, Jumpkins, Golfette, Maro, Flutter. As early as 1890, Jacques boxes included a label warning of &quot;worthless imitations... issued by unscrupulous and jealous persons&quot;, and its rules threatened that &quot;proceedings will be taken against any one infringing the Proprietors' Rights in this Game&quot;.&#10;&#10;",

Designed in 1949 by then 19-year-old Kari Mannerla and published two years later in 1951, it has sold over 3.5 million copies since, half of them in Finland. There's one in almost every home in Finland.&#10;&#10;Players start in either Cairo or Tangier and start exploring Africa, trying to find gems. The main objective is to find the legendary giant diamond, Star of Africa. However, when flipping the tokens, players cannot know what they will find: nothing at all, some lesser gemstones or even a robber stealing their money and slowing their progress.&#10;&#10;When someone finds the Star of Africa, a race begins. The player with the diamond tries to deliver it back to Cairo or Tangier, other players try to find a horseshoe - a token discarded with no value before, now a key to victory. Winner is the player who reaches Cairo or Tangier first, carrying either the diamond or a horseshoe.&#10;&#10;A rules amendment, which prevents a player being stuck on an island and effectively out of the game, was only added in 2005.&#10;&#10;The first official expansion, Afrikan t&#195;&#164;hti: Retkikunnat, was published in 2014. This could be a record - a game being expanded for the first time, by the rights holder, 63 years after it was first published.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by: Inkan Aarre&#10;&#10;",

If the player guesses the majority preference, he gets to move otherwise he must pass. Some spaces allow the player to invent their own awful hypothetical choice. The other players vote secretly on their choice in this case. If the vote is not unamimous, the player can move or send someone else back. Players roll a six-sided die and there are only 10 spaces to the goal so games go very quickly. Typical choices on the cards include, &quot;Would you rather lie naked in a bathtub full of live roaches or dive head first into a pool of tobacco spit?&quot; The answer &quot;neither&quot; is NEVER allowed.&#10;&#10;Variant:&#10;The 2003 version of this game &quot;Would You Rather?&quot; appears to have quite different rules to the above described game. There is a new simpler square board with more spaces. Unlike the 20 minutes of the above game, 1-2 hours is recommended by the manufacturer. Players roll a dice, then move and depending where they land, draw cards with dilemmas to pose to the rest of the other players. The current player must try to secretly predict the result of the other players' subsequent open discussion and consensus view. No-one is penalised for an inability to reach consensus, the game encourages one option picked at random perhaps by flipping a coin, to keep the game moving. If the current player predicted correctly, they get a bonus turn.&#10;&#10;Typical questions include &quot;Would you rather ... On senior prom night, have to take your parent -OR- your 12 year old sibling?&quot;&#10;&#10;Every so often players get the opportunity to take a difficult challenge with the winner being the first person to complete their third challenge.&#10;&#10;",

In the first part, players circle the board, feeding money into the eight available properties, then bidding on those properties (not being able to see how much the property is worth) and collecting &quot;Trump&quot; cards.  When all the properties are gone, the negotiation phase begins.  Players use their Trump cards to buy and sell properties, some cards award huge payoffs for specific sets.  After each player has passed their turn, the property values are revealed, and the player with the most money wins (usually in the $400-$600M range).&#10;&#10;",

You can play one match for each card in the center row.  You can also combine two cards from your hand that add up to the number you wish to match.  If the card(s) you played match both number and color, you earn the right to place extra cards from your hand in the center row and even force other players to draw cards.  Don't forget to yell &quot;Dos!&quot; whenever you have two cards in your hand or you could end up drawing more cards!&#10;&#10;The round ends when one player gets rid of all his cards. That player earns points based on the values of the cards left in the other players' hands. Continue playing in rounds until someone reaches 200 points. That player is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

Even the youngest of children can join in the fun and even play by themselves.&#10;&#10;Number of players: Two to eight, each for himself.&#10;The Deck: Standard 52 card pack.&#10;&#10;The Deal: Any player is able to deal first. Just shuffle and deal out cards, one at a time to each player in rotation until all have been used. The cards need not come out even. Each player squares up his hand into a neat pile in front of him without looking at the cards which are face down.&#10;&#10;Object of the game: To win all the cards by being the first to slap each jack as it is played to the center.&#10;&#10;The play. Each player in turn, starting from the dealer's left, is required to lift one card from the pile in front of him and place it face up in the center of the table. The players must turn up the card away from him and not toward him; he must not see it earlier than any other player. At the same time, the play should be made with a swift movement so the other players may not see the denomination of the card before he does.&#10;&#10;If the card played to the center is a jack, the first player must slap his hand down on it, take it, and with it, all cards below it in the center of the table. The player who wins these cards must turn them face down and shuffle them with the cards in his hand still remaining on the table in front of him, in order to form a new hand.&#10;Suppose more than one player slaps at a jack. The one whose hand is lowest (directly on top of the jack) is declared winner of the pile. If a player has no more cards left, he remains in the game until a jack is next turned, and he may then slap at the jack in an effort to get a new hand. Should he fail to win, the player is declared out of the game. The play continues until one player possesses all the cards. That player is then made the winner! NOTE: If a dealer's card is exposed, then all the cards must be shuffled before they are again placed face down. If a player slaps at any card in the center other than a Jack, he is required to give one card, face down, to the player of that card.&#10;&#10;",

When a player stops on a color they get a question of the appropriate category. If the player answers a question correctly while on a pie space, they get a pie of that color (assuming they don't already have it). A correct answer on another square allows the player to roll again.&#10;&#10;Once the player has one pie in each color, she can move along the spokes to the middle of the board to win the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Published in 1905 by Milton Bradley (catalog #4384).  Game is played with a deck of 40 color lithographed cards depicting various comical scenes.  The object of the game is to &quot;capture&quot; all of the cards, this is done in the following manner.&#10;&#10;1. Deal the cards equally among the different players, keeping them face down.&#10;&#10;2. The player at the left of the dealer begins the game by taking off the first card of his pack, and placing it on the table face up, and the play continues to the left until each player in turn turns up the first card of his pack in the same manner.&#10;&#10;3. When any player sees two cards which are alike turned up on the table, he may call out &quot;SNAP&quot;, and the one first calling takes all the turned up cards in both places where the duplicate cards appear.&#10;&#10;4. The successful player takes all cards won and places them face downwards under his original pack and must then play his first card upon the table.&#10;&#10;5. The game continues as above until one player secures the entire pack, thereby winning the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Players move around a map of Europe, scoring points for each destination they reach. Card play determines destination, transportation method, and distance traveled. Players may play hazard cards to block or slow down their opponents. One of the players is the assassin and scores bonus points by getting a &quot;hit&quot; on one of the other players. Game length is variable: when a weapon card is drawn by a player, it is placed on the map. When the fourth weapon card is drawn, the game ends.&#10;&#10;The game is a revised version of EuroHit.&#10;&#10;[Below descriptive text from the box back]&#10;&#10;Assassination has been the tool of the desperate and the ruthless seeking change since time immemorial.  The course of mankind's bloody history has taken many a turn due to the assassin's bullet.  Any successful leader--whether criminal, business scientific religious or political--can suddenly become a target in these modern days.  The assassin strikes without warning, at the least expected time from the last expected quarter.  Be he professional or amateur, the assassin's primary weapon is his ability to blend with his background, to be &quot;one of the crowd&quot;.  It is his skill at doing so that enables him, like the hunter in the wild, to surprise and kill his quarry.  Unbeknownst to you, the world's greatest assassin could be your brother or sister, your spouse, your child or parent, or your friend seated beside you.  Perhaps you yourself are the next &quot;Jackal&quot;.&#10;&#10;Avalon Hill's ASSASSIN is a challenging card/board game for 3-6 players, aged ten and up.  Played against the backdrop of modern Europe, players travel about the board, scoring points for visiting as many cities as possible.  But beware, for some unknown reason one among the players is an &quot;Assassin&quot;, who scores even more points by making a &quot;Hit&quot; when in the same city as another.  Perhaps the intercession of an &quot;Interpol Officer&quot; might save you; perhaps not.  Perhaps an &quot;Espionage Agent&quot; will alert you to who among the players is the threat; perhaps not.  Perhaps the assassin will hit an &quot;Innocent Bystander&quot; instead of you' perhaps not.  And the players never know when the turn of the next card in the deck will bring the game to an end.  Like our fast-paced world, the action in ASSASSIN is furious and challenging, with just a hint of uncertainty and danger to add spice to the intoxicating mix.&#10;&#10;Blessed with colorful and eye-catching artwork, Avalon Hill's ASSASSIN is both educational and entertaining.  Playable in under 90 minutes, it is the perfect game for social gatherings.  The rules are easily mastered, and included numerous options to make the strategy more or less challenging, and playing time shorter or longer.  The play can e lighthearted and friendly, or ruthlessly competitive, the rules allow for either, depending upon the style of play and the desires of your group.  So, if you are ready to face the challenge of touring Europe while a killer stalks your heels, shuffle the cards and sit down to play ASSASSIN.&#10;&#10;A fast-moving fun game for 3 to 6 friends to play in an evening!&#10;&#10;",

Eventually, the pot will tip over and spill the beans.  Whoever causes this adds the beans to his store.  The object is to go out.&#10;&#10;Simple, quick, fun little game, requiring a minimum of dexterity.&#10;&#10;Schaper was bought out by Milton Bradley in 1986 (or MB acquired the rights to most of Schaper's games, I'm not sure), and this game has been published by MB ever since.&#10;&#10;",

Cards also feature numbers and symbols, so children who cannot read will still be able to play.&#10;&#10;Be the first to arrive at Dr. Possum's house to win the game!&#10;&#10;The American writer Howard R. Garis (1872-1961) created the character &quot;Uncle Wiggily Longears&quot; for a children's book in 1910. According to Whitehill, the game based on the children's story was first introduced by the Milton Bradley Company in 1916. Bradley modified the game in 1923, 1949, and 1955. Whitehill states that Parker Brothers obtained the rights to Uncle Wiggily in 1967. However, in 1989 both Milton Bradley Co. and Parker Brothers reintroduced different version of the same game. Hasbro now owns both the Parker and Bradley rights, but apparently is producing the Bradley version for the current market. The game is of the &quot;racing&quot; variety in the style of the European &quot;Goose Game&quot;, that is the first player to reach the end of the &quot;track&quot; wins.&#10;&#10;",

The term Pog comes from POG brand juice.&#10;&#10;Each player begins with their collection of Pogs (milk caps) and at least one slammer (a heavier playing piece).  Players add an equal number (often just one) of Pogs to a face down stack and take turns attempted to overturn the Pogs by throwing their slammer at it.  Pogs which are turned face up are collected by the thrower.  The game continues in this manner until players run out of Pogs to add to the stack or until they voluntarily quit.&#10;&#10;",

The Speak Out game brings friends and family together for laugh-out-loud fun as players try to say different phrases while wearing a mouthpiece that won't let them shut their mouth. In the Speak Out game, players draw from the deck and read the phrase as best as they can, but it's not so easy to do when the mouthpiece is hindering them from forming words correctly. The timer counts down as players try to say phrases such as &quot;he's my stealthy pet ferret name Garrett&quot;, &quot;slow down, you careless clown&quot;, or &quot;pelicans love pollywog falafels.&quot; The laughter continues as players try to decipher what in the world their teammate is trying to say, and must correctly guess the phrase in order to earn the card. The team with the most cards at the end of the game wins. The Speak Out game includes 200 double-sided cards, 5 mouthpieces, and a timer.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
