These characters are then sent on heists to try and overcome defense cards in front of objectives, using their different sets of skills to bypass guards, traps and walls to get to the filthy lucre that they're after. Players not involved in the heist will, of course, try and stop the thieves in their tracks by playing Scheme cards, which represent the quirks of fate which might cause a heist to fail--unexpectedly alert guards, City Watch patrols, or the simple mistake that leads to disaster.&#10;&#10;Staging a heist alone is difficult, but working together with other players leaves you open to betrayal by your so-called allies, or gives you the chance to betray them, and take it all for yourself. Once any player has been betrayed, the game changes, and more dangerous abilities on different cards can now be played. The Assassin begins killing other characters, the Pickpocket starts stealing from players, the Fall Guy takes the blame, and the whole table becomes a little more vicious. Thieves like to believe they have a code of honor, but once that illusion is broken, there is no going back.&#10;&#10;What will you risk to be the richest and cleverest thief in this city of rogues?&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "A century ago, the true measure of wits was determined by feats of engineering. In &ldquo;Bridges to Nowhere&rdquo;, you are attempting to outwit your opponent and construct the most magnificent bridge. Will you plan for a sturdy long bridge, or maybe take a risk with a shorter multilevel bridge where your points can soar as you reach for great heights? Whatever you do, don't forget to keep an eye on your opponent or you may just hand them the victory.&#10;&#10;Bridges to Nowhere is a 10-minute, 2-player micro game of strategic card drafting and bridge building. In 4 quick rounds, Players take turns drafting &quot;bridge cards&quot; which they will use to attach to larger &quot;pillar cards&quot; creating a unique Bridge tableau in front of them. At the end of 4 rounds, the Player whose bridge scores them the most points wins!&#10;&#10;No one ever said building a bridge was easy though! The challenge and fun of Bridges to Nowhere is found in trying to plan and build within the very particular guidelines of the game. There are three different types of bridge cards (Truss/Cable/Suspension) and they may never be mixed together in the same bridge. Not only that, each bridge card has a numeric point value listed at the bottom along with two symbols, one on each side. Two cards with the same bridge number can never be placed side by side, AND a single line of adjacent bridge cards can only ascend and/or descend numerically once in a single bridge segment.&#10;&#10;The Pillar cards are what you'll need to frame your bridge segments and possibly lay a foundation for a double or even TRIPLE decker bridge(if you've got the nerve). Be careful though, your Pillar cards are a strategic resource. If you don't play them just right you may end up with only a partially finished bridge, and that will cost you!&#10;&#10;Oh, but don't forget those symbols! If you can match two of the same symbols side by side in a bridge segment you'll reap big point bonuses. Another way to gain bonuses in the game is by completing Contract cards. These give both players a very specific set of bridge construction goals to try and reach in order to gain a medium or large point boost to their total score.&#10;&#10;",

Unlike games that tend to aim for a perfect balance, FreakFace&rsquo;s main focus is delivering the terrifying experience that occurred on this Halloween night.  Characters and situations are not balanced to equal one another but created to simulate the actual experience as it happened.  The game begins slanted to the diabolic character, they will certainly destroy if fighting just ill prepared kids.  Through the use of finding items, hiding or alerting possible neutral characters, the kids can possibly turn the tables on the diabolic plot.  But there may also be a horrible realization that certain neutral characters are sinister themselves. The kids may not be able to trust anyone!  It might be best to just escape!  ESCAPE FROM THIS FREAKSHOW OF HORROR!&#10;&#10;Freakface!!! is a tactical hex and counter game with each token representing an individual character. Characters have sheets with some individual stats related to speed, strength and will to live. The Teen can win if any of them escape the North, West, or East side of the map while hidden, or by killing the Carny.&#10;&#10;Freakface!!! is a very visceral experience and we have rated it X.

Four blue and three green scoring spaces are scattered on the track, and four summit spaces are found at the end of the track. Each player is dealt a hand of six cards, with cards coming in ten colors to match those of the dragons; each player also starts with a uniquely-colored card face-up on the table to indicate which dragon the player is riding.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player lays down one card from his hand, then advances the appropriately-colored dragon as many spaces as the number shown on the card. If another player has a card of this color in front of her, the player places the card on that player's stack; if not, the player places the card on his own stack, effectively changing steeds if the color differs from what was on top previously. (Exception: If a dragon not being ridden by anyone is in last place, the player may choose to place the card under his stack instead of on top of it, while moving the dragon normally.)&#10;&#10;If a dragon moves onto a blue space, then each dragon on a space valued three or less scores that many points for the player riding that dragon, if any. If a dragon moves onto a green space, then each player scores points equal to the value of the space on which his dragon stands. If a player causes no scoring on his turn or plays his last card in hand, he refills his hand to six cards; if he caused a scoring, then he draws no card and plays with a smaller hand next turn.&#10;&#10;When a dragon moves onto one of the four summit spaces, all dragons score points (possibly negative) for their riders. Once three dragons have reached the summit, the game ends after a final scoring, and whoever has scored the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "The war in China-India-Burma theatre is always looked at as through a veil; perceived as a backwater front of the far larger conflict that was World War Two. Nevertheless, this war was vital to the final Allied victory in the Pacific, and even more so to the impact this war would have on the post-war world. Many &ldquo;what-ifs&rdquo; could have dramatically changed the world. What if China had surrendered in 1937 and over a million Japanese soldiers would be free to overrun India. There would be no Flying Tigers or Doolittle's Raid, or even Pearl Harbor. If Japan could have mobilized Chinese manpower, the world as we know it might not exist.&#10;&#10;War of the Suns (WotS) was first designed by Leonard To, a Hong Kong native, more than 20 years ago. It won the championship of the First Wargame Design Competition in Hong Kong in 1984. The game has since been updated in the early 90's, and extensively again during the last 3 years. Offering exclusive research based on recently opened Chinese archives, as well as many Japanese and English sources, has made War of the Suns one of the most painstakingly researched and accurate games of its type ever made.&#10;&#10;The title of the &mdash; &quot;War of the Suns&quot;, refers to the flags of Kuomintang China and Imperial Japan. The game itself covers the period from July 1937 to August 1945. The roughly 1:3,000,000 map covers most of China proper, Burma, Assam area of India, and parts of Thailand and Indochina.&#10;&#10;There is a campaign game as well as 5 separate scenarios, and the game can be played as a 1-4 players' game-with players taking the roles of Japanese, KMT, CCP, and British Commonwealth. In the game, politics will play as vital a role in how the game progresses as the units presented on the map.&#10;&#10;Other key game concepts include: &#10;&#10;    The HQ activation system - Players move units under the activated HQ. The number of activated HQs is affected by command points, the quality of HQ selected, and whether China is cut off from foreign routes. Randomness and quality of the HQ affects who moves what first.&#10;    The KMT replacement system - KMT units are divided into 3 levels: The elite units with imported weapons; the standard units equipped with what Chinese herself produced; and the local units which simply bought whatever they could find locally.&#10;    The Political Affiliation system - Each warlord and minor country has its own home territory.

You only have a certain number of rounds, so plan carefully every move. You only win when you build all the buildings.&#10;&#10;You will play one card in each round. You can use it as a material or perform the action described on it. You can also strengthen your action by activating one of the 2 dice you will have. However, beware, every time you play the card you will cause the passage of time and you will forced to move your pawn to next district in the city! You will be able to take advantage of the action given by each district, but keep in mind that you will not be able to use the same region in subsequent rounds. Therefore, plan your moves in advance. Will you use the die to strengthen the action on the card? Or maybe you will use them to get more materials? Or maybe it is worth giving up one and the other to unlock previously used districts? One thing is certain, you will not complain about the lack of hard decisions!&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Introduction:&#10;&#10;Drang Nach Osten! is a historical wargame/simulation of the German invasion of the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941 that lead to the gates of Moscow and ultimately to the destruction of the Wehrmacht and the fall of the Third Reich. Drang Nach Osten! is a complete wargame of the largest invasion in history, but may be incorporated into the larger series of game/simulations collectively titled Europa. Drang Nach Osten! carries the Russian Campaign from June 1941 to the end of the Soviet winter counteroffensive in March 1942.  Unentschieden (Europa II) continues the campaign through 1944-45. The two games together comprise the entire war in the East, 1941-45.&#10;&#10;Game Components:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Five 21 x 27&quot; mapsheets (numbered Europa 1 through 5).&#10;    One set of eight unit countersheets (for a total of 1792 counters) consisting of:&#10;    Two Europa sheet 1&#10;    One Europa sheet 2&#10;    Three Europa sheet 3&#10;    One Europa sheet 4&#10;    One Europa sheet 5 (half-sheet)&#10;    One rules folder and cover.&#10;    One set of charts and tables consisting of:&#10;        One Soviet Initial Order of Battle&#10;        One Soviet Order of Appearance&#10;        One Soviet Units Appearing Chart&#10;        One German Initial Order of Battle&#10;        One German Order of Appearance&#10;        One German Units Appearing Chart&#10;        Two Combat Results Tables&#10;        One Unit Identification Chart&#10;        One Time Record Chart&#10;        One Terrain Effects on Combat Chart&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;Notes:&#10;&#10;Each hex is 16 miles, each turn is two weeks. Ground units are Army HQs, Divisions (and Soviet Tank Corps), Brigades/Regiments, and Battalions. Air units are groups of 40-60 aircraft. There is a fair amount of unit specialisation, although at 20 pages the rules are far less intimidating by today's standards than when they first appeared over thirty years ago. Drang Nach Osten! lasts for 19 half-monthly game turns (Jun II 41 through Mar II 42), so allowing for the initial set up 20 sessions of several hours is a realistic playing time.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "World War II is ongoing. Germany broadly uses Enigma rotor cipher machines. The breaking of the Enigma code gives the Allies an advantage in the war &mdash; but this is just one side of the coin because the Enigma code is based on chaos, a non-measurable force lurking beyond the boundaries of our world and eager to consume all its flesh. The code decryption would stop the chaos invasion into our world.&#10;&#10;An &quot;Agency&quot; operates in a secret heavily-guarded Victorian mansion somewhere in London suburbs; it has been opposing the supernatural for centuries. To break the Enigma code, the Agency has gathered the world's best decrypters together. You are one of them. Your mission is to break the Enigma code as soon as possible while wandering inside the mansion with an ever-changing layout. At least, you tell others so. In fact, you might pursue completely different goals...&#10;&#10;Enigma: Beyond Code is a game of deduction. Victory depends on your ability to understand the motives of other players and locate the cards you need &mdash; while keeping others away from the cards they are looking for. Each play takes 5-10 minutes, and it is best to play Enigma: Beyond Code up to three victories.&#10;&#10;In the beginning, each player receives a character card featuring a cryptology expert who has arrived at the Agency's mansion to break the Enigma code. But only one of them is the true decrypter; the others are just masterfully posing as cryptologists. Each of them has a unique secret mission. To accomplish the missions of their characters, the players view mansion cards in turns; each of these cards represents a room or an object inside the mansion. The invited experts work as a team, which means that upon looking at a mansion card, you must tell others what is there. You may either lie or tell the truth &mdash; that depends on your goals. Lying is always a risk, while telling the truth may allow your opponents to win.&#10;&#10;The player who first accomplishes their character's mission wins the game. If no one does so within the game's time limit, chaos breaks into our world, and all players lose!&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Description from BoardgameNews.com:&#10;&#10;The Ragnar Brothers return to canal-building in this new game set during the Industrial Revolution, which will be produced in an edition of 1,000 copies. Here's a game description from the back of the box:&#10;&#10;&quot;For a brief period the Industrial Revolution burned so bright that Britain was known as the 'Workshop of the World.' This Ragnar Brothers' game recreates that dramatic time. Players establish their position on the map-board by investing in ports, heavy industries, textiles, light industries and crafts. Canal networks are built to connect the thriving towns. Expenditure is vast, but capital gains are greater. Next the railways are built and each player seeks to strengthen their industrial base. By game end, towns are linked from London to Wales, Scotland to the Channel ports. Wealth decides the winner.&quot;&#10;&#10;And here's the game play described in more detail:&#10;&#10;&bull; The game lasts two eras &ndash; the Canal Era and Railroad Era &ndash; with players earning money at the end of each era.&#10;&#10;&bull; Before starting an era, players each reveal one of their two demand tokens to show which towns (ports, textile locations, etc.) have special value.&#10;&#10;&bull; Each era lasts a number of rounds, and in each round players reveal town cards equal to the number of players, then hold an auction for turn order. Players choose towns in turn order, placing an Industry marker on that location, then optionally building links from that town, ideally forming a network of links that connects their Industries.&#10;&#10;&bull; Once the town cards run out, the era ends. Players (may) reveal their second demand token, then they collect money equal to their revenue (earned by connecting Industries with links), the demand value of their Industries, and the value of their largest network of links, with token payment for any remaining links.&#10;&#10;&bull; Between eras, the game is reset Amun-Re-style, with revenues being zeroed out and all links being cleared from the board. Players' Industries remain in place, letting them build on their holdings in the second era, which otherwise plays out nearly identical to the first.&#10;&#10;",

If you use clever tactics, you might even finish off an entire row in one go! Which will win in the end: fire or water?&#10;&#10;The 6x6 game board starts with eight tiles of each player &ndash; one being fire, the other water &ndash; in a fixed arrangement. Twelve air tiles and nine earth tiles start play off the board; all of the non-earth tiles have earth on their reverse side. On a turn, a player takes a neutral tile from off the board and slides it onto an edge space, which means at the start of the game the 6x6 border. If this edge space is occupied, the neutral tile pushes those tiles before it. If a non-earth tile is pushed off the edge of the board, flip it to the earth side. Earth tiles can be moved, but they cannot be pushed off the board!&#10;&#10;If an outer edge of the playing area ever contains only tiles of the same element, remove these tiles from the board. These spaces are now off-limits on future turns. Thus, when the first edge is removed, pretend that the playing area is 5x6; when the second edge is removed, the playing area will be 4x6 or 5x5. Removing one row of tiles might cause another row to be removed afterward.&#10;&#10;As soon as either fire or water are eliminated from the playing area, the opposing player wins.&#10;&#10;",

In this game you will take the role of a novice adventurer who will try, as they progress through epic adventures, to defeat the Great Dragon and take its mythical treasure with them. Of course, it won't be easy: both the enemies you meet and your own rivals will try to prevent you from doing so. Because there can only be one winner here... although you may all lose!&#10;&#10;Cartaventuras is a narrative card game in which each game will write the story of your glory, or the Dragon's supper if you don't beat it. The same Dragon that terrorizes the Kingdom, yes, that one, the one with the priceless treasure.&#10;&#10;Your starting equipment is like you: it has potential but is more pitiful than scary, so before you face the Dragon, you'd better go on some adventures first. You know other adventurers have found riches by defeating enemies, acquiring weapons and finding items or fragments of powerful relics that can forged. Sounds good, doesn't it? The problem is that those enemies won't want to give away their possessions voluntarily.&#10;&#10;Each play is basically a tour across the Kingdom, with the map (the board, actually) being shaped randomly card by card. Each card includes a text and a picture describing an event; the development of the game will determine the narration of your hero's adventures.&#10;&#10;When you're ready for the challenge, properly equipped and in the right mood, it'll be time to face the biggest and most dangerous monster in the kingdom: The Great Dragon, with capital letters, sharp teeth, impenetrable scales... and an eager desire to eat.&#10;&#10;Manage your items cleverly, trade skilfully, plan your way well and go for it!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;En Cartaventuras se unen la fantas&iacute;a, el humor y la narraci&oacute;n.

    "description": "OVERVIEW&#10;Sans Alli&eacute;s (French: &ldquo;without allies&rdquo;) is a solitaire card game where you command 20th century troops and technology, pushing through an enemy nation bent on developing a vile super-weapon.  Sans Alli&eacute;s takes the feel of a grand-strategy, area-movement war game and compresses it into a tight little solo package, playable in about an hour.&#10;&#10;GAME PLAY&#10;The enemy nation is represented by an assortment of &quot;region&quot; cards arranged as a layered pyramid, with the &quot;enemy capital&quot; card at the top of the pyramid.  Meanwhile, the enemy's &quot;progress&quot; towards completion of an ultimate weapon is represented by a proximity track along the side of the pyramid, which possibly increases each turn.  The object of the game is to capture or claim the enemy capital card before the enemy succeeds in completing his weapon.&#10;&#10;No region card can be removed from the pyramid until either one or both of the cards laid atop it are removed first.  Therefore, you will need to capture region cards at the lowest level of the pyramid first, working your way up the pyramid in stages.  Each attempt to capture a region is called an &quot;invasion.&quot; To conduct invasions, you gather various military unit cards from your draw deck (separate from the enemy nation deck).  These units have strength values, while each level of the pyramid has a defensive value.  You have to amass enough strength and the right types of units to attempt an invasion on a given region, and then a roll of the dice determines whether you lose (discard) this entire invasionary force, or save a few, or lose more than expected, and are possibly forced to retreat.&#10;&#10;Along the way, you can capture select region cards called resource centers, and/or you can invade select zones to liberate prison camps.  These achievements not only increase the number of cards you draw on a turn, but also grant you the ability to improve your units strength values, and they introduce tactical developments that give you more dynamic choices in battle, including an Ultimate Weapon of your own.&#10;&#10;",

In combat, each player plays two cards from his hand, with cards coming from a standard 52-card deck. Different units have different powers; the elephant, for example, doubles a player's highest card while the cavalry doubles his lowest one. Certain combinations of cards allow for special actions, such as seeing what your opponent plays before laying down your own cards.&#10;&#10;",

It&rsquo;s going to stay standing, at least for now. Although most of you are working as a team, one player is a Traitor trying to make the tower fall.&#10;&#10;In Crazy Tower, players work together to get rid of their blocks and build a safe, stable structure. All of them, except for one that is. One player takes on the role of the Traitor, looking to deviously make a building that will collapse on another player&rsquo;s turn. Will they succeed, or will the Tower stand the test of time? Either way, you can bet it&rsquo;s going to be crazy!&#10;&#10;On a turn, players can either place a block on the highest floor of the tower or place a new Floor and then add a block to that floor. A block may only ever be added to the highest Floor and must be laid following the instructions on the Floor. If the team successfully places their final piece on the Tower, they win the game, but if it falls and it&rsquo;s not on the Saboteur&rsquo;s turn, then they win.&#10;&#10;",

The theme this time is the &quot;mycel heathen here&quot;: the terrifying host of Vikings that landed in England not to loot and pillage, but to conquer. They were steadfastly resisted by Alfred the Great, King of Wessex, and three of Alfie's most famous battles are included. His descendents fought off Viking encroachments with varying degrees of success, until the victory of Canute in 1016. The battles are as follows:&#10;&#10;Ashdown 871 - King Aethelred and his kid brother Alfred each command half of the army on either side of a causeway, squaring off against a Viking army likewise split in two. Basically two small battles fought side-by-side.&#10;&#10;Marden 871 - The Saxons are favored to win until exhaustion sets in, giving the Vikings the chance to turn the tables.&#10;&#10;Cynwit 878 - Vastly outnumbered Saxons leave their fort to launch a surprise attack against Viking besiegers; historically, the Saxons won the day and the Vikings were wiped out.&#10;&#10;Ethandun 878 - Alfred's decisive victory over the Vikings. A big long battle with horsies and archers on both sides.&#10;&#10;Wednesfield 910 - Vikings try to make their way across a river and to safety when they're attacked by the ferocious Aethelflaed of Mercia and her less-awesome baby brother, Edward the Elder.&#10;&#10;Corbridge 918 - Constantine II, King of Scotland, defeats three Viking columns one after the other, when a hidden fourth column launches a sneak attack just before nightfall.&#10;&#10;Maldon 991 - The story of Byhrtnoth and his &quot;ofermode&quot;, which turned an easy victory into a defeat and a bloodbath. Didn't help that half his army ran away.&#10;&#10;Assandun 1016 - A pre-game bid for the loyalty of the scheming Eadric Streona may prove decisive in this final clash between Canute the Great and Edmund Ironside.&#10;&#10;",

At the beginning of a round, each player has four turns to set their own scoring and goals for the trick-taking that follows, and this is mostly done by betting. Players can bet on tricks taken, on the number of cards of a given color in your takes, on the last trick, on the highest card taking, or even on the failure of your opponent. Instead of betting, players can choose other actions as well.&#10;&#10;Players can have up to four bets, but only those that you've won will earn you coins. For this reason and because the odds of the bets differ (x2, x3, x4, x5), sometimes instead of betting players will want to take other actions, such as changing one of their cards, doubling an odd, becoming the starting player in the trick phase, changing one of their bets, etc. This is where the tactical depth of Sponsio comes in: finding the best combinations to build your highest score!&#10;&#10;Sponsio is a family-strategy game that can be won in two ways: collecting 30 coins or winning 9 bets in a row.&#10;&#10;",

It's your only weapon in a world rife wtih monsters, necropunks, man-machine hybrids, gunslingers, and power-hungry politicos.  In Malifaux, you lead your crew in the battle for control of the Breach, a dark portal to a world of limitless magic.  Those who don't make it become monsters you must destroy.&#10;&#10;Malifaux is a character-driven 32mm tabletop miniatures game.  Players lead groups, called Crews, in skirmish attacks against their opponents in the magical realm of Malifaux.  Players collect, build, and paint models representing the denizens of Malifaux and pit these Crews against one another.  Masters, powerful practitioners of magic, and those fighting them control these Crews.&#10;&#10;Masters can manipulate the course of events in the world around them, and can change their own fates, through their control or theft of the powerful Soulstones in Malifaux.  A Crew conssists of a variety of fantastic and frightening beings, collectively known as Minions, who serve the Master as fodder in his or her machinations.  In addition, Henchmen can lead specialized Crews in their Master's absence, or serve their Master directly as a member of a Crew.  Masters and Henchmen are also supported by Totems, extension of their magical abilities which increase their spellcasting range and provide additional aid in an Encounter.&#10;&#10;How well a Crew carries out its leader's Strategy and Schemes determiens whether or not it will emerge victgorious in an Encounter with an enemy Crew.  Strategies represent the Crew's main path to victory, while Schemes are simpler alternate routes to achieve the leader's goals.&#10;&#10;Malifaxu players use decks of cards called Fate Decks to resolve game events such as attacking and spell casting.  Players can manipulate the cards they play to alter the Duel's outcome.  It takes a shrewd leader to effectively utilize a Crew's resources, ensuring he or she always has ready the cards needed to Cheat Fate.&#10;&#10;Be Prepared to fight to the death because Malifaux is the end of the line!&#10;&#10;",

Players cooperate in building the brick house and avoiding the wolf until they are all safe inside the brick house.&#10;&#10;Play is basic roll-and-move, with each pig having a die of its own color.  Die results are either move 1, 2, or 3 spaces (in either direction), or move the wolf, or run away to one of the three houses.&#10;&#10;The wolf moves clockwise in jumps that can sweep up any piggies he lands on or passes.  Pigs that are caught are put in the cook pot.  The other little pigs can rescue pigs in the pot if they land on one of the cauldron spaces and roll a die successfully.&#10;&#10;Pigs are safe when they are in a house.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, the brick house is not yet built.  It has four pieces.  When a pig lands on the brick house space, he or she can add one piece to the house.  Once the brick house is completed, the pigs can occupy it.  Once all three pigs are in the brick house, they win.  If the wolf captures all three pigs, however, they lose.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "In January of 1848, an event occurred which changed the face of the west&mdash;gold was discovered on the American River in California. News spread around the world and the era of the 49&rsquo;ers began. Thousands of young people left their farms and homes to make their fortunes out west.&#10;&#10;As these pioneers swarmed to California, hundreds of mining camps sprang up throughout the Mother Lode. Eight miles from the gold discovery site, a camp known as &ldquo;Old Dry Diggins&rdquo; was established. By 1849, it became known as &ldquo;Hangtown.&rdquo;  There are many stories as to how this infamous nickname came to be, but the most common is that in January of 1849, after a very brief trial, three men were hung from a large oak tree near the corner of Main and Center Streets&mdash;an act of swift justice, as they say.&#10;&#10;In April and again in July of 1856, most of Old Hangtown, now bearing the name Placerville, was destroyed by fire. Buildings were ultimately built of brick and stone thereafter. In addition, a large bell tower was erected in the center of town as a fire warning system. By then, people had begun to value the area for more than just mining. The region had an abundance of lumber and rich agricultural land, making it perfectly situated to grow into a thriving community.&#10;&#10;_____________&#10;&#10;In the game of Hangtown, players become Gold Rush era Pioneers who are competing for riches, resources, property, and prestige. &hellip;They must also be prepared to deal with outlaws, shootouts, and hangings at the infamous Hangman&rsquo;s Tree!&#10;&#10;The game features a thoughtful variety of streamlined mechanics, which are notably innovative, yet traditional and familiar in feel&mdash;such as fresh spins on tableau building, worker placement, simultaneous action selection, variable turn order, and resource and hand management.&#10;&#10;Some of the best strategies in Hangtown rely on a balance between optimizing one&rsquo;s own scheme and cunningly &ldquo;playing the players&rdquo;. A standout theme in the game is &ldquo;Boom or Bust&rdquo;. If a player can get &ldquo;out of phase&rdquo; for a turn, he or she will profit from a &ldquo;Boom yield&rdquo; and get bonuses, while the other players may go &ldquo;Bust&rdquo; and get very little. But of course, this takes sharp wits and some clever guesswork&hellip;&#10;&#10;The game is played in a series of rounds, which break down into a series of turns and phases. In a turn, each player selects one card that will determine the phase that his or her Pioneer will take action in. When the players are ready, they simultaneously reveal their chosen cards and place their Pioneer pawns in the corresponding yield sites on the board.&#10;&#10;Then the phases are resolved in numeric order as the players take their Pioneers&rsquo; actions. The total number of Pioneers in each yield site determines whether the outcome is Boom or Bust. To whatever degree, the different site actions allow the players to place workers, activate workers, collect resources, and add cards to their face-up tableau areas of historic buildings, districts, and monuments. Every card built in a tableau grants the player new abilities as well as Victory Points for the final scoring.&#10;&#10;After each turn is completed, the looming Outlaw pawn advances into the next section of the board, locking that particular yield site into a Bust outcome. Furthermore, when the Outlaw lands in the last section, it triggers a &ldquo;Final Shootout&rdquo;! In this special phase, all of the players must defend themselves against the Outlaw&rsquo;s bold attack by using gunmen positioned on Main Street. If the players beat the Outlaw, they gain additional Victory Points as a reward. But if they fail, they must send their lost gunmen to their early graves in the Union Cemetery&hellip;&#10;&#10;The Wild West theme of the game is based closely on the California Gold Rush of 1849 through the turn of the century. The city of Placerville, also known as Old Hangtown, has a rich history, which has been worked into the game at every juncture. For instance, the town cards feature historic landmarks such as the Bell Tower, Soda Works, and Studebaker Wheelbarrow Shop; while the periodic &ldquo;Events&rdquo; feature the Wagon Train, mail delivery from Snowshoe Thompson, and digging up The Mother Lode at Gold Bug Mine. Many beautifully restored historic photographs and illustrations are included as well.&#10;&#10;Hangtown plays wonderfully with two to six players, and it can be set to play in two separate modes: Discovery for newcomers and casual gamers, and Highgrade for seasoned gamers and experienced players. The modes appeal to a wide range of folks and settings&mdash;from light family fun to heavy brain burning. The game also includes an expansion that opens up bidding on several character roles. These roles, such as the Robber, Deputy, Prospector, and Gunslinger, allow each player to use a unique special ability for one entire round at a time.&#10;&#10;The game offers many paths to victory and great replayability.&#10;&#10;",
