    "description": "The Offensive Band Name Generator is a party game for 3 to 20 players. The object of the game is to score the most points by creating clever, funny and fitting band names.&#10;&#10;The game is played with each player being dealt a number of &quot;Word&quot; cards, each card contains four different words that can be used to construct a band name. Players may use as many words as they wish when creating their band names.&#10;&#10;The first player announces a preset goal. For example, &quot;Heavy Metal or Hip-Hop&quot;, &quot;Perverted&quot;, &quot;Food and Drink&quot;, &quot;Offensive&quot;, etc.&#10;&#10;All players then create a band name they feel best fits the current theme. For example, if the theme was &quot;Science Fiction&quot; you may players play band names like &quot;Robot Death Weasel&quot;, &quot;Oprah's Black Hole&quot;, &quot;Martian Ghetto Punks&quot;, or &quot;Hairy Alien Concubines&quot;. The game is designed to create as much hilarity as possible, but may be offensive to some depending on the word combinations chosen.&#10;&#10;Players then vote on who they feel generated the most fitting band name. This player wins the Theme List and one point.&#10;&#10;Players then draw new cards for the next round.&#10;&#10;Play continues for 10 rounds, the player who has the most points at the end of the last round is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

On the way, your ship slams into a rock, not far from the sad sandy shores of Purgatory Island. You manage to escape the sinking vessel on a trusty inflatable flamingo and reach the shore, self-assured that you&rsquo;ve survived a shipwreck and shark-infested waters - only to be bludgeoned by a falling coconut.&#10;&#10;What are the chances?! Well it turns out, there are an average of 150 deaths by coconut per year. You regain consciousness to the realisation the shipwreck has turned your heavenly cruise to Eternal Paradise into a hellish race across Purgatory Island.&#10;&#10;From Coconut Beach, you&rsquo;ve gotta move by backing your betting ability in deciding which of the three options is most deadly. For example: Falling Coconuts, Lightning Strike or Extreme Selfies&#10;&#10;You&rsquo;ll be betting by using the only currency to hand: coconuts (ironically). You&rsquo;ve got a one-in-three chance of getting the answer correct. Which is roughly the same odds as being struck by lightning&hellip; if you play golf in a thunderstorm&hellip; dressed like a medieval jouster.&#10;&#10;Bet small and move cautiously. Bet big and move quickly - but risk going backwards just as fast. Navigate shortcuts and lava flows - you know, the usual features of a deserted tropical island. Oh, and look out for buried treasure, it could be the difference between life and death.&#10;&#10;Whichever tactic you choose, only the first to the finish gets into Eternal Paradise. It&rsquo;s a pretty exclusive guest list - so you better get a move on! Or you&rsquo;ll be wandering the wastes of purgatory for eternity... And that sounds like a fate worse than death!&#10;&#10;So, grab yourself a few fellow shipwrecked shipmates and get going on the race to Eternal Paradise, where your knowledge of death just might save your life.&#10;&#10;",

The notorious Joker attempts to bring the cities under his control and Batman comes to save the day!&#10;One of the players takes the role of the Dark Knight and the other one that of the Joker.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;Each player takes a stack of cards that correspond to his character according to the symbols to the back of the cards.&#10;From the City maps the two cards with zero are discarded, the remaining City maps are juxtaposed in the center of the pitch.&#10;The City tickets are each rotated to their current owners, with each player at the beginning of 4 &quot;is&quot; City Card. &#10;Joker starts the game and then players alternately play.&#10;There are two types of cards: Power cards and Action cards&#10;On his turn the active player takes the top card of his own deck of cards. The card is then applied to the City maps. Just keep in mind that there are power and action cards.&#10;The City maps are quite large. They show a numerical value of 0-4 and a symbol of Batman or Joker.&#10;&#10;The Cards:&#10;1) Power Cards: Each player has in his deck 36 power cards with values &#226;&#128;&#139;&#226;&#128;&#139;from 1 to 12, each card is available three times. A maximum of four cards can be applied on the City maps.&#10;2) KO Card: This card means that the opposing player is obligated to discard the next card that he draws.&#10;3) Stop card: it is placed under a City map. Players use them on the opposing side of the city. Their effect is that the opponent can only go to that city with power cards valued 1 and no other value. &#10;4) Tchomb cards: They can also be stored underneath a city map on the opposing side rendering the cards already there worthless (they now have 0 value)&#10;5) Attack Card: Will be played on an opponent's row and the player can take a power card from that row.&#10;6) Change Map: Players switch roles and change sides.&#10;&#10;The game ends in the round in which neither player can do more to create a map. &#10;The City cards are counted and they are considered to belong to the player who has the higher total numbers on the power cards. In case of a tie, neither player wins the City map. City maps that have been conquered, that belonged to the other players at the start get an extra point to their printed score.&#10;The player with the highest total score wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

On a turn, one player rolls the dice, then each player drafts a die in turn. Players then take turns moving their cows, and if they end their movement in a flower field matching a color they want to eat, then they take a token and cover one of those colored spaces on their board. If they land where another cow is located, they must duel! Roll the cows to see who ends up showing more spots; whoever wins collects clover tokens equal to the number of spots you rolled, and as soon as you have at least four clover, you had in four to cover a flower of your choice.&#10;&#10;Whoever first covers all their flowers, then returns to the cowshed from which they started movement on this circular board wins.&#10;&#10;",

The blocks are part white, part colored, and on the face visible to the blocks' owner, the colors of adjacent blocks must match. Once a structure is finished, a player caps the structure with his crown block. The first player to complete his building grabs the demolition die from the table and (if he built a wall, fort or steps) receives a victory token.&#10;&#10;In the second phase &ndash; the Destruction Phase &ndash; the player with the die chooses a neighboring player, then rolls the die to see whether he attacks like an Ogre (by tossing the die underhanded at that opponent's building), like a Dragon (by dropping the die straight down on that building), or with a boulder (by placing the die on the table, then flicking it at that building). If the attack dislodges that building's crown, the attacker wins a victory token; if not, the defender wins a victory token. Each type of building provides its owner a special power: Forts are immune to boulders, Towers earn an extra victory token when defended, and so on. The attacked player then attacks someone else until everyone has attacked and been attacked once, then a new round begins.&#10;&#10;As soon as someone claims his eighth victory token, he wins the game.

The game board is a grid which alternately shows production areas and spaces for tiles; these tiles show a player color and number, e.g., red 4 or blue 2. A production area grants its building materials or silver to the player with the highest combined value on the adjacent tile edges. The tiles start face-down, and each turn, one of them is revealed. During their turns, players can rotate the tiles, thus influencing who gains which building materials, which are subsequently used to build castles.&#10;&#10;With the unusual turning mechanism of the tiles, every player has the power to distribute the raw materials between himself and the other players on each turn. Building castles then results in victory points, depending on the positions of the villages and cities &ndash; and that's what it's all about if you want to become the most successful landlord!&#10;&#10;The two expansion modules included &ndash; &quot;Dilemma&quot; and &quot;Battle&quot; &ndash; can be combined freely with the basic game.

The game covers a variety of missions including photo recon, patrol, artillery spotting, balloon busting, trench strafing, bombing, and train busting. Data cards are included for 64 aircraft (some of which feature variant models on the same card). There are 12 scenarios.&#10;&#10;Red Baron represented an odd step in the history of the Aces High game system. Red Baron converts the game system to squares instead of hexes, as used in earlier and later editions of Aces High. In addition, Red Baron uses movement points that reflect 10 mph increments (down from 20) to further differentiate between aircraft.&#10;&#10;Published in The Wargamer Magazine number 48.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Venture Party is a fun and simple, 3-7 player, hand management game. Fantasy themes and RPG tropes are turned on their heads in this game full of clumsy and unfortunately ill-fated heroes. Your job, as leader of your Venture Party, is to decide which characters are putting their lives on the line for the team. Discard the unlucky heroes and collect loot to build the strongest party! With the new 16 card built in expansion pack, there is even more potential for mayhem before you reach the bottom of the deck! The land is ripe with opportunity, and only one Venture Party will come out on top. Will it be yours?&#10;&#10;The game begins by dealing 2 Party Members, and 1 Loot Token to every player. At the start of each player turn, they must draw one party member and play one party member from their hand. These heroes are disposable, each with a Power Level value from 1 to 16. Every number has varying effects depending on their Power Level (gathering loot, removing player cards, look at a players hand etc.) Since a Loot Token adds +1 to your party's overall power, Loot handling can sometimes make the difference between the winning and losing parties.&#10;&#10;WINNING: When the deck runs out the game is over. You want to end the game with the strongest venture party. The strength of your party is determined by combining the numbers on your cards with the number of loot tokens you have you your possession.&#10;&#10;Ex: If Pedro has the Necromancer (Level 12) and the Blind Monk (Level 6) and 5 Loot, his score is&#10;12 + 6 + 5 =23&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "This game evolved from (or alongside) Fox &amp; Geese and seems to have appeared first in Germany at least as early as 1803, where it has been known as Belagerungsspiel (Siege Game) or Festungsspiel (Fortress Game.)  In English speaking countries it was published as Siege, or German Tactics. In France it was published in 1855 as Assault. In Italy it is called Assalto, Assalto al Fortino, Assedio di Sebastopoli, and Citadel. Since it is played on essentially a Fox &amp; Geese board with additional markings and pieces, it was often included in a set with rules for Fox &amp; Geese and Solitaire.  The markings outline one nine-point side of the cross as a distinct fortress or castle, typically in a different color from the rest of the board's points.  Also, the horizontal lines of the board are in a different color than the rest, but for the few closest to the fortress.  This is to indicate where the attacker may not move; in some editions these markings are absent and instead simply described by the player's rules of movement.&#10;&#10;The defending player has two pieces in the fortress, either on specific starting points or anywhere the player chooses, depending on the included rules.  The other player has twenty-four pieces, one on each of the board's remaining points.  The goal for the attacking player is to occupy all nine of the fortress points with one of his pieces.  The goal for the defending player is to reduce the attacker to eight pieces, thereby preventing occupation of the fortress.&#10;&#10;Attackers may move along the vertical or diagonal lines towards the fortress only, except on the few marked horizontal lines near the fortress.  They may not jump or capture any pieces.  The defenders may move in any direction along any line, and may capture (remove from the board) an attacker's piece by jumping over it to a vacant opposite point.&#10;&#10;Siege evolved further into a larger edition with a sixty-seven point board, seventeen points for the fortress (and three defending pieces) and fifty points for the attackers.  Sometimes published in Germany and continental Europe as Neues Belagerungsspiel (New Siege Game) or Grosses Festungs-Spiel (Big Fortress Game,) it was known in English-speaking countries as The Royal Garrison Game and has been published under many other names since then.&#10;&#10;Examples of books or game compilations containing Asalto, &#10;e.g :  &#10;'The Boardgame Book&#10;'The Book of Classic Board Games&#10;or&#10;'Medito&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Imperial Storm is a board game for 2 to 9 players set in historical Chinese Court (2-4 players for basic and competitive mode, 5-9 players for casual mode). It is a strategy game about collecting cards, managing your resources and overpowering your opponents: You can rely on princes with promising future to the throne, dukes with enormous wealth and power, or great generals with huge armies in their hands. Or you can ally with consorts plotting to gain favor, the queen ruling the royal harem, or the queen mother reluctant to let go of the puppet string. Even those seemingly innocent maids, or eunuchs murmuring in dark corners can get dirty jobs done. No king rules forever: proper use of limited resource and correct judgment of opponents and situations can help you to take advantage from different sides, survive in merciless conspiracies, and dominate the court in the end.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "The Crow and the Pitcher is a trick-taking game based on the Aesop fable of the same name. Players must play off one another in order to gain points, but the highest suited card is not always the one that takes the trick, so one must be as clever as the Crow in Aesop's fable to score points and not perish from thirst.&#10;&#10;The deck consists of three colored suits of stone cards (numbered 2-10) and one set of black &quot;thirst&quot; cards (also numbered 2-10); a separate deck of pitcher cards has values from 6 to 13, with some duplicates, and one pitcher is revealed each trick. One player leads the first trick with a stone card, and other players must follow suit, if possible. If a player cannot follow suit, she can play a thirst card instead, and from the next round thirst cards can lead the trick. Whoever wins a trick leads the next trick, so winning tricks helps you dictate play.&#10;&#10;If the sum of the colored cards is less than the pitcher value, then the lowest card matching the lead wins; this player gets all cards played (positive points for colors, negative for thirst) and the Pitcher card (worth -5 points). If the sum of the colored cards is equal to or greater than the pitcher value, then the highest card matching the lead wins, and this player gets all cards played (again, positive points for colors, negative for thirst). In all cases, cards valued higher than the trick's pitcher card do not count toward determining whether the pitcher is full.&#10;&#10;If the trick is led by a thirst card, the highest thirst card wins, and that player takes all thirst cards played &ndash; so make sure you hold onto your low value thirst cards to avoid winning a thirst-led trick!&#10;&#10;After three rounds, the player with the high score wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "High Noon: time to stand up and see which of you is the best in the West. Only one cowboy is walking away from this dust up so once you've got'em on the wrong end of a shootin' iron, you better keep'em there. Let loose with everything you've got to win, or play your ace in the hole to turn the tables. Either way you best be the last one standing if you want to win this Do-Si Duel!&#10;&#10;Do-Si Duel recreates the feel of an Old West shootout across the kitchen table. Two players will alternate playing cards to claim actions. These actions move players around the table: players will simultaneously move one seat to the left or the right (always staying on opposite sides), switch places, or simply hold still. The player standing at the &ldquo;Win&rdquo; half of the table when either player runs out of cards is the winner. Complicating this are the various action costs. Each of the four actions has two available slots. The first player to claim that action spends one matching card to use the action and can reuse that action once later at the same cost. The second player must spend two matching cards for that action and can only use it once. Of course, spending more cards isn&rsquo;t always a bad thing: once a player&rsquo;s in position, they&rsquo;ll want to get cards out of their hand quick to end the game! With hand management elements and a unique approach to real-space movement, Do-Si Duel packs a lot of wallop for players looking for a light strategy game.&#10;&#10;&#10;Do-Si-Duel is a 2-player action drafting 18-card game for all ages that can fit in your pocket and be played in 5 minutes!  What makes Do-Si-Duel unique?  In Do-Si-Duel, you are the game piece.  Each action will cause you and your opponent to move (or not move) around the table. The game is simple yet mentally menacing and lots of fun!&#10;&#10;On each turn, players will play cards in the middle of the table on the available actions (left, right, hold, switch) and move accordingly around the table, trying to be on the Win side of the duel at the end of the game (when one of the players has no cards left in hand).&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "An LPS bonus mini-game, Assault On Narvik is a simulation of the ground, sea and air battles that raged around the far northern port of Narvik in Norway during the spring of 1940.  Gamers can take both games and compare just how much each side learned about amphibious operations in the three years that separated the two battles.&#10;&#10;The game has an 11&quot; by 17&quot; map, 95 half-inch counters, 2 pages of charts and tables and 10 pages of rules. The game covers the Allied landings just after the Royal Navy went in and blew out of the water the German destroyer flotilla (that had just landed their troops).&#10;&#10;The game uses a clever mechanic that ties in units' Fatigue Levels whenever they perform any sort of operation (move, attack, defend, retreat, you get the picture). The terrain and weather were so inhospitable that units can get worn down pretty quick, and players have to be thinking ahead to win the game.&#10;&#10;Rules cover formation integrity, air support (mostly the Luftwaffe), limited intelligence, combined arms, even an armistice and/or internment of German units in Sweden. There is a lot packed into this little game, and we're very happy to be able to &quot;shoe-horn it in.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Trek is a fairly straightforward 'expedition' race in which the object is to travel from you base camp to camp number twelve.&#10;&#10;The most appealing elements of the game are the little plastic mules, jeeps and storage crates that are required for the journey. Mules &amp; jeeps are needed for movement; stores are used to sustain the expedition. Additional components include the game board, a sales price indicator, money and a deck of 52 cards.&#10;&#10;Players start with a sum of money and four cards. On his turn, the player must first pay his expenses either with cash or by expending a store. He then plays one (sometimes two) cards and follows the instructions. An 'Authority to Buy' card permits the purchase of one type of commodity (mules/jeeps/stores); the price of these items starts low but steadily increases with demand. Award cards give the player free commodities or allow cheap purchases from a rival. The most common cards, however, are the Camp cards. These are numbered from one to twelve, and playing an appropriate Camp card and transport item allows advancement within the same or subsequent group of camps on the board. If the player has a jeep, he can advance to two camps that turn provided he has two suitable Camp cards available. Money is earned upon reaching a new camp, and the turn is completed by drawing back up to four cards. By moving onto an already-occupied camp, you become the 'guest' of that player which forces him to pay for your upkeep as well as his own until one of you moves away. The winner is the first person to arrive at camp twelve.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Fishermen fish for fresh, fat, and colorful fish &mdash; and if you feel like it, you can join in! In Fat Fish, each player is out to find fat fish of different colors. The fatter the fish, the bigger the haul, and the more colorful the catch is, the more successful the fisherman will be. The player who fishes fabulously and secures the most valuable haul prevails over the other players and wins the game.&#10;&#10;In more detail, the game contains one hundred fish cards in five colors, with the cards numbered 1-6. To set up play, shuffle the deck and deal each player a face-down deck of twelve cards, with everyone drawing a hand of four cards from their own decks. Place three cards face up to form the start of lines, then place another 3-15 cards (depending on the number of players) face down to form a reserve. On a turn, a player chooses one line on which to play, then plays 1-4 cards on this line, playing all the cards in a row from left to right. The color of each card played must match the rightmost card in this line. Thus, if the three starting cards are red, yellow, and blue, you can't play both a red and a blue card since you can play in only one line; you can, however, play a blue card onto the line that ends with a blue card, then play a green card onto the blue since no line has a green card at the end of it. At the end of their turn, the player refills their hand to four cards.&#10;&#10;As soon as a line has five cards in it, the player who laid down the fifth card must take this line and end their turn. They choose one card of each color in the line and place them face up in their positive points pile, then place all remaining cards face down in their negative points pile. (If the line has five cards of one color, the player places two cards in their positive pile instead of only one.) The player then draws a card from the reserve pile to start a new line.&#10;&#10;Once players have played all twelve cards from their personal decks, the game ends and players sum their positive and negative points to see who has the highest score.&#10;&#10;As a variant, Fat Fish includes nine fishing license cards that give players bonus points, sometimes for being the first player to meet a certain condition, such as claiming a line that contains cards of only 1, 2, and 3, and sometimes for meeting a condition at the end of the game, such as having collected the most 1 cards in their positive pile.&#10;&#10;",

Some categories are more &quot;activity&quot; based, such as short term memory, where one has to identify something heard in the clip. In the earlier parts of the game, players can choose their own categories while in the latter, the opponents select.&#10;&#10;In answering questions, players move around a small circular board. The first to make it to the &quot;winner's circle&quot; is the victor.&#10;&#10;",

On a turn, a player moves one piece in a direction matching one of the movement arrows on that piece, with the maximum distance moved being equal to the number of arrows on that piece.&#10;&#10;The blue pivot spaces on the game board allow for tricky plays. If a player moves a piece onto one of these spaces, he can rotate that piece, allowing it to move in any direction for the remainder of its movement. For example, if you're one space away from a pivot with a piece that has three arrows (and is pointing at the pivot), you can move one space onto the pivot, rotate your piece, then move the remaining one or two spaces in any direction now indicated by the piece's arrows.&#10;&#10;You capture movement arrows two ways:&#10;&#10;&bull; Land on an opponent's piece, and you remove a movement arrow of your choice, then place that piece on an unoccupied blue pivot space in any direction you wish.&#10;&bull; Jump an opponent's piece, then remove the one or two arrows on that piece that are parallel to your direction of movement.&#10;&#10;You win by being the first player to capture 17 of your opponent's movement arrows.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Create your agent, infiltrate the island, defeat Necreaux's minions, find the scientists, and escape before time runs out!&#10;&#10;The Island of Doctor Necreaux is a cooperative adventure game for 1 to 4 exceptionally talented secret agents set in a 50s-era pulp-sci-fi world. The diabolical Doctor Necreaux has captured the world's top scientists and forced them to build a Doomsday Device. Your mission: Explore the Doctor's secret island lair, find the scientists, and escape in your shuttlecraft before the island is blown to Kingdom Come!&#10;&#10;In this simultaneous action game, players take one turn together as a team. At the start of each turn, you decide whether you're exploring or resting. When you explore you declare a speed, which represents how quickly you're exploring the island adventure deck and determines how many encounters your team will attempt to resolve this turn. You want to draw as many cards as you can because the scientists are hidden somewhere in the middle of the adventure deck, the escape shuttle is hidden in the bottom, and you have a limited number of turns before the island blows up. However, you can't be too fast or you'll fall prey to one of the island's many traps. If you choose to rest, your team gets to heal up and recharge.&#10;&#10;The Island of Doctor Necreaux incorporates creative ability manipulation (in assessing how player powers interact and applying them appropriately), press-your-luck (when selecting a speed and during combat), and resource management (deciding when to use charges - a scarce resource that fuels agent powers - and when to use a turn to rest instead of explore). The game comes with quick start rules and multiple variants to increase replayabiliy and adjust thr difficulty to accommodate a wide range of player skill. The island and agent skills are all card-based, making the island and the agents different every time.&#10;&#10;We at Invisible City are excited about the improvements in the second edition:&#10;&#10;&#10;     All-new full-color art.&#10;     Almost all cards have their own unique art.&#10;     Full-color art on card fronts and backs.&#10;     More &amp; better components. Bigger box (with room for expansions), better cards, bigger rules, enough dice for all players to play, etc.&#10;     Quick-start rules to make it easy for first time players to play.&#10;     All-new &quot;secret cache&quot; cards to adjust the game for different skill levels.&#10;     Clearer/better ways to increase the difficulty for experienced players.&#10;     All cards are numbered for easy set-up of pre-generated scenarios.&#10;     By popular BGG demand, the game's been re-tooled to use 2d6 as the primary resolution mechanic (instead of 1d6). The rules and every card have been re-written to accommodate this.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

To win the game, a player or team must be the first to score five goals.&#10;&#10;To set up each match, players shuffle their deck of sixty cards, their goal cards, and the communal set of 24 field cards. They lay out five fields cards in a row to create the playing surface; each field card has a number on it. Each player randomly chooses one of his goal cards and places it face-down at one end of the field. Each goal card has a 1 on it. Players then get their cards and wait for the whistle.&#10;&#10;At the same time, players start going through their decks, one card at a time. If a card is unplayable, the player places it face-up in one of two reserve stacks in front of him. A card is playable or not based on this restriction: Moving from left to right, players first need to play a 1 to cover their own goal, then they must play one or more cards that sum to the value on the leftmost field card. Once that card is covered, they play one or more cards that sum to the value on that field card. And so on.&#10;&#10;When a player reaches the opponent's goal, he flips over that goal card to reveal a picture of a goalie and a ball entering the net. He then needs to mix together all of his discards and played cards, flip them over, and start looking card-by-card for four cards that can be fit together puzzle-style to resemble the picture on the back of the goal card. The first player to do this scores a goal and keeps the opponent's goal card; if he made a mistake anywhere, he scored an own goal, so the opponent gets a goal card from him.&#10;&#10;Players then shuffle the cards and go at it once again. The first player to score five goals wins!&#10;&#10;",

Within the storytelling are mechanisms for unexpected turns of events...&#10;&#10;Players begin with a hand of cards, each an element to work into the story being told.  As they tell their story, they play a card, and if they can link multiple cards from their hand together, they receive a bonus of some sort usable later in the defeat of the Great Old One (or his ascension if the player turns out to be a cultist).  If something is mentioned and another player has a card matching what is mentioned, he takes over the story and uses his cards at that point.&#10;&#10;The objective is to tell a great story and then reach the climactic fight between the investigators and the Great Old One which is told in story-format as well.&#10;&#10;Cthulhu's Vault is co-designed by Richard Launius and Jim Dietz.  Launius is the designer of the classic 'Arkham Horror' while Dietz is the author of 'The Cthulhu Rainy-Day Activity Book' and the Lovecraftian novel 'The Last Post'.&#10;&#10;",

Although there was one Infantry Division (8th ID) in reserve, it was too far away to intervene in the first days of the operation. &#10; Despite their great advantage, the Germans did not break through the Polish front lines because the 20th Polish Infantry Division, which defended the Mlawa position, was strengthened by permanent fortifications whose flanks were situated on swamps and wet terrain.  The Germans stormed the defenses for more than three days before they were able to take possession after the Poles abandoned them.  As the German commander of the 3rd German Army could not overcome the Polish positions frontally, he ordered Mlawa to be flanked from the south.&#10;&#10;&#10;The box edition (third) comprises a 39&quot;x27&quot; full color map, 400 die-cut counters and a couple of sheets of informational markers that need to be cut.

    "description": "Be as cunning as a fox!&#10;Each player in turn places a card in front of them: face down if it is a Goose or a Dog, face up if it is a Fox. The player who lays down a Fox card goes on a goose hunt, turning over one of the cards of the player on his left. If it is a goose, he can capture it or continue his hunt by turning over a card of the next player.&#10;&#10;But if it's a dog, he loses all the geese cards turned over as well as his fox...&#10;&#10;In the end, which fox will be able to boast the biggest catch?&#10;&#10;",
