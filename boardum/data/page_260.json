    "description": "Hunter's Guild: The Vampire Forest is a card game in which each player takes on the role of a Hunter seeking out fame, fortune and adventure. A powerful Vampire Lord has awoken from the undead realm, and it's up to you and your Guild to banish him back to his eternal sleep. Battle hordes of evil creatures, discover rare weapons and armors, even risk being infected by the Vampire in search of ancient relics to repel this evil threat. Be the first to collect all four Vampire Slaying Item Cards and track down the Vampire Lord to win the game!&#10;&#10;This fast-paced adventure game uses only cards and a single 20-sided die. Damage, health and inventory are all calculated with cards so there is no need for hit markers, multiple dice, paper or pens. This makes for a fast-paced adventure game that never pulls you away from the action!&#10;&#10;Hunter's Guild: The Vampire Forest introduces a unique way to track damage. Each Hunter, Creature, Armor and Shield card has Health Gems that represent the amount of damage they can sustain. When damage is inflicted, the cards are turned counter-clockwise to represent remaining Health Gems.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Monopoly with a couple of interesting twists.  For kids, the most interesting twists are the canine theme.  All the markers are dogs, the spaces around the board are different breeds, jail has become &quot;the pound&quot; and the houses are actually doghouses.  Community Chest and Chance morph into Trees and Telephone poles (less sophomoric than it sounds) and instead of bank error in your favor you get rewarded for running off the dogcatcher or you have to go to the vet. The theme encourages a more light hearted approach than the serious real estate game.&#10;&#10;For adults the best &quot;twists&quot; are those that speed up the action.  The game does not require you to own all the territories of a given color before you can build a doghouse.  You can only build as many doghouses as you have territories of that color, but you don't have to own them all.  For instance, yellow in Dogopoly has three territories, if you own two of them you could have two doghouses on each, even if the third is unowned, or even owned by another player.  Whenever you first buy a territory you are also given the option to immediately buy a doghouse at half-price.  Taken together these little twists make the game go much faster.&#10;&#10;There are few other twists, like the addition of shortcut paths across the board that can reroute players.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "First was published 'Corona' (1974). Moonstar (1981) added planets and variants&#10;(variant number 8 is Corona, without sand timer). &#10;'Harun' (1984) is not new game, it is a rethemed copy of Moonstar! &#10;'Orbit' (1993) a new variation including the Corona variations &amp; Harun.&#10;Finally, Randolph recycled most of the game into his 'Rasende Roboter' ('Ricochet Robots') (1999) , although the course mechanism and the objective were completely changed.&#10;&#10;Quite possibly the first &quot;German&quot; game to cross the Atlantic...&#10;&#10;About the game (from the back of the box)&#10;&#10;Moonstar is a game unlike any other game for any number of people. All the action is governed by dice, yet there is no luck involved. The dice simply establish the situation. It is up to the players to act upon it. A game with endless variety.&#10;&#10;Playable by any number of people, from one to a hundred, Moonstar combines numbers calculations, memory, and quick-thinking into a fast-playing, action-packed, exciting contest of pure skill.&#10;&#10;The board represents the twelve constellations (stars) of the Zodiac and the playing pieces represent moons and planets. Each game consists of a number of rounds of play. In each round, the board and playing pieces are first setup by one of the players. Then the dice are thrown. A one-minute auction period begins. Each player may bid any number of times in the auction or not at all. Each bid, however, must be higher than the previous one. When the one-minute runs out, the highest bidder plays that round.&#10;&#10;The play of the round also lasts one minute. A player plays a round by placing one die on each moon on the, board and then moving that moon (and die) a number of stars equal to the number of the die. The die is then removed and the moon may not be moved again. This procedure is followed for each moon. The player must move each moon before the time runs out, or those moons which have not been moved may not move.&#10;&#10;The player's score is then totaled to see if he has made his bid, by scoring a number of points for each moon, depending on which stars and planets they have landed on, If a player makes his bid, he scores a number of points equal to his bid. If he fails, he scores nothing. Rounds are setup and played in this manner until one player has scored enough points to win.&#10;&#10;But this is only the beginning. Moonstar is actually twelve games in one. Game One is simply the Basic Game. Games Two-Twelve each change one or more parts of Game One, or add something to it. They introduce things like challenging bids, side bets, more moons, more dice, different planet values, no planets. and advanced scoring methods.&#10;&#10;Includes:&#10;&#10;    16&quot; x 16&quot; gameboard&#10;    15 moon pieces&#10;    21 planet pieces&#10;    1 minute sand timer&#10;    11 6-sided dice&#10;    rulebook&#10;&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Corona&#10;&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Orbit&#10;    Ricochet Robots&#10;&#10;&#10;",

That said, VEC is a &quot;light game made for gamers&quot;, not a storytelling game.&#10;&#10;Players must acquire cards through an auction system. Cards represent the writer's ideas: protagonists, characters, events, places, items, encounters. Cards have special powers and players activate them to interact with other players (move cards, turn cards, refill energy, etc). The aim of the game is to move specific cards to a special zone of the table game area, called the NOVEL area. Cards must be placed there in the right sequence and type/color: each player has a different objective with a different sequence and colors, so as the result will be identical/similar to player objective, victory points will be scored. Card powers can be combined resulting in a huge number of play combinations creating many possible strategies.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Prepare for invasion! Robotech RPG Tactics is a tactical miniatures game set in the Robotech universe. While the 1/285th scale game pieces can be used as a companion to the Robotech RPG, the game system is designed to be played as a tabletop miniatures game. Players build armies of multiple squadrons of mecha to fight it out in scenario-driven, objective-based game play. Take command of the fighting forces of the United Earth Defense Force (UEDF) valiantly defending Earth from alien annihilation &ndash; or lead the massive clone armies of the Zentraedi Armada to recover an alien artifact of immense power and enslave humankind. Depending on the faction, and their choice of mecha, a player's army may include anywhere from two game pieces to as many as you desire! The rules are scalable from small skirmishes to mass combat with hundreds per side.&#10;&#10;Robotech RPG Tactics uses a dynamic turn system. Players trade off activating squadrons during each turn, ensuring that a player never has to sit and wait while his opponent moves and attacks with his entire army. By using alternating activation of squadrons, the game's action unfolds at a fast and furious pace, allowing large scale battles to be easily carried out in a single evening. Each player receives a number of Command Points each turn based on the number of mecha they have on the field, and the quality of their officers. Command Points are spent throughout the turn on maneuvers such as boosted movement, devastating weapon salvos, breakneck dodging counterattacks, and potent special abilities.&#10;&#10;The wide variety of mecha in the boxed game bring to bear the myriad and awesome weapon systems from the Robotech universe to lay waste to your foes. Even the battlefield itself can alter over the course of the game as buildings are leveled by destruction unleashed during the battle.&#10;&#10;",

Every turn, players can rush to finish their work or sabotage those who are pursuing the same potions they are, and once you've completed a potion, you can keep it for victory points or drink it to try to get even further ahead.&#10;&#10;Every turn, players draw cards and 'transmute' a component from a pool they share with all of the other players at the table in order to produce 'elements' (earth, air, fire, water) that can then be combined to try to match the formulas at the bottom of the potion cards that act as victory points.&#10;&#10;Potions are randomized each game, so each match has its own feel - some are very directly competitive, producing potions that allow players to directly attack one another, and others require more indirection and planning. Analyzing the available potions and trying to predict the interplay between them and the value of victory points vs. the effects of the potions is a key element of play.&#10;&#10;",

Next, each player is dealt an equal portion of the remaining deck, and must give information to the opponents; s/he must lay down a card of Higher Value, Lower Value, Different Value, and Different Suit.  Players are given notepads in the style of Clue to make notes about what cards are played, and what can't be the Hidden Card of each player. Then, each player takes it in turn to roll the die, and either reveal more information, or guess at the identity of an opponents' card.  Wrong guesses give no penalty, so you may as well try.  If you're right, you get one point for each card remaining in that player's hand.  This creates reverse suspense: players race to be first, because cards are dropped each round, and five points for last with a Hidden Card unguessed isn't enough to overcome someone who nailed two Hidden Cards early on.  After everyone has revealed their card, whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "This is a simple plain-trick game, suitable for children. It seems to be played mostly in Britain, and is often called by the alternative name Trumps. Any number from two to seven may play. A session consists of seven hands, of diminishing size.&#10;&#10;A 52-card pack is used, with four suits ranking from high to low A K Q J 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2. A player is selected to deal, and deals seven cards each, clockwise. The uppermost of the undealt cards is turned face upwards to indicate the trump suit.&#10;&#10;The player on dealer's left leads to the first trick. Players must follow suit if they can, otherwise they may play any card. Each trick is won by the highest trump in it; otherwise by the highest card of the suit led. The winner of a trick leads to the next trick.&#10;&#10;After the first hand, a second hand is dealt, by the next player in order around the table, with only six cards each. The game continues like this, with one fewer card per player on each hand, until the final hand consists of one card each.&#10;&#10;The winner of most tricks on the first hand chooses the trump suit on the second hand, and so on (i. e. the winner of the second hand chooses trump for the third hand, etc.). If there is a tie for who took most tricks, the players involved in the tie cut cards for the right to choose trumps.  A player who takes no tricks at all in a hand is knocked out, is dealt no more cards, and takes no further part in the game.  There is one exception to the rule about being knocked out: the first player during the game who takes no tricks on a hand is not knocked out immediately but is awarded the &quot;dog's life&quot;.&#10;&#10;The game is won by the winner of the one trick on the final hand. Or if all but one of the players are knocked out before this, the surviving player is the winner.&#10;&#10;Source: pagat.com&#10;&#10;",

Can you win greater bonuses than your competitor by strategically building homes, offices, stores, courthouses, parks and malls in ways that upset your opponent&rsquo;s plans for the city?&#10;&#10;The city district is a 6 x 5 grid with 11 named streets.

Players try to develop each street better than their opponent to claim its bonus.&#10;&#10;Each player keeps a hand of 5 Building tiles out of 20 available to them. When placing a tile on an empty city block, if the tile completes a street (a row or column) they compare the value of their Buildings on the street to their opponent's Buildings to determine who wins the bonus. A straightforward comparison simply involves adding the number of each tile: Residential Buildings count from 1 to 5, Commercial Buildings count from 2 to 6 and Industrial Buildings count from 3 to 7. However, four types of special tiles change how the bonus is determined: a Park or Mall prevents either player's Industrial Buildings from counting towards the bonus on a street; a Power Plant or Mall prevents Residential Buildings from counting towards the bonus. Finally, the Courthouse allows the player to switch the bonuses of two streets.&#10;&#10;Instead of placing a tile on an empty block, a player can discard a Currency token and build over a block they have already developed.&#10;&#10;Whoever has the most money wins, and earns a key to the city from the mayor!&#10;&#10;",

This Disney version of Meme the Game is more kid-friendly than the original, and is perfect for the entire family.&#10;&#10;To setup, shuffle the Word Card deck and the Picture Card deck separately, and the oldest player serves as the dealer. Each player receives three Word Cards and three Picture Cards, which are dealt face down and kept private from other players.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to create the funniest &ldquo;meme&rdquo; combining one picture card and one word card from your hand. To start, the first Dealer serves as the &ldquo;judge&rdquo;, who does not submit a meme that round, and other players submit their best picture-and-word combo for the judge to analyze. The judge determines the funniest meme created, and the player who submitted the best meme is given one point. After each round, it is important that every player draw a new word and picture card to bring the total number of cards in his/her hand back up to six (three word cards and three picture cards). From there, the &ldquo;judge&rdquo; responsibilities are passed to the left, and play continues until one player gains five points (that is, wins five rounds with the best meme).&#10;&#10;Contents: 112 picture cards, 88 word cards, and instruction sheet.&#10;&#10;Note: There is another boxed version with 225 picture cards and 175 word cards.&#10;&#10;",

Players must not violate her strange rules or those of her crazed consort, BullyQ, while attempting to rise further in her favor, or possibly even overthrow her rule.&#10;&#10;Mad QUAO is a lightweight hierarchy card game with a few twists. Players take turns playing cards on a central pile and drawing new cards, seeking to empty their hands as soon as the draw deck runs out. The order that players go out determines the hierarchy for the next round.&#10;&#10;But at the beginning of each round, the QUAO adds a new bizarre QUAO Rule Card to the game. If a player breaks a QUAO Rule, they must draw a card &ndash; and so must all of the lower-ranked players. (Of course, the player who caught them gets immunity!) Over the course of the game, other special cards may come up. Bully Rules are similar to QUAO Rules, but affect only one player. In addition, the lower-ranked players have access to a few special Wild Cards in the deck, but they require players to perform stunts.&#10;&#10;The end result is a card game in which you can rise from the ranks of the chicken proletariat to ruler of The Farm through good play and a lot of luck, but you might also have to win a fashion runway walk-off, talk only through a sock puppet, and never say the word &quot;turn&quot;.&#10;&#10;Good luck, QUAOmrade!&#10;&#10;",

The old machines are rusted and broken and the scavengers of Gearworld live off scraps from the past and refuse from the Sky People's flying cities. The scavengers' only hope for a better life is to build great towering skyworks and gain the favor of the World Above, allowing them to outlast and outlive their rival scavenger gangs. In the Borderlands, survival is an exception.&#10;&#10;Gearworld: The Borderlands is a game of conquest and survival in a post-apocalyptic world for 2-4 players who must gather resources and use them wisely. Players need those resources in order to strengthen their military might, to enhance their transport capabilities, and to reach the final goal of building the skyworks. Resources can be produced in areas with resource tokens, traded with other players, and taken by force. To build a development &ndash; e.g., weapons, transport vehicles or skyworks &ndash; all of the required resources have to be located in the same space on the map. This makes effective transport an important issue in the game. At the same time players must be strong enough to protect their resources from the other players while investing resources in their skyworks in order to win the game.&#10;&#10;Seize territory, marshal resources and defend yourself from your rivals. Reclaim the machines of old to build powerful weapons and enormous skyworks. Can you forge a new future from the rusted remnants of the past?&#10;&#10;Microbadges:&#10;  &#10;[microbadge=28656 original inline] Gearworld: The Borderlands fan&#10;&#10;",

Nine double-sided bomb tiles are placed to the side, and each bomb tile shows either a color or a symbol, but not both.&#10;&#10;Everyone plays simultaneously, with each player flipping her chips one by one, flipping chips in the center of the table one by one, and swapping one of her chips for one of the publicly available chips. As soon as all seven of a player's chips match one of the target bombs &mdash; say, by being all pink or all triangles or one of each color &mdash; that player yells &quot;Boom!&quot; She then identifies the matching bomb, places one of her chips aside as a one-point scoring marker, draws a new chip from the bag, then flips over that bomb before play resumes.&#10;&#10;If a player matches two bombs simultaneously &mdash; e.g., all blue and one of each symbol &mdash; she sets aside two tokens instead of one. If a players matches the Bubble Bomb, which calls for one of each color and one of each symbol, she claims the Bubble Bomb (even if another player claimed it earlier), then swaps all of her chips for seven in the middle of the table before play resumes; the Bubble Bomb is worth three points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;With four players, the game ends when the final chip is drawn from the bag and the player with the most points wins; with 2-3 players, the first player to collect nine points wins.&#10;&#10;",

The player who controls the monster has a mobile device, which is the main tool of the game. They move around the same fields as the Scientists, but their movement can only be detected on a screen.&#10;&#10;The monster has to fulfill its mission before it's captured by the Scientists. Within the mission the monster has to stand in the immediate vicinity of a given place. Together, the Scientists have to guess the current whereabouts of the monster using only the sound played by the mobile device after it completes its move. Using their skills, the players try to predict the route taken by the elusive Monster and catch it before it causes trouble!&#10;&#10;",
