    "description": "The Collector's Box features upgraded components but also more game play content that won't be in the retail version.&#10;&#10;There will be more characters, more cards, and different variants of the same components such as metal coins.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Over the years, a lively town has fallen into ruin. Disturbing stories that surround Bedeville can send shivers down your spine. One of them, often considered the most real, tells a tale of Mr. Carl - a grave keeper and a grim owner of a local theme park.Mr. Carl arrived in Bedeville back when life and happiness bloomed in every corner of this little town. As a juggler and later - grave digger in a nearby graveyard, he barely made the ends meet. How did he get the fortune that let him create a theme park? We will probably never learn. Some think that he made a pact with a malignant, and fun-loving Trickster. That&rsquo;s the only explanation for what happened next, including the nightmare, that led Bedeville to its downfall. Citizens were forced to leave this grim place while Mr. Carl ended up doomed to eternal torment. What kind of torment? Having his theme park be visited by &ldquo;unique&rdquo; guests like the undead from the nearby graveyard. Additionally, to make Mr. Carl even angrier, they&rsquo;re invited every night by the ticket seller, who opens the grounds of Bedeville Carnival when dusk arrives.&#10;&#10;This is where your adventure begins. As corpses from the nearby graveyard, you will visit the crazy attractions of the theme park. It doesn&rsquo;t matter when and how you ended up in this burial ground. Each night an eerie force makes you wake up from the eternal slumber and feel alive again. Each night you will discover new attractions and collect Souvenirs before they&rsquo;ll get grabbed by grave digger&rsquo;s mean cat called Fleabag. But beware! Mr. Carl can catch you anytime and chase you back to the cemetery.&#10;&#10;The game is played in consecutive player turns. Each player has the goal of collecting the most Joy Markers and Souvenirs sold in the local Booths. When all Souvenirs end up being sold to the players - the game concludes. The player, who at the end has the most victory points awarded for their Joy Markers and Souvenirs collected, becomes the winner.&#10;&#10;Every Player picks their favorite undead unafraid of any, even the most dangerous Attractions. Next, you draw the crazy Attractions that the characters will move through during the game. By visiting more and more Attractions and performing Actions from the Attractions you will attempt to outsmart your graveyard friends. By using Actions in a smart way a Player will attempt to hold their position on a specific Attraction. Only this way they will be able to buy Souvenirs next turn. At the end of each turn, a player draws one Trickster&rsquo;s token from the bag and checks what destiny has for them in-store. Attractions generate Noise Markers. The more Noise, the bigger the chance that the Attractions will make the grave keeper arrive and chase the player&rsquo;s character back to the graveyard.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "The third game in the Shields &amp; Swords II series tackles two unusual engagements. In both battles, the &quot;invincible&quot; Livonian Order - an autonomous branch of the Teutonic Knights - met their enemies atop a frozen body of water, and in both cases, they suffered a humiliating defeat.&#10;&#10;The 1242 battle at Lake Peipus was immortalized in Sergei Eisenstein's rousing film &quot;Alexander Nevsky&quot;, and is probably the first thing most folks think of when they hear &quot;Battle on the Ice&quot;. This battle should have been a cakewalk for the Livonians, as their elite, well-armed, ruthless cavalry were facing a feudal army of peasants. But Nevsky exhibited sound tactical judgment, and a deployment of his own cavalry at just the right time turned the tide decisively in his favor. Similar to THE GRUNWALD SWORDS or S&amp;S I game OUR ROYAL BONES, this battle allows the Novgorod Player to choose the exact moment to bring in his horse archers (making their first appearance in the S&amp;S II series). The longer he waits, the more VP he'll score, but the greater the chance that it'll be too late.&#10;&#10;The 1270 Battle of Karuse, fought on the frozen Baltic Sea, is a bit more obscure, but quite possibly more interesting. This time around it's the Livonians and their allies against a Lithuanian Army under Grand Duke Traidenis. The Lithuanians use sleds as a defensive barrier, and use hit-and-run tactics to unhorse the bold brothers. Special rules for unhorsing, dismounting, and charging the sleds give this one a lot of nuance.&#10;&#10;Both battles see a force that's strong in cavalry brought low by a force that's predominantly fighting on foot. Semi-random force pools utilized in each battle provide additional replayability. As always, the core S&amp;S II system - easy to learn, teach, and play - allows for a fun, fast, streamlined medieval experience.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

It's up to each player to correctly guess the 3 attributes of their secret card correctly, to win the game. On a player's turn, a player will play a card down in front of them and ask the player to their left if the card played, has any matching attributes of the secret card that player is holding. If there's a match, the other player will honestly say, yes or no. The asking player then draws another card from the draw deck. It's then up to the asking player to organize and deduce which 3 elements are on their secret card. Eventually through deduction, a player will think they have figured out what their secret card is. When a player is confident they know what their secret card is, instead of playing a card and asking, they will announce the 3 attributes on their card. For instance, &quot;I think my secret card is a 7, black solid circle.&quot; If they are the first player to correctly guess, they win! If the player guesses any of the attributes incorrectly, they lose and are out of the game. That player must lay all their cards out into the open for other players to see.&#10;&#10;If the draw deck runs out, players continue to play the cards they have in hand and if they still fail to guess correctly, they lose!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Players control an organization with the resources and intent to explore, develop, and colonize the worlds beyond Earth. Organizations that practice careful planning and resource management, with a healthy dose of technology research will succeed. Destination: Neptune moves through four generations of space exploration. Players earn Victory Points by building large commercial outposts and colonies, as well as from fame and outright purchases. After four generations, the player with the most Victory Points wins the game.&#10;&#10;This is a card driven game in which most Cards have an action that happens immediately, and another action for all of the players (including the player who played the card). Players can also sell cards in exchange for currency. When you sell a card, it goes to an Opportunity Track and is placed to the side of the board. If the Opportunity Track already has as many cards as players, the rightmost card is discarded. You may not change the order of the cards in the Opportunity Track. Players can play cards from the Opportunity Track as if they were in their hands.&#10;&#10;Players must use the cards to gain currency and fuel in order to launch space missions to establish bases, factories and colonies on various locations within our solar system. Careful hand and resource management is key to winning the game. In addition, players also need to research certain technologies in order to build on most locations. Technologies are researched through card play and paying currency. The cards are separated into 4 piles which are separate generations. At the end of each generation, each player scores points for the various structures they've built. The game ends when all generation piles have been exhausted.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Great Pacific War is Avalanche Press' strategic-level game of the War in the Pacific. The game covers the entire war from December 1941 through 1946 and includes the forces of all participants. Players are placed in the positions of the commanders of the Japanese, British, Soviet and American forces in World War Two.&#10;&#10;The system is the same one used in Avalanche Press' game, Third Reich. In addition to five scenarios covering all or part of the War in the Pacific, Great Pacific War includes rules to link it and Third Reich to play the Second World War, a simulation of the entire conflict with up to seven players. Included in the game are five scenarios for the Great Pacific War and three scenarios for the linked Second World War. One of the Great Pacific War scenarios covers a possible 1931 conflict between Japan and America as postulated by the British journalist Hector Bywater in his book of the same title.&#10;&#10;The facts:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Game scale is 60 miles per hex covering the battlefield on three 34&quot; x 22&quot; maps. Units are represented at corps, fleet and air army level. Each turn represents three months of actual time.&#10;     The game system is built around players drawing impulse &quot;chits&quot; to determine how they can activate their forces. The emphasis is on the interaction of military, political and economic factors (as in Third Reich).&#10;&#10;&#10;The game system from our Third Reich game allows players to control the military, political and economic destinies of their nations in a struggle to dominate the world. Land, air and sea forces battle across almost a third of the earth's surface as the two mightiest navies fight for control of the Pacific. Players manage their economies and build and operate their military forces within the capabilities of their nations' abilities.&#10;&#10;In Great Pacific War the Japanese player must decide initially whether war with America or the Soviet Union will be his or her strategy. Japan&Iacute;s lack of resources make a war with one or the other a necessity. Also possible is a war with Britain and her ally, The Netherlands, who together control the riches of India, Java and Borneo. This strategy has many risks, the greatest being that America will enter the war on Britain's side. Coloring all is the massive Japanese investment in China and the importance of those conquered territories to the Japanese economy. The American player must move a nation unprepared for war to a position of strength, while attempting to support the Nationalist Chinese in their conflict with the Japanese.&#10;&#10;In the linked game players have also to consider the effects of their actions on the global conflict. A Soviet player desperately defending Moscow in 1941 can little afford a Japanese attack on Vladivostok. Likewise a British player fighting Germany with only a seemingly soon-to-be-defeated Soviet Union as an ally, will not welcome a Japanese attack on his eastern possessions unless it brings America into the war. Historically Japan went to war to obtain the resources denied her by the Allies embargo of steel and oil and because German successes appeared to offer Japan the opportunity to join a victory almost already won. The question is whether you and your allies can do any better than your historical counterparts.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;3 34&rdquo; x 22&rdquo; maps&#10;2 countersheets consisting of 560 counters&#10;1 rulebook...separated into 2 booklets&#10;2 scenario booklets&#10;1 &quot;Policial Maker Explanations&quot; booklet&#10;1 Off-Map Movement and Sea Zones Chart 11&quot; x 17&quot;&#10;1 Chart with US Entry/Russian Winter Table/Mud Table&#10;1 Chart with Sequence of Play/Alliance &amp; Individual Victory Tables/Construction and Repair Costs&#10;1 Terrain Effects Chart&#10;1 Turn Impulse Track&#10;1 Production Costs&#10;9 Force Pool Charts(Netherlands,Britain,Soviet Union,Nationalist China,Communist China,United States(x2),Japan(x2))&#10;&#10;&#10;Note: &#10;The maps are not mounted like those in JP&#039;s Third Reich were.  This solves the problem of the maps not adjoining properly (as in Third Reich), but will upset those that like hard mounted maps. &#10; The game marries up with JP&#039;s Third Reich, but don't expect the maps to do so.  When played together, action will be on separate maps to create a monster game of the entire Second World War.&#10;&#10;",

If the sum is equal to or lower than the guard's value, then whoever played the highest block of this color earns points equal to the value of the cards played and everyone else scores one point per card of this color; if the sum surpasses the guard's total, then the player with the highest sum throws away his cards of this color, then you recheck the sum.

To set up the game, you divide the number tiles into four piles based on the number of scarabs on them, with more scarabs typically signifying larger numbers. To create the number pyramid, you lay out one tile with four scarabs, two tiles with three, and so on.&#10;&#10;On a turn, one players rolls the three dice &ndash; an octahedron, a decahedron and a dodecahedron &ndash; then all players try to use the four fundamental arithmetic operations to transform the numbers on two or three of the dice to match one of the numbers on a tile. For example, amongst the cards on the board is a 72 and you rolled two 8s and one 1; you can calculate 8 x (8 + 1) and the result is 72. As soon as a player has reached a target number, she takes that tile off the game board, then flips the thirty-second sand timer. Everyone else can grab one tile during this time, then once time expires the players must demonstrate how they reached the number in question. If a player calculated correctly, she keeps the tile face-up; otherwise she flips it face-down as a penalty.&#10;&#10;Players then fill up empty spaces on the game board, then roll the dice again to start another round. As soon as a row cannot be filled, the game ends. Players then tally the scarabs they collected, subtract penalty scarabs, and see who has the highest score.&#10;&#10;",

There are 6 different types of cards that can be drawn. Seals, Blessings, Curses, Demon Marks, Hexes, and Haunting Cards. Haunting Cards trap players in rooms, where they must follow the card's instructions and terrorize visiting players. Our brave human players are attempting to retrieve enough Seal Cards and get them back to the Home Room, but if they draw too many demon Mark Cards they can become possessed and secretly change to the demon's team.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Quest for the DragonLords is a world conquest game where cunning is required to best manage your forces comprising of fleets and armies. Your goal is to dispatch your opponents&rsquo; King or Queen! You start the game with a few powerful leaders such as Wizards and a King. A DragonLord commander allows a player to teleport and attack anywhere in the known world! The fear generated by a DragonLord with its weapon of destruction &ndash; Dragon fire, reduces the fighting effectiveness of enemy forces.&#10;&#10;The adventure continues in the wastelands comprising of various places of commerce such as villages, shrines, witch dens, Dragon Lair, Teleportal and oracles. Here, quest parties may consult with witches to gain tools such as a DragonOrb to complete your quest or visit the Oracle who will enlighten adventurers with words of wisdom from the gods.&#10;&#10;So what&rsquo;s new? &#10;The second edition of &ldquo;Quest for the Dragonlords&rdquo; has been re-designed with all new graphics and subtle changes to game play to deliver a much more intense gaming experience. The gameboard has been completely redesigned with lush graphics to bring the adventure element of the game to the forefront. Each player can hire heroes to help their quest parties overcome difficulties on the various quests.  &#10;The prophecy cards allow players to interact with each other during the adventure phase. The prophecy cards give clues to the players where powerful treasures may be found but they also allow players to provoke the various companions of the other players to betray their quest parties. There are 20 beautifully illustrated quest cards of drooling monsters and demons of darkness for your quest parties to overcome.  &#10;The manufacturing process has been improved from the first edition to provide highly detailed plastic miniature Orcs, Elves, Dwarves, Barbarians, Longships and DragonLords. Each civilization now has a completely unique set of spells available to their Wizards. Each player when in favour of the gods of power may gain mana. Mana is now required to cast spells and may be redeemed for powerful scroll cards that can greatly affect the outcome of battles. &#10;Drawing on the legends of Norse mythology and the intense graphics provided in the second edition of &ldquo;Quest for the DragonLords&rdquo; &ndash; A Fantasy Game of Adventure and World Conquest provides a very rich atmosphere. If you are looking for a game to provide an evening of strategy and adventure for your favourite knights of the round table, Quest for the DragonLords will be a feast for your friends.&#10;&#10;There is an expansion available, called Crystal of Power, which adds the Amazones and the Nekromants, for the 5th and 6th player. Also some colored Power crystals wait to dicover on your quests through the lands.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "It is February 1813. The defeated remnants of the once invincible Grande Arm&eacute;e have arrived back in the West. Despite the catastrophe in Russia, all is not lost for Napoleon.&#10;&#10;On the European mainland, only Russia is openly at war with France. In theory, the other powers, Austria, Prussia and the German States, still remain allies. Can the Emperor recruit a new army and secure sufficient military success to persuade his allies to stand firm; or bolstered by the Russian advance, will they turn against the French? &ldquo;1813: Napoleon&rsquo;s Nemesis&rdquo; simulates this fascinating campaign which determined the shape of nineteenth-century Europe.  &#239;&#187;&#191;&#10;&#10;The Game (designed by Steve Pole)&#10;&#10;1813: Napoleon&rsquo;s Nemesis&rdquo; is strategic in scope. Combat units represent all the divisions (categorised as veterans, line or conscripts) which took part to the campaign, together with the most important commanders. The game presents strategic options corresponding to those available to Napoleon and the Coalition forces, and replicates the consequences which flow from each. At the same time, it captures the essence of campaign warfare during this period &ndash; sweeping manoeuvres, feints and deceptions, forced marches, and the greater flexibility and cohesion of seasoned troops &ndash; as well as the crucial matter of logistics. The Basic Rules are simple and can be learnt very quickly minimising the amount of time players need to spend consulting the Rulebook. Optional Rules and Advanced Rules (including cards) add even more realism and sense of period. &#10;   &#10;The &ldquo;1813: Napoleon&rsquo;s Nemesis&rdquo; is the second volume of a projected series of games at the same scale (the first being &quot;The Invasion of Russia (1812)&quot;), covering all the major campaign of the Napoleonic Wars at a strategic level.&#239;&#187;&#191;&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Dogs: Card Game was inspired by the original version, which has five editions, four in Brazil and one in the USA.&#10;&#10;It offers a dynamic experience and very different from the board version.&#10;&#10;The game plays up to 5 players, games are faster and the mechanics, although simpler, appeal to casual players to those more experienced in the hobby.&#10;&#10;On his turn, the player chooses a place in the city to visit. There, he performs one or two actions in any order: (1) Collect dogs and (2) Hire a character. There are five different types of dogs: healthy, sick, trained, lost and looking for accommodation. The characters in turn improve the actions of the players: Kennel Manager, Trader, Veterinary, Handler and Partner.&#10;&#10;With quick turns and varied play options, Dogs: Card Game is a lightweight set collection, with a hint of resource management and character selection, ideal for introducing new players to the hobby. In addition, it can also be played perfectly with children from 8 years old, with only a few adjustments to the rules.&#10;&#10;",

If you're the first to reach Level 10, you win! However, watch out for conniving villains such as Bigtime Beagle or Curses that could distract you from becoming filthy rich.&#10;&#10;The treasure hunt begins as soon as the first player &quot;Kicks Open a Door&quot; to reveal what's hidden on the other side. If a villain is nowhere to be found, you'll be free to use your Class skills to &quot;Loot the Room&quot; for hidden items and treasures. Will you uncover the Crown of Genghis Khan or Magica's Magic Mirror to aid you on your quest? If you're not so lucky, you'll be greeted by that stingy Flintheart Glomgold, the wicked Magica DeSpell, and other bad guys that must be defeated using card bonuses, powerful Treasure items, Ally cards such as Bubba the Caveduck and Donald Duck, or even teaming up with other players! Choose your friends wisely!&#10;&#10;When you're feeling as mischievous as Huey, Dewy, and Louie, you may also decide to &quot;Look for Trouble&quot; and fight a monster already in your hand.

In ancient times, when humans were nothing more than slaves, the Isle served as the main gateway between Midgard and the Old Worlds.&#10;&#10;The first Summoners rose up to lead the humans in the battle that pushed the Old Ones back into their own realms, and &ndash; at great cost of life &ndash; the Summoners closed the gateway. It is believed that the enormous sacrifice of our ancestors is the reason why spirit energy remains so abundant on Summoner&rsquo;s Isle today.&#10;&#10;Capable of absorbing spirit energy and using it to call forth wondrous creatures, Summoners travel the land to where they are most needed, to repel raiders, push back the native wild beasts, and &ndash; most importantly &ndash; to siphon off spirit energy where it starts to gather.  For if too much spirit energy pools, it forms a Well, a passageway to the Old Worlds, where monsters and god-like beings still dwell, ready to make Midgard their own again, and enslave humankind once more.&#10;&#10;&bull;&bull;&bull;&#10;&#10;In Summoner&rsquo;s Isle you are an unproven adept, competing in a rite of passage to prove that you have full command over your creatures. To do so you must apply careful strategy, prove yourself in combat and most importantly, demonstrate your ability to absorb large quantities of spirit energy. Only once you have achieved all three will you graduate to the mainland to take your place among the exalted ranks of the Summoners.&#10;&#10;",

Alliances have worn thin, and the thirst for power has driven them to war with each other.  But they are not the only forces vying for power.  The Malador, foreign marauders, have taken advantage of the chaos to satisfy their lust for conquest and plunder by ravaging the land.&#10;&#10;In War of Kings, you will assume the role of one of the rival kings.  Immediately, you will be faced with decisions on every round of play about how best to expand your realm.  During the Construction Phase, in which all players play simultaneously, you will generate resources, collect gold, build settlements, fortify them, and raise armies.  The combat system provides many opportunities for tactical and strategic decisions.  Wage war with our custom combat dice using a mechanic that engages both the attacking and defending player.  You must also contend with the Maladorian Marauders, an evil horde controlled by a card-based mechanic that allows the players to decide how best to wreak havoc on the other kingdoms of Arowyth.&#10;&#10;",

It is based on the Grimm Fairy Tales and the artwork of Arthur Rackham.&#10;&#10;The game has two types of cards, Prize Cards and Bidding Cards. Both the Prize Cards and Bidding Cards have powers and combinations that cause players to rework and execute evolving strategies throughout the game.&#10;&#10;The Prize Cards are captured in a series of four bidding rounds and have different values (Victory Points) which are triggered by the types of cards each player captures. A summary of their follows are as follows:&#10;&#10;     A Prince and A Princess are worth (0) alone and (12) a piece when paired,&#10;     The Angel Mother can turn the Maiden card into a princess,&#10;     The Maiden has a value of nine (9) on her own,&#10;     The Witch is worth negative thirteen (-13) alone and positive thirteen (+13) if combined with both Hansel and Gretel,&#10;     Gold cards are worth one (1) on their own and are worth two (2) when collected with the Dragon,&#10;     Rumpelstiltskin can also turn any card into a Gold card, and&#10;     Dwarf cards increase exponentially when the player collects &#10;&#10;&#10;more Dwarf cards. One card is worth one (1) point to the player, two cards are worth four (4) points to the player, up to seven cards are worth forty-nine (49) points to the player.&#10;&#10;The Bidding Cards are from 0 - 7 and are used to capture the Prize Cards. The bidding tactics each player employs are based on how others bid and capture cards, a player's individual Prize Card strategy, and each player's reading of their opponents. A few Bidding Cards have special rules:&#10;&#10;     0/8 Dove&mdash;usually acts a zero (0), the lowest bidding card, but when a step-sister card is played&mdash;it becomes an eight (8), the highest card.&#10;     1 Goose&mdash;when three or four players are playing, if two (2) goose cards are played, the fox card becomes worth zero (0).&#10;     3 Cat &amp; Mouse&mdash;can only be used once per game (rather than once per round as the others). This card is bid face up and then the Cat &amp; Mouse bidder(s) bids one more card face down before the other bidding cards are turned face up.&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

If the dice don't go your way, you can cash in your chips for an extra roll, an extra turn, or perhaps a new card.  The player that successfully completes their challenges--while wisely using their chips and re-rolls--is crowned the &quot;Combo King.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

Units are rated for training class which affects demoralization and recovery. The armies represented are Austria, Bavaria, Saxony, Prussia, and Prussian Allies (K.of Italy). There are three shorter scenarios and one campaign scenario. National Will and political events affect rally and mobilization. Most of the charts and tables needed are on-map, with two System Rules and APW player aid sheets within the ruleset.&#10;&#10;The System rules were udated and replace the earlier set in the previous titles.

One player takes the role of Julius Caesar and controls the Roman forces, their Gallic allies and German mercenaries.

Morale and oxygen levels need to be constantly monitored.&#10;&#10;Each challenge deck tells a different sci-fi story. The base set comes with a 2001: A Space Odyssey style &quot;AI&quot; deck.&#10;&#10;During a turn players receive movement cards allowing them to position their crew throughout the ship. Crew in specific locations can then activate ship systems or crew specific abilities in order to, for example, generate oxygen, raise morale, or repair the ship. The crew's locations can also complete certain missions such as when searching the ship or realigning the solar panels.&#10;&#10;Throughout the game the overall threat is represented by a challenge deck. Some of the cards of the challenge deck will generate missions representing the crew dealing with the problems presented by the deck. Crew will vote on engaging with such missions, balancing their ability to complete the missions and earn their rewards with the risk of failing and suffering the consequent punishments. If the mission is not voted for it is aborted but may arise again. The challenge deck represents a specific narrative threat that players must progress through. The deck supplied with the base set of the game tells the story of the ship's AI having wiped out the original crew, attempting to kill off the players' rescue mission by suffocation or dumping the crew into space.&#10;&#10;Players need to communicate movement options to efficiently use the limited space of the ship and work together to activate and complete missions. Meanwhile they must be constantly aware that with a limited shared oxygen supply and victory being available to each player individually, betrayal to extend limited supplies is a constant threat. The game is won by the challenge deck being exhausted and lost by players running out of crew. Although players need to work together in a co-operative fashion to complete missions and maintain the ship, they win or lose as individuals.&#10;&#10;Although the game does not require players to work against each other via betrayal mechanics oxygen supplies are shared such that an individual players personal odds of success rise as other players' crew are eliminated thus offering a semi-co-op experience. The game can be played in an entirely co-op fashion however depending on players taste.&#10;&#10;",

Deeply entrenched in American culture, and with deeper pockets, they leveraged their lobbyists and marketing to avoid regulation and dodge responsibility for a hundred million deaths. A disparate collection of scientists, grassroots activists, politicians, lawyers, and public health officials faced an uphill battle to change the culture, place limits on tobacco advertising, and combat a health crisis of unprecedented scope.&#10;&#10;This game from designer Amabel Holland (Nicaea, Endurance) models the asymmetry of this conflict by giving each side a different game. The Company, representing the industry, plays an economic deckbuilder, setting themselves up for big turns, chains of actions, and big profits. The Movement that opposes them is playing a political tableau builder &ndash; slowly coming together and organizing to advocate for legislation and regulation. These two halves, each with its own mechanisms and components, intersect the most fully in the disinformation war. Illustrating Brandolini&rsquo;s Law &ndash; &ldquo;the amount of energy needed to refute bullshit is an order of magnitude bigger than that needed to produce it&rdquo; &ndash; the Company player easily muddies the water, while the Movement must work hard to clear it away.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "The deluxe edition has new graphics, updated rules and more cards from the previous edition.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;The sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great river Euphrates, and its water was dried up to prepare the way for the kings from the East&hellip;&#10;&#10;&ldquo;Then they gathered the kings together to the place that in Hebrew is called Armageddon.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;(Revelation 16: 12, 16)&#10;&#10;The Bible contains prophecies about the final days, describing how the armies of the World will fight the final battle and that without divine intervention, no life shall be saved (Matthew 24:22). Certain Biblical scholars have described how closely these prophecies correlate to our modern times and put forward scenarios for this climactic battle.&#10;&#10;The Battle of Armageddon - Deluxe is a 2 to 6 player game dealing with this final battle. The game brings together the forces of the World into the ultimate battle for control of the Earth:&#10;&#10;Israel: the children of the Holy Land, promised peace by the Antichrist and betrayed by the World (1 Thessalonians 5:3)&#10;&#10;Arabs: the King of the South, including Cush (Arab Africa), Put (Black Africa), and Persia (Iran) (Daniel 11:40, Ezekiel 38:5)&#10;&#10;Magog: from the extreme northern parts, along with Gomer and Togarmah led by Gog, chief prince of Meshech and Tubal (Ezekiel 38:1-6)&#10;&#10;Revived Roman Empire: a European empire of 10 nations, led by the Antichrist, shall gather the armies of the World to battle (Revelation 16: 13-15)&#10;&#10;United States: who dwell safely in the isles (Ezekiel 39: 6).&#10;&#10;Kings of the East: an army 200 million strong (Revelation 9: 16)&#10;&#10;The 19 x 33&Prime; game map represents the battleground, stretching from Egypt to Iran. The 216 5/8&Prime; counters (die-cut and back-printed) represent the armies of Israel, the Arabs, Magog (Russia), the Revived Roman Empire (Europe), USA and the Kings of the East (China). The 149 playing cards capture apocalyptic events (7 seals, 7 trumpets, 7 vials), special powers (e.g. the Anitchrist, Gog of Magog, etc.), nuclear weapons (tactical, theatre, and strategic) and homeland populations. Battle dice are used to resolve all battles.&#10;&#10;Players maneuver their armies across the map and resolve battles using the battle dice. Event cards are drawn each turn, giving players special powers or weapons of mass destruction, but they can also bring on apocalyptic events. Ultimately, the player who best manages the chaos and controls Jerusalem at the end of the game wins!&#10;&#10;The Battle of Armageddon provides a simple but challenging game system suitable for both seasoned and casual players. Players are forced to adjust their strategy depending on rapidly changing conditions as dictated by the event cards. Combat is bloody, yet managed quickly and decisively through the battle dice. Players must manipulate allies and opponents to achieve the goal of capturing the Holy Land.&#10;&#10;Six battle games are included which allow 2-3 players to play an hour-long game.&#10;&#10;Product information:&#10;&#10;&#10;        Complexity: 5 out of 10&#10;        Solitaire Suitability: average&#10;        Time Scale: 1 Turn = 1 Week&#10;        Map Scale: 100 km per hex&#10;        Unit Scale: armies of varied size&#10;        Players: 2 to 6 players&#10;        Playing Time: 2 to 4 hours&#10;&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;&#10;        one MOUNTED 19&Prime; x 33&Prime; game board&#10;        216 large counters (5/8&Prime; playing pieces)&#10;        149 playing cards&#10;        Rules booklet&#10;        6 scenarios and a Campaign Game&#10;        four battle dice (1 blue, 3 white)&#10;        Game box&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Credits:&#10;&#10;&#10;        Designer: Kerry Anderson&#10;        Artist: Nadir Elfarra&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "From Khyber Pass Games website&#10; George Armstrong Custer and The Battle of the Little Bighorn have long overshadowed the Battle of the Rosebud.  Preceding the Little Bighorn by a week, the outcome of this battle directly influenced what happened to Custer and the 7th US Cavalry.&#10; General George Crook was given command of the Southern column of the Bighorn Campaign.  With Gibbon's column coming in from the West and the Terry/Custer column from the Northeast, the campaign's objective was to trap the Sioux and Northern Cheyenne and forcibly return them back to their reservation.&#10; Tactically the battle was inconclusive.  Casualties on both sides were relatively low, and in the end Crook held the field.  But strategically the Rosebud fight was a great victory for the Sioux and Cheyenne.  Crook expended a huge amount of ammunition; most soldiers were down to 10 rounds or fewer each.  Many horses were killed, injured, or worn out. Because of these reasons Crook decided to withdraw his command back to his base camp, effectively taking his column out of the campaign.&#10; Had Crook been able to continue operations he could have linked up with Custer's column, adding his infantry and cavalry to the 7th Cavalry.  Custer's last stand would have, in all probability, never have occurred.&#10; Game scale:&#10;Each combat unit represents:&#10; - one US Cavalry company&#10; - approximately 100 Indians&#10; - individual leader&#10;Each hex equals 1/4 mile across.&#10;Each game turn represents 20 minutes.&#10;&#10;This game will be re-released by Legion Wargames as a boxed game with die-cut EasyPunch counters.

    "description": "The Battle of Vimy Ridge, April 9th to April 12th, 1917, was part of the Battle of Arras in north-eastern France and took place during World War One. It was the first time that the four Divisions of the Canadian Corps fought together as one and is arguably Canada&rsquo;s most celebrated military victory. The Ridge itself was a crucial strategic location and previous attempts by the British and French to take it had failed. New tactics for assaulting trenches were employed, where enemy units were pinned and suppressed with machine gun fire and other weapons before infantry ran in with bayonets to finish the job. Soldiers were given more flexibility to make decisions &lsquo;on the fly&rsquo; supported by non-commissioned officers as the battle developed or in situations where officers had been lost to enemy fire. In addition, troops were allocated specific roles, for example as specialist grenade throwers. In addition, the Canadian forces were advancing behind a rolling barrage of artillery fire which caused German soldiers to run for cover into underground chambers to avoid annihilation. This helped the Canadians to enter the trenches before the enemy could recover and reinforce. The Ridge was taken, and the battle was over in four days.&#10;&#10;In the game, the Player will take control of a Sergeant who finds himself as the highest ranking soldier amongst a selection of various units, representing small groups of remaining men in rifle squads, grenade squads and machine gun teams, seeking to achieve various Objectives. The exploits of each of the four Divisions of the Canadian Corps is represented by three connected mission maps, giving twelve mission maps in total. The game should be played as four distinct campaigns consisting of the three mission maps for each Division.&#10;&#10;The aim of this book is to present a clear, accessible, and quick to learn game, so that players can get into the action quickly. It does not claim to be entirely realistic, but the game mechanics do represent the historical characteristics of the assault as set out above. Each of the 12 mission maps should provide plenty of replayability due to the random set up of the initial forces and the outcome of the many action points in the game.&#10;&#10;This book is a solitaire wargame. You play the game, and the enemy is controlled by the game book (or the Artificial Intelligence or &lsquo;AI&rsquo;). You will probably need around a dozen or so standard six-sided dice, although this will vary a little depending on what exactly happens in the game, and the number of dice needed can easily be reduced simply by rolling fewer dice several times as required.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from designer&#10;&#10;",

The city's ports are filled with rugged individuals prepared for the difficult tasks ahead. Gather the crew, board the schooners, cast your nets, and catch loads of fish as you sail toward victory.&#10;&#10;The two-player game Fisheries of Gloucester lasts six &quot;days&quot; (rounds). On each day, players have a designated number of hours to spend to perform various actions, such as charting the course, sailing your boats, and catching fish. Each player has a fleet of three boats that can be advanced by first &quot;charting a course&quot; (laying down an ocean tile, which have various polynomial shapes). With courses set, players can move their boats along the course, racing against other boats to find the prime fishing spots.&#10;&#10;Players earn points by catching different varieties of fish and by finishing the game on one of the islands in the ocean.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "&quot;Iliad: The Siege of Troy&quot; is a wargame of single combat...between the Gods and Heroes of ancient Greece and Troy.  To the mundane scholars of academe, the Trojan War was fought for control of the ancient Black Sea trade routes.  To the Romantic, it was fought over Helen of Troy, 'the face that launched a thousand ships and burned the topless towers of Ilium.' Whatever the cause, romantic or commercial, the war raged ten long years and involved the greatest warriors of that ancient age.  Behind them stood the Olympian gods who, although forbidden by Zeus from intervening decisively, nevertheless gave what help they could to the side they favored.  The Iliad is a fast-moving game of the entire ten-year war which has formed the basis for Homer's epic Iliad.  Features include:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Every important Greek and Trojan hero is individually represented&#10;     Heroes face each other in single combat as they vie for superiority&#10;     Olympian gods may receive appeals and aid their chosen heroes&#10;     Special rules cover the quarrel between Agamemnon and Achilles: if the quarrel is set aside, Achilles joins the battle, much to the dismay of the Trojans.&#10;&#10;&#10;Outside references:&#10;&#10;&quot;Players Notes&quot; by S.

This mode is a good starting point if you&rsquo;re trying to learn the game by yourself.&#10;     Versus: A fierce head-to-head in which one player pitches the British forces against the other player&rsquo;s American troops.&#10;     Co-op mode: In this cooperative mode all players share the same objective: take on the role of the American colonists to win Independence from the British.&#10;     Traitor Mode: The inclusion of a secret traitor who will try to thwart the Americans&rsquo; efforts adds a devious twist to the co-op mode.&#10;     Mastermind: As one player assumes the role of George III the Sons of Liberty will have to band together to overcome the British King&rsquo;s formidable forces.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "(from the back of the box:)&#10;&#10;War in Europe is the largest single strategy game ever professionally published. This update of the revered SPI &quot;monster&quot; game is a simulation of World War II at the division/corps level. There are nine 22&quot; x 34&quot; map sections covering an area from the North Cape of Norway to the deserts of Libya and the Middle East and from the British Isles to the city of Stalingrad. Each hex represents 33 kilometers of ground and each Game Turn represents one week of actual time.&#10;&#10;War in Europe's most striking feature is the map. Over 25 countries are delineated with their industrial and resource centers, major and minor ports, significant cities, rivers and other fascinating geographic features. All of this has been beautifully rendered using satellite photography and state of the art graphic design techniques.&#10;&#10;The rules have been painstakingly updated and many new optional rules and variants are featured along with carefully revised charts and tables. In addition to War in Europe's original 3600 die-cut counters, representing the armed forces of over 20 nations, there are 480 new counters in this updated edition (optional units that might have been assembled to allow exploration of some historical &quot;what ifs?&quot;) . You'll be campaigning with artillery units for all sides, German motorized units, U.S. Marines, additional Soviet Guard Tank and Mechanized units, and more French armored should you decide to build them using the game's fascinating production system.&#10;&#10;All sides must manage their own war economies. Players must make choices within certain broad limits what combat units to build. For example, you must choose whether to build relatively expensive strategic units such as Air Points, Airborne capability, U-boats, Strategic Bombers, Naval units, or the more common ground combat units like infantry and armor. The routine of production is executed every four Game Turns (weeks) during a &quot;Strategic Cycle&quot; that also features Reinforcement, the U-boat War, and Strategic Bombing.&#10;&#10;Although War in Europe is a big game, its complexity is not high. It can easily be played solitaire, but is most enjoyable with two or three players or teams. Players represent the leadership of the Western Allies (Commonwealth and USA), the German-dominated Axis, or the Soviet Union. Play moves back and forth over the map for nearly six years in the full Campaign Game (or for less time in the numerous scenarios provided), as the fortunes of the Axis Player rise and fall in the face of the increasing Allied and Soviet strength.&#10;&#10;War in Europe also features numerous Campaign Scenarios that pick up play at historic watersheds like D-Day or the start of Barbarossa. There are even more abbreviated games in the form of limited historical scenarios using just one to four maps. These dispense with the Strategic cycle in its entirety and simulate the major events of the war, such as the Fall of France, the Invasion of Italy, or the Stalingrad Campaign. Physically, they are much easier to play than a full campaign and are complete games within themselves. Players may also focus on just the Eastern or Western Front for individual scenarios as well as the whole war.&#10;&#10;A three-cornered diplomatic situation also arises from the strategic situation. While early on the Allies and Soviets share the common goal of defeating the Axis, as Germany's defeat becomes more certain there is less ground for cooperation and more chance of their alliances falling apart. Victory is determined by the relative territorial stance of the Players at game's end so, ultimately, it's an every-man-for-himself game.&#10;&#10;So, it's back, and better than ever. War in Europe is not just for collectors anymore. This second edition version is for you, the strategy game lover who wants to fight &quot;The Big One&quot; with The Big One of gaming.&#10;&#10;War in Europe: it's not just for collectors anymore.&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;&#10;    4080 backprinted, full color die cut counters&#10;    3 Production Displays&#10;    3 Reinforcement &amp; Air Displays&#10;    3 Player Aid Charts &amp; Tables&#10;    2 48 page Rulebook&#10;    9 34&quot; x 22&quot; full color maps&#10;    2 dice &amp; Storage bags&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Fast-paced family game by Reiner Knizia, set in Greg Stafford's world of Glorantha. Players are khans of different fantastical tribes on the Plains of Prax, each riding a unique animal that confers special abilities. Everyone attempts to amass the biggest herd, meanwhile fighting off enemy magic, stampedes and attempts by other players to steal their cows.&#10;&#10;Each player chooses a Khan to play, and receives a set number of corral tiles (depending on the number of players in the game). Each Khan has a different special ability. For example, the Morokanth player gets one extra Corral tile, and the High Llama player can sneak one cow card into each of their corrals after the gate has been closed.&#10;&#10;Players take turns to raid different locations, drawing cards from 10 different stacks. Each stack contains the cards, in random order: 1 x 100, 2 x 50 and 1 x 20 Cows, a Stampede card (discard highest value cow card), an Enemy Magic card (discard all cow cards), a Tribal Champion card (protects against Enemy Magic), and a Waha's Blessing card worth 20 cows, which a player can swap for another player's Cow card.&#10;&#10;Each players' cow cards are placed face-up in front them as their herd. Instead of drawing, on their turn a player can corral their cows. Corralled cows are safe, but each corral can only be opened once in a game. Uncorraled cows count towards the final score at the end of the game, but remain at risk of Stampedes, Enemy Magic and Waha's Blessings. Because each player has a limited number of corrals, a key element of the game is deciding when to corral them. The player with the most cows&mdash;including those in corrals and in their herd&mdash;at the end of the game is the winner and acclaimed &quot;Khan of Khans&quot;.&#10;&#10;",

This gets more and more difficult as the winter swiftly approaches. And on top of all that, there&rsquo;s this big terrifying polar bear&hellip;&#10;&#10;The game uses an innovative worker placement mechanism combined with resource management and a bit of bluffing. It uses dice in a few interesting ways but none of them require you to roll them. ;-)&#10;&#10;&#10;GAMEPLAY&#10;&#10;Every round players build a new landscape out of the 6 double sided land cards. As they do, they place their two camps along the way. Numbers on the chosen land cards determine the player order for the next round.&#10;&#10;Every land card is divided in half, so you do not choose a single card, but you have to combine two of them to form the complete location for your camp.&#10;&#10;At the start of the round, players secretly send their polar bear to one of the land cards and since you try to avoid the bear and want to get the best card at the same time, it brings a small bluffing aspect to the game.&#10;&#10;After completing the landscape, players resolve their camps. One of the camps serve as a &quot;day camp&quot; and the other as a &quot;night camp&quot; and each of them has a bit different purpose.&#10;&#10;While resolving a camp you can use all the resources shown on its location, but you have to fit them into your inventory to be able to use them later in the game. You can even build useful tools, but they take up space in your inventory as well. &#10; Scoring is resolved every round in your night camp and consists of feeding your Inuit and keeping him warm.&#10;&#10;The land cards serve also as a timer. One of them is flipped &quot;winter&quot; side up every round and the game ends when all the land cards get flipped.&#10;&#10;&#10;The game was designed for the 2017 9-Card Nanogame P&amp;P Design Contest and it achieved the following awards:&#10;&#10;1st place - Best Overall Game&#10;&#10;1st Place - Best 2 player Game&#10;1st place - Best Thematic Game&#10;1st place - Best Written Rules&#10;1st place - Best Artwork&#10;2nd place - Most Innovative Mechanic&#10;&#10;",

Protect your cars with various insurance and 'force' opponents to run into bad luck.&#10;&#10;Each player owns a car dealership, and is trying to have the greatest value in cash and vehicle inventory when the game ends. Everyone starts out with several cars, an insurance policy (for things like theft, fire, etc), and several Dealer's Choice cards. These cards can be used for individual benefit (e.g. selling a car for list price, buy a new car for $200, etc), or they can be more insidious, such as stealing the car of someone else or setting their car on fire. A word of warning...don't play with anyone that doesn't like you! They could make your life miserable with bad Dealer's Choice cards. As the game progresses, each player buys and sells based on their unique &quot;Blue Book&quot;, which shows values for each car. These values are different for every player, so what is worth $10,000 to the seller could be junk to someone else. Obviously, everyone is trying to buy low and sell high. That is the basic idea of the game...here are a few tips!&#10;-Play with the max amount of players. Only playing with two or three people is no fun.&#10;-If you have dealer's choice cards to sell for blue book or list price, and you have a valuable car, cash in on it before someone steals it or otherwise takes it from you.&#10;-One disadvantage is near the end of the game, when all the cars are on the lots. Everyone has seen all the cars, so each round becomes redundant. It ends up being the same cars, same prices, and the same obstinate sellers. To get past this roadblock, you often have to sell some cars cheaper than you would otherwise, just to bring closure to the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Guerra De Mitos III is a card game set in a fantastic world where different mythologies coexist. It is a different, dynamic game designed to be able to build different decks with very distinct and varied strategies, and each installment increases both the number of available mythologies and the game possibilities.&#10;&#10;The game contains 150 cards split between the Egypt mythology and reinforcements for GDM I and GDM II. Egypt mythology includes 2 pantheons (cards that define your game strategy) + 33 cards for the gods deck (which includes characters, events and resources) + 40 cards for the designs deck (actions, equipment and summonings).&#10;&#10;Each player in War of the Myths III needs to build his own deck of at least 51 cards (1 pantheon / 20 gods / 30 designs) of his choice, and each installment increases the diversity of characters, actions and strategies you can use in order to achieve victory.&#10;&#10;Each player has to bring into play the cards his oracles offer him and play actions from the designs deck both in the influence phase (where the gods plan from their pantheon) and in the confrontation phase (where the characters who decide to go to battle fight to decrease the opponent&rsquo;s power) to obtain supremacy or consign the opponent to oblivion.&#10;&#10;",
