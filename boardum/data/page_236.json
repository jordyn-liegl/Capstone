The other players watch his groping through a clear opening in the dome.  A card is collected only when the last piece is drawn.  Points are awarded for pieces drawn and cards collected with a bonus for having a complete set.&#10;&#10;",

A circle of 19 cards is placed face up and the remaining 9 are placed face down as a draw pile. Once players have had a chance to memorise the circle, all cards are placed face down. Players then take turns turning one card in the circle face up and moving the bird pawn that many spaces clockwise. If they land on a face down hippo they are safe and score one point for every face up hippo they passed. If they land on a face up hippo they take the card as a penalty (-2 points at the end of the game) and replace it from the draw pile. Instead of choosing a card from the circle, players may discard any other player's penalty card and move that many spaces.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the draw pile is empty.

However, things are never simple when you travel and you may well encounter road blocks or be affected by chance. Chance cards can send you in entirely the opposite direction - to Minsk, for example, when you are hoping to get to Dublin - but they can also give you a free airline ticket or allow you to send another player to somewhere like Kishinev.

But getting the respect of the dwarves, who are small but proud, is not a simple matter. You need to be a good gold prospector but also an honoured beer brewer!&#10;&#10;After a preliminary placement phase during which the pieces are set up on the game board representing Skaaland (with its regions and villages), each player tries to win respect points.&#10;&#10;Each turn, each player may only carry out one of the six available actions. Players can bring new dwarves into the game, move those already on the board, prospect in search of gold, mine discovered gold, open a tavern or move a tavern.&#10;&#10;The problem with dwarves is that they're sometimes a little impetuous. For example, if a player discovers gold in a region, a rumour of its discovery immediately propagates across the land and the dwarves from the neighbouring regions arrive at top speed to see the new discovery. Not a moment's peace!&#10;&#10;Sometimes, while prospecting, a player runs into &quot;oops&quot; instead. That's annoying because the effort was wasted, and it means that there will never be any gold in that region.&#10;&#10;But gold isn't the only thing that matters in life! Digging is thirsty work and if a clan has a majority in a region, it may open a tavern. If the dwarves are too drunk to dig, then the clan that owns the tavern gains, each turn, respect points equal to the number of dwarves from opposing clans around the tavern. And that's good!&#10;&#10;The drunk dwarves either flee this village of debauchery, or return with their buddies and take over the den of iniquity.&#10;&#10;Contents: 1 rules insert, 1 game board, 90 dwarf figures, 12 tavern markers, 1 sack of 'gold', 1 sack of 'oops', 1 prospecting pawn, 1 special die.&#10;&#10;This game is the 3rd in the Tilsit Collection series.&#10;&#10;",

Imagine yourself as one of these mages, dwelling in a mystical bastion with your allies and servants, unlocking secret powers and creating wonders. Every thirty-three years the Grand Tribunal is held, attracting other wizards from far and wide to show off their magical creations for the inspection and approval of the archmages. These powerful judges vote on the best, and invite the winner to join their ranks as a new archmage -- a true master of the art of magic!&#10;&#10;Grand Tribunal is a board game for three to five players, inspired by the Ars Magica roleplaying game. In Grand Tribunal, players use Vis tokens to activate cards representing magic item types, spell categories, and resources, which they then assemble into powerful magic items. Each round, players place their votes for the item types and spell categories they're most likely to be able to play. Three times during the game -- at the periodic Tribunals -- players are presented with 1st-, 2nd-, and 3rd-place awards for creating magic items with item types and spell categories that match those with the most votes. The player at the end of the game with the most points based on those awards wins!&#10;&#10;",

If someone collects a shell card that is worth points, that player places the card on the table; if the shell card features a starfish, every player passes one beach card left or right as instructed.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player has no cards left in hand or has only the sea monster in hand.

Each robot is represented by a composite miniature that you put together using the available components. There are two different command units (heads), two main thrusters (bottoms), and four equipment tenders (middle pieces with six slots in them), with which you can make Scouts (combots with one tender), Warriors (two tenders), or Marauders (three tenders), although you don't get enough tenders with the game to build a pair of Marauders.&#10;&#10;Now comes the fun part. Not only can you custom-design your combots, you can actually build them by sliding various modules into the slots in the equipment tenders: claw arms, lasers, laser shields, aiming units, missile launchers, armor plates, etc., etc. When you're ready, deploy your combots at either end of the included diamond-shaped hex map and guide them into battle; the last robot with any remaining functional offensive modules wins.&#10;&#10;Approximate playing time is a guess. Two players is the maximum for a standard game; scenarios are provided that allow up to five players to play in the diamond map, or more players in user-designed maps, but you would have to buy either extra copies of the game or components for additional miniatures.&#10;&#10;",

Each player places a color card down as their marker and the matching sets of cards numbered 1-12 in those colors make up the deck. The deck is shuffled and players get 4 cards, the remainder goes down as a draw deck. There is a set of small tiles in red and black for negative or positive points (red are 4,4,5,5,6,6, black are 2,3,3,4,4,4,5,5,5,6,6,6). These are shuffled face down and 4 turned up to start 4 rows.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you can place a card against a row or try to swap a card with another player. If you want to swap, you simply offer a color for another color, mentioning no numbers. Swap with the player of your choice, but if nobody wants to swap, you've wasted your turn.&#10;&#10;When you play a card to a row, you draw back so you have 4 cards. When the row is full, determined by the number on the tile, the player with the highest total in the cards has to take the tile, be it positive or negative. Usually your choices are obvious, but sometimes it is worth assisting another player to take a row, rather than waste a good card for you on a low or negative tile. If a row is tied between players, the cards are discarded and the tile stays for more cards.&#10;&#10;The discard deck is shuffled over, taken tiles refreshed by new ones. The game ends when the tiles are all taken, deduct the negative from the positive to get your score.&#10;&#10;This game was re-themed and expanded on with Relikt.&#10;&#10;",

Players place one of their cards in front of themselves, and this continues until the hand ends.

The Gorgangrackles eat the Anglerfin. The Anglerfin eat the Chumtails. The Chumtails eat the Trollsharks. The Trollsharks...well they eat each other. Between the moistened mountains of Bluff and Butte sprawl the villages of the Nautilus, a peculiar race of tentacle-bearded nature-lovers. The villages are said to reside on top of a rare mineral deposit of UnderAether.&#10;&#10;Topside a Cog would give his left leg for a small glimpse of the material. The UnderAether could supply their steam-factories for centuries and here it is resting under the tentacles of water breathers. The Rivalry has been fought for years. Now the famous Gearhead's Brigade has been sent by the High Cog Warden to investigate a strange beacon in the deep dark depths.&#10;&#10;Rivals: Masters of the Deep is a tactical game for two or more players set in the cold dark depths of the Lurk. Players take command of either the Cog or the Nautilus, gather a fighting force and, through wise decisions and strategic moves, destroy the opposition. In Rivals, Cog &amp; Nautilus go head to head on the battlefield. Your team will engage in fast-paced combat and interact with the board itself. The Creatures of the Lurk will come out of hiding, coral will try and eat you, Underwater rip tides will batter you, all as you fend off your opponent.&#10;&#10;To Setup your game you first gather your army by spending Aether. Each model has a cost. You then pay for any abilities or starting equipment you would like your army to have. You then create the &quot;Lurk&quot; Map. The Lurk is where all battles in the base game play out. The Lurk map is made with hex tiles. After setting up the map, including all card decks and dice, you place your units in the starting points. Your teams are now ready to do battle.&#10;&#10;There are two phases for each side, a Movement Phase &amp; an Action Phase. During the Movement phase you may activate up to two hexes worth of models to begin their movement. After all movement is completed the player moves on to the Action phase. Like the movement phase you may activate up to two hexes, same or different, to begin their Actions. In the Action phase each activated model can perform one of four actions or a special action. The basic actions are Attack, Search, Recover or Charge. There are special areas on the map that you can search and explore but be wary because there is usually danger in dark places. The map also contains dangers and difficult terrain including Coral, underwater geysers and much more.&#10;&#10;Turns go back and forth until your opponents hero is destroyed.&#10;&#10;",

They then attempt to mislead the greatest number of other players, who are cloud hunters, in an effort to gain points. To do this, after choosing a card, the visionary makes up a story of at most five words, then splays the cards on the table, and the cloud hunters in turn attempt to guess the visionary's chosen cloud. If the hunters choose a card that's not correct, the chosen card is given to the visionary, and play passes to the next hunter. If the chosen card is correct, the visionary earns points for every card they've already gathered.&#10;&#10;After a set amount of turns, where each player gets a chance to be a visionary, play concludes, and the player with the most points wins!&#10;&#10;",

Each card is unique because in addition to the cop, they each have a diffrent symbol on them, i.e. a Tree, a Stop Sign, etc. Now put them in a circle with their feet toward the inside of the circle. Further, you also have a deck of 21 Direction cards and each has a symbol (which corresponds to the ones on the Traffic Cop cards) and 3 directions on them, i.e. A Tree, 4 Rights, 3 Lefts, 2 Lefts. This Direction deck is placed face down in the center of the circle. Anyone flips a direction card and it all starts; start at the Traffic Cop that has the matching symbol, then move left and right as the card calls for, but remember you must move to the Traffic Cop's left or right. So depending on if they are facing forward or backwards, you go the appropriate direction. Whoever calls out the correct stopping place first, by symbol, wins the card. Good game similar to Ikarus.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Toppling the Reich: The Battles for the Westwall, is an operational level simulation of the fighting for the Rhine River and Westwall that occurred in 1944 and 1945. Designer John Prados transports his Panzerkrieg game system to the Western Front to examine the major episodes of this clash. Using scenarios, which can also be linked together to form a campaign game, he covers the entire war in France and the Low Countries from early September 1944 to the German surrender in May 1945. Players on both sides will be challenged with conducting offensive operations as well as desperate defenses.&#10;&#10;Units are mostly divisions with some specialist brigades/regiments (engineers, commandos, heavy or specialized armor units). Players can form larger Corps level formations that enhance combat actions. The air war is also covered with air units on both sides conducting air superiority, ground support, parachute and aerial supply missions. The game design is easy to get into, but loaded with much decision-making for both players. The level of supply and logistical support determines how many units and leaders can conduct operations in the turn. Leadership on both sides, in the form of the various Army and Front Headquarters as well as the leaders from each, play vital roles in the various operations each turn. While the Allies can field a tremendous force across the entire front, the lack of ports and the Allied ever-lengthening supply lines will be a challenge in keeping the offensive moving. The German player will have less of a challenge in providing logistical support, but his already battered Wehrmacht, Luftwaffe and SS formations will face a hard time in fending off the enemy&rsquo;s attacks while also gathering strength and resources for a counter-strike. Timing, planning, and making the most of the opportunities presented to you on the battlefield are key to success in this game by award-winning designer, John Prados.&#10;&#10;Rules in Toppling the Reich include ones dealing with the various Army and Corps Commanders on both sides, Paratroop drops and airpower, a very clever depiction of ULTRA capabilities (and failures), the planning and timing for German counter-attacks. Toppling the Reich is actually six different games: five scenarios which cover the Western Front from September 1944 to April 1945 and one 36 turn Campaign Game which includes this entire period. The smaller scenarios include:&#10;&#10;Scenario 1: Broad Front or Narrow Thrust? (Market-Garden) - Sept. 1-24, 1944 (four turns)&#10;Having broken out of Normandy, Allied troops capture Paris and press toward the German frontier. The Germans strive to rebuild the strength of their Fifth Panzer Army, destroyed in the Falaise Pocket, and to reconstitute a solid defense. The Allied commander has a very limited attack supply capability and must choose between attacking all along the front or concentrating for a single powerful attack.&#10;&#10;Scenario 2: See Germany and Die! Closing Up to the Westwall - Sept. 25-Nov. 11, 1944 (8 turns)&#10;Against a rapidly solidifying German defense, Allied armies attempt to maximize their gains in spite of their still limited supply abilities. The full deployment of the Allied Sixth Army Group north of the Swiss border and the continued offensive stance of Patton&rsquo;s Third Army press the Germans in Lorraine back towards the Rhine. At the same time, the Americans in the center take Aachen while the British attain the line of the Meuse.&#10;&#10;Scenario 3: The Roer River and Lorraine - Nov. 12-Dec. 10, 1944 (5 turns)&#10;Greatly recovered from its Normandy debacle, the German army by November 1944 is offering stiff resistance to the Allies. For their part, Allied armies attempt to clear the right bank of the Rhine in Lorraine, and to expand and secure their penetration of the Westwall at Aachen. This stage of the war sees some of the most bitter and bloody fighting in the Western Front.&#10;&#10;Scenario 4: Herbstnebel-Nordwind: From the Bulge to Alsace - Dec. 11, 1944-Feb. 2, 1945 (9 turns)&#10;The Allied advance has been essentially brought to a halt before the Westwall. The German High Command made a conscious decision about their strategy for the next phase of the campaign. Adolf Hitler opts for a counter-offensive, and attacks are planned in the Ardennes and toward Strassbourg. The Germans throw their best forces into a last great gamble to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat.&#10;&#10;Scenario 5: The Defense of the Rhine - Feb. 4-Apr. 3, 1945 (10 turns)&#10;After the failure of the Bulge and Alsace offensives, an exhausted German army returns to the Westwall to discover that the Allies are already prepared for a bone-shattering frontal offensive. Allied troops grind through the Westwall defenses and the Germans attempt to hold the Rhine. Hitler, dissatisfied with the situation in the West, relieves his best commanders. With the end of the war nearing, an important question for the Allied Command is what kind of attack force should be brought to bear against Berlin.&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;&#10;    One 22 x 34&quot; full color map&#10;    Two dual-side printed countersheets (480 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;    One 20-page Toppling the Reich rulebook&#10;    One dual-side printed Toppling the Reich Special Rules Player Aid&#10;    Two single-side printed set-up Player Aid charts&#10;    Three dual-side printed 11x17&quot; scenario set-up sheets&#10;    Two 6-sided dice&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;&#10;    Game Turn: 6 days&#10;    Hex: 5 miles / 8 kilometers&#10;    Units: Battalion to Corps&#10;&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: Medium&#10;Complexity Level: Medium&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 2-15 hours&#10;&#10;",

You need to gather expeditions of crews, supplies and equipment and face many pitfalls.&#10;&#10;The game plays in two phases, before and after the ship is raised (more on this later).  In the first phase, you circle the outer board gathering your expeditions, and occasionally enter the two inner paths that actually lead to the ship.  This is where you plun...er, &quot;recover artifacts&quot; from the Titanic.  After the ship is raised, the game now becomes a race to the Home Port with the ship's log.  All players get an advance from the publisher and the race proceeds.  The player with the log rolls only one die to the others' two, and the log changes hands each time the player with the log is caught up with.&#10;&#10;Winner is the player with the most money from artifacts recovered, fame points garnered and the ship's log bonus.&#10;&#10;The board is centered on a plastic column with a spring inside; a large model of the Titanic rests on the spring, loaded down by the weighted artifacts.  As the latter are recovered, the model naturally climbs up towards the top of the column.  Simple, clever and visually quite effective.&#10;&#10;",

Let's say a controversial Issue comes up that is worth negative points. After all, there are some topics that no matter what you say, you're going to lose voters. Wouldn't it be handy if one of your opponents gave a Good Speech on the issue?&#10;&#10;Each player is given a Candidate card at the start of the game representing a well know political persona. &#10;Each Candidate card has a built in special ability and Favor points.&#10;&#10;A revolutionary part of the game design is the introduction of &quot;Favor&quot; points. Each player starts the game with a couple Favor chips, and players may trade them back and forth as they wish. There are no rules governing the trading of Favors. Here's the cool part, at the end of the game, every Favor that you have that came from another player counts as a Vote. Your own Favor chips do nothing for you at the end of the game!&#10;&#10;Wheel and deal! Gather political favors and be the power all others seek in desperate times, and at the end of the day, you'll be seated in the Oval Office!&#10;&#10;Some have said this seems to make the point that political favors are just as important as votes in American Politics.&#10;&#10;Is this a bad thing?

A mere five battalions, but the prime of the French army. Historically the Imperial Guard withdrew and the cry &quot;La Garde recule!&quot; sounded across the French Army.&#10;Will the French player succeed where Napoleon failed?&#10;&#10;&quot;La Garde recule!&quot; is a mini-game, postcard sized. Rules at the back, map front and 16 (mostly) double sided counters along the sides. &#10;The game is a hex and counter game where troops are activated though a standard deck of cards: black activates French units, red Allied. How many and all is determined by the specific card. &#10;Combat is resolved by comparing combat strengths of the units and drawing cards from that same deck. Whenever a joker is drawn, the turn is over, the deck is reshuffled and a new turn begins.&#10;&#10;Goal of the game is to get the French units off the north side of the map (breaking through Allied lines at Waterloo) while the Allies win by preventing that.&#10;&#10;",

Each aspect of the game is multi-layered.  In addition, you can mix and match the cards in the box to design your own decks and take control of your own ApocalypZe.&#10;&#10;Your deck of cards represents your supplies and resources during these trying times. During the game you will consume these resources and do your best to replenish them while trying to force your opponent to waste through his own. Once you run out of supplies, you no longer have the capacity to survive and are out of the game.&#10;&#10;During each turn you play cards to one location on the table. This may be your stronghold or your opponent's. It may also be another type of location such as a scavenging location. You must choose your location carefully each turn. If you choose to act against an opponent, you will not be able to sure up your defenses.&#10;&#10;Throughout the course of the game you be able to defend your stronghold and scavenge for resources with survivors, and attack your opponent's stronghold and scavenging locations with zombies and other raiders. A number of types of cards that both enhance your characters and affect the game in various ways can be played throughout the course of your turn.&#10;&#10;As the game progresses, you will be forced to consume resources (cards). As your deck dwindles, you will have to make some hard choices to insure that you will outlast your opponent and survive the ApocalypZe.&#10;&#10;",
