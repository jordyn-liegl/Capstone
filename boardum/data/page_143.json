    "description": "Too Many Cooks is a co-operative hidden information card game about fussy chefs cooking soups together. It is played in 3 rounds of 5 minutes. You can play in one of 3 difficulty settings; easy, moderate &amp; hard, or you can play through all of them in an hour long session.&#10;&#10;You are chefs working together on a delicious soup that satisfies shared culinary tastes. The catch is, each chef has secret personal tastes which must also be sated!&#10;&#10;The game starts with a soup base of 16 vegetable card ingredients laid out on the table. Rising to the challenge, players take it in turns to change or move the soup ingredients to satisfy as many tastes as possible before the time runs out.&#10;&#10;On your turn you may either: &#10;Change just one aspect of a card - ie its vegetable or colour, by swapping it out for a spare card.&#10;or &#10;Rotate a row or column of vegetables 1 card in either direction.&#10;or &#10;Pass - if your personal tastes and all shared tastes are satisfied.&#10;&#10;Of course changes to the soup may upset or satisfy other chef&rsquo;s secret taste sensibilities too! So, players vocalise their satisfaction or dissatisfaction and rotate their taste cards in hand to indicate how happy or unhappy they are after each change to the soup. But they cannot say exactly why. Eg &ldquo;Ewwww, that&rsquo;s disgusting!&rdquo; is fine, but not &ldquo;Ewww, I hate mushrooms!&rdquo; Watch what other chefs seem to be working towards, and try to make changes that make everyone as happy as possible.&#10;&#10;Play fast to get your soup kitchen up to a 5 star rating over 3 rounds at your chosen difficulty level. Each of the 3 rounds gets a little harder starting with 7 tastes to solve, moving on to 9, and ending at 11 tastes divided between the players as secret personal tastes (2 each max, or 3 each in the 2 player game) with leftovers placed face up as shared tastes all chefs can work towards together.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The same rule applies when removing a stone - the logic is the same.&#10;&#10;The &quot;Old Stone&quot; is unique.

Movement consists of either &#10;a) a straight pass flight (no altitude change)&#10;b) a climb (increasing the height of the piece by adding an additional ring) or &#10;c) a dive (losing height to make a sequence of moves by removing one ring per descent height). &#10;Pieces are captured when they are in the line of fire of two or more enemy planes. Clouds block line of fire and provide strategic cover during play.&#10;&#10;If a player is reduced to having only one plane, he's shot from the sky (i.e., is eliminated from the game). A player wins when he reduces the only remaining opponent to only one plane. Games are brutal, fast, and fun.&#10;&#10;The base game includes components for a 2-player game.

    "description": "Orange Swan is a strategic game that recreates the war in the Pacific. Orange Swan may be combined with Black Swan and Orange Swan: Dai T&#197;&#141;-A Sens&#197;&#141; or both!&#10;&#10;The Call of The Orange Swan&#10;&#10;Japan, on the eve of its entry into World War Two, is looking in two different directions. It sees opportunity and it fears defeat. It clamours for modernity and yet it will not, cannot, forsake a history of staid traditions and the rituals of self-slaughter.&#10;&#10;Admiral Yamamoto, at the head of a powerful navy, is being driven towards a decision that is not of his making. Those who truly desire war will relinquish neither their swords nor the ethos with which they are imbued, and so even while the likes of Hideki Tojo make their case for the fulfilment of destiny, for the acquisition of empire and the control of an abundance of natural resources, Yamamoto is painfully aware that their contempt for any and all likely enemies, their belief in the cult of the warrior, their very dreams of battle and conquest, belong to an age that is already dead.&#10;&#10;Yamamoto sees only one chance &ndash; Japan must strike quickly and with overwhelming and decisive force. If the enemy, first and foremost the United States, is given any pause, any form of reprieve, Japan will almost certainly be crushed.&#10;&#10;Chance and mischance play out their themes at Pearl Harbor. Japan wins and loses all in the same instant. The US carriers are not there, and while Japan will conquer for a while, bringing much of the Pacific and SE Asia under its control, it cannot hold what it has gained. The oft-repeated commands to fight to the death are each an admission that they have already lost. It is only a matter of time&hellip;and of blood.&#10;&#10;The culmination is at Hiroshima. What good swords at such a time, against such a vast and blinding and terrible fire? Those who hungered for war have no answer. They have never had an answer. Science and industry do not sit well with emperor worship or with archaic notions of sacrifice.&#10;&#10;Could it have been different? Chance and mischance are the ultimate reality of every course that every war has ever followed. Orange Swan is your means to experience this.&#10;&#10;ORANGE SWAN is a block wargame covering WWII in the Pacific from 1941 to 1945.&#10;&#10;As in all other block games, both the Fog of War and Unit strength reduction/increase by rotation, drive the gameplay in ORANGE SWAN, as a player cannot know the identity or the strength of an enemy block until it is revealed in combat.&#10;&#10;ORANGE SWAN is a historical game with some fixed starting points, but the outcome is completely unpredictable and, despite the historical result, the Axis Side (Japan) can defeat the Allied Side (China, Commonwealth and US).&#10;&#10;During any Victory Check (two per each Season, one at the end of the Axis Turn and one at the end of the Allied Turn), the game immediately ends with a Total Victory if either the following conditions are met:&#10;&#10;a.    Tokyo is enemy Controlled;&#10;b.    Atomic Bomb Event;&#10;c.    Japan controls 7 Strategic Land Areas or Japan has a Production of 75.&#10;&#10;Additionally, a special Victory Check is made at the end of the each year of the Campaign game, or at the end of a Scenario.&#10;&#10;Game Introduction&#10;&#10;ORANGE SWAN is a historical game that covers WWII in the Pacific from 1941 to 1945. Its name reflects that of its older sibling Black Swan, a game that covers WWII&rsquo;s European Theatre, but also that of the United States&rsquo; plan for fighting Japan, developed long before Pearl Harbor, called War Plan Orange.&#10;&#10;Orange Swan uses many of the same game mechanics as Black Swan but with greater focus on the innovative, and mechanically simple, naval systems that were universally praised.&#10;&#10;One revision that entirely changes the feel of the game is the addition of the Seaborne Blitz phase. Similar to Black Swan&rsquo;s land based Blitz double turns that made the Eastern Front so dynamic, Orange Swan translates that idea to a double naval turn. The results are highly satisfying from both a gameplay and historical perspective.&#10;&#10;Similar to other block games, Fog of War is a core element in ORANGE SWAN, as a player cannot know the identity or the strength of an enemy unit until it is revealed in combat.&#10;&#10;While Orange Swan&rsquo;s campaigns and scenarios feature historical starting points, the outcome is completely unpredictable and, despite the historical result, the Axis Side (Japan) can defeat the Allied Side (the United States, the Commonwealth, and China).&#10;&#10;The Allied Side can cooperate, so they can stack together, or trace supply accross either a Sea Zone or a Land Area Controlled by an Allied Nation. (Note: Chinese Communists stack only with themselves).&#10;&#10;Japan, the United States (US), the Commonwealth (CW), and China are Major Nations. The Philippines and Dutch East Indies (DEI) are Minor Nations controlled by the US and CW respectively.&#10;&#10;No Side can enter Land Areas belonging to the Soviet Union or any of the Absolute Neutrals, identified with a white border: Nepal and Butan.&#10;&#10;Each Major Nation has its own units (in a specific color), Force Pool, Economic and Strategic Power.&#10;&#10;The Force Pool of a Nation is made up of all units of that Nation that are not deployed on the mapboard and are available to be built (that is, purchased during the Production Phase).  Note that some units have a colored circled number (2, 3, or 4) in one corner, indicating the year when the unit is added to the respective Force Pool. Thus, in 1943 it is not possible to build a Unit marked with a circled &ldquo;4&quot;, as it will be added to the proper Nation's Force Pool in Winter 1944. Elite Units are designated with a darker color background.&#10;&#10;Nations of the same Side maintain their own Supply Source (their National Capital) but they can trace Supply using any of their Side&rsquo;s Naval Units, Controlled Land Areas, or Controlled Sea Zones. They can freely enter any Land Area of, and be transported by, the Naval Units of their Side. They can stack, move, and attack together, but each Nation keeps its own Force Pool, Economic and Strategic Power.&#10;&#10;China has two kinds of forces: Nationalists and Communists. Both Chinese Nationalists and Chinese Communists are always supplied and therefore do not need to trace any supply.&#10;&#10;Chinese Communist Units can only stack with other Chinese Communists. They can, obviously, attack any Axis Side Units. Chinese Nationalists can stack (and move/attack) freely with units of the Allied Side.&#10;&#10;All Chinese units are restricted to Continental Asia and Hainan and can never be Sea Transported.&#10;&#10;National Capitals: Nations have the following Capitals, which also act as Supply Sources:&#10;&#10;1.       Japan: Tokyo&#10;2.       US: San Diego&#10;3.       CW: New Delhi and Sidney&#10;4.       Philippines: Manila&#10;5.       Dutch East Indies: Batavia&#10;&#10;Nation&rsquo;s have their own blocks of the following color:&#10;&#10;1.       Japan: orange&#10;2.       US: green&#10;3.       CW: blue&#10;4.       China: purple&#10;5.       Philippines: light green&#10;6.       Dutch East Indies (DEI): light blue&#10;&#10;Minor Nations do not have their own Economic or Strategic Power, nor a dedicated Force Pool. They are controlled by the Major Power they are allied to, which treats them as if they were CW (for the DEI) or US (for the Philippines) units for all game effects. When destroyed, Minor Nations units are eliminated from the game, so they will never go into any Force Pool.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;The Battle of Grunwald (15 July 1410) was one of the biggest, and most decisive, engagements of the middle ages. The myth of Teutonic invulnerability - already wobbly after the Battle on the Ice - was shattered by the combined might of Poland, Lithuania, and their allies. Though both sides fielded some infantry, and the Teutonic Order some cannon, cavalry predominated. The sudden withdrawal of the Lithuanian forces left the Poles vulnerable, and their dramatic re-entry onto the battlefield may have been decisive in turning the tide against the Germans. Poland is still immensely proud of their victory over six hundred years later, and the Germans were still feeling sore about it into the twentieth century.&#10;&#10;This first title in the revamped SHIELDS &amp; SWORDS II series lets two players refight this dynamic and exciting battle. With lots of horsies on both sides, it's a tense contest of maneuver and tempo. The Teutonic Player must protect his camp at all costs, and use every opportunity to slow the enemy's headlong advance. But blocking him here can open a hole over there - knowing where and when to leave a hole is key. His opponent must decide when to remove the Lithuanians from the battlefield, and when to bring them back on - there's a right time and wrong time for both, but in each case it's heavily contextual and dependent on the current game state, on his own strategy, and on his opponent's. The result is an unusually replayable medieval battle game that you, your friends, and your family can revisit again and again.&#10;&#10;The SHIELDS &amp; SWORDS II series builds on, and improves, the Shields &amp; Swords series of games (We Happy Few, Stamford Bridge, A Hill Near Hastings, and Our Royal Bones), with a greater variety of unit types, revised suppression rules, and a new D8-based CRT.&#10;&#10;",

In this solo game, you use the game board, a pencil, and a standard deck of playing cards to manage and advance the town and inhabitants of Copperdale. After twelve months (turns), you earn medals for the improvements you've made.&#10;&#10;Each month, one card at a time, you reveal and assign three cards from the top of the deck to the 1-ECONOMY, 2-INFRASTRUCTURE, and 3-GROWTH segments of the board, in any order you choose. Then, in the above order, you resolve those cards, filling in spaces based on the cards you assigned to each segment.&#10;&#10;Each card's suit and value matters, and depending on where you assign it, you fill in spaces on the board. Each space you fill hopefully leads to more medals at the end of the game. From learning occupations to expanding the city's borders, everything you do has the potential to unlock medals! However, with the design having slight rogue-like elements and a bit of press your luck, there's no guarantee you'll ever get the card you want &mdash; or that the next card you reveal will be better than the last.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

It postulates that this War in West Germany could occur without a massive strategic nuclear holocaust. Essentially, the game progresses from &quot;M,&quot; the day' the Warsaw Feet decides to launch an offensive, to day &quot;M + 50,&quot; when a decision of some type (even a stalemated war) is assumed to have been reached. The game may be played starting with &quot;M + 1,&quot; with the forces as they actually are in peacetime, or at &quot;M + 31,&quot; after both sides have reached planned strength.&#10;The increment of forces, as NATO transfers its scattered strength and Warsaw Pact sends forth additional member and Russian garrison divisions, is fully charted between the 'two game-versions. NATO depicts the essential elements of modern warfare (even Future warfare) with unusual elements such as Air-transportable units, Airmobile units and the newly proposed US Army Tricap (triple capability) divisions.&#10;&#10;Two basic scenarios (4 if nukes are used in two of them) and three variants (Warsaw Pact Unreliability, NATO Neutrality and Chinese Intervention).&#10;&#10;The map portrays Europe from East Germany to France and from Denmark to Switzerland.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 2 days&#10;Hex: 10 miles / 16 kilometers&#10;Units: Brigade to Division&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 22 x 34&quot; four color map&#10;One single-side printed countersheet (400 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 10-page rulebook&#10;One player aid fold-out sheet&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: High&#10;Complexity Level: Medium&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 4-15 hours&#10;&#10;",

In a turn the player pulls out a token from the bag, which defines how many tasks the player has to complete (either none, one or two). However, for a turn player has limited amount of time, which is kept hidden from him by another player.&#10;&#10;After pulling out a token the player draws the corresponding amount of cards and tries to complete the tasks depicted of them. There are many different tasks, for example, throwing the token in the air and catching it, or creating a tower from acrobats and so on. After player has completed the task(s) he can either end the turn and thus get the points, or try to get more points by pulling out a new token and then completing the tasks. However, if the player chooses to continue, he must complete the task before he can end the turn and this is the risk - if the time runs out while he is still performing the task, the turn ends immediately and the player doesn't receive any points this turn (any cards the player completed during this turn are put in the discard pile).&#10;&#10;The game ends after each player has had three turns and the winner is the one with most total points on his cards.&#10;&#10;",

Should the tile indicate an animal encounter, draw an animal card and place the corresponding animal token on the tile; if the tile indicates a forest fire or illegal logging, then forests might be destroyed.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Ranger Actions: There are five ranger actions that a player can choose from. The main action is to plant forests. Discard the required number of resource card and place the forest meeple on a tile. Planting trees give you victory points and upgrades your ranger skills. Other actions includes rescuing an animal, putting out a fire, swapping resource cards, and sending out rangers to protect your forest.&#10;&#10;&#10;Besides planting trees, players gain points when placing the wildlife in their proper habitats; also, putting out fire will produce victory points. The game ends once a player has planted all the forest meeple on their character boards.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

On your turn, you draw a card, place a piece of junk into play from your hand, and then activate one of the abilities on your junk or use your character's ability.&#10;&#10;All junk is worth something. In the Junkpile, there is one card that is the most coveted of items called The Crown. Once a player draws that card, the game is over and everyone adds up the points displayed on the pieces of junk they have found or hoarded. The player with the most points wins the current round. The game only takes about 15 minutes to play, and is designed for multiple rounds of play.&#10;&#10;",

Dubbed &ldquo;Case Yellow&rdquo; (Fall Gelb), it relied on a surprise attack with armored forces through the Ardennes Forest that the French had deemed impenetrable. A German staff study proved otherwise, and their panzers were pushed through this broken wooded terrain with deft speed, catching the Allies by surprise with their appearance.&#10;&#10;In No Retreat 3, players command the Allied (French and British) or German forces, operating them in accordance to one of several historical plans (represented by Plan cards). Maneuvering forces over hexes that are approximately 30 kilometers across, over turns that represent 4 days of real time each, the vaunted No Retreat series card-assisted game systems are there to create on-map puzzles around each hex, unit and battle as the tense engagements rage back-and-forth and nothing is entirely predictable.&#10;&#10;Designer Carl Paradis has made an exhaustive study to answer the question, &ldquo;Could France have staved off total defeat in 1940?&rdquo; His research yields a resounding, &ldquo;Yes!,&rdquo; and the simulation elements of &#3;No Retreat 3, combined with its novel gameplay elements, offer a rich and insightful presentation of this controversial military campaign that shaped the trajectory of World War II.&#10;&#10;Game Data:&#10;&#10;Complexity: 5 on a 9 scale&#10;Solitaire Suitability: 3 on a 9 scale&#10;Scale: Each unit is one army: The German forces or the Allied forces (French, British, and Neutrals) Each hex is about 30 kilometers from side to side.

Players are tasked with conservation efforts to repopulate coral as well as redevelop islands to make them conducive to animal life.&#10;&#10;&quot;Coral,&quot; designed by Richard Maass, sees players repopulate a shared coral reef using colourful translucent dice. Players take turns stacking dice on the board aiming to score points by completing structure cards that involve both their own dice and opponents' dice. In addition, players earn tokens representing the fish that live in the reef, which allow them to manipulate their dice or even place two dice on the same turn, generating engaging tactical and strategic tradeoffs between pursuing low-scoring easy-to-complete structure or high-scoring complex structures more likely to get blocked by an opponent, and also between earning points now or focusing on fish tokens to gain flexibility later. Sparking players to think in 3 dimensions, Coral creates a gameplay experience that feels fresh and unique. The player who earns the most points by completing structures before placing all 16 of their dice (12 in a 4-player game) is the winner!&#10;&#10;&quot;Islands,&quot; designed by Rohan Dargad, asks players to move around archipelago islands from sea-level heights to mountainous terrain in a concerted effort to reclaim lost land caused by rising sea levels. Players thus take the roles of conservation charities. The different coloured dice represent different geology of the islands. Each round 3 land cards are dealt which gives the active player the opportunity to move around an archipelago segment. These are overseen by conservation specialists which are asymmetric rule changes when a stack of cards is taken. Players then take and keep one of the cards from the stack to indicate their geological specialism - and move one of the dice on the archipelago a number of times based on the height of the stack of cards. Dice are continually moved around in this way , until the end of the game where players with the highest specialisms claim the most mountainous lands to score prestige points. The player with the highest prestige wins!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "For What Remains is a skirmish-level series of three wargames set in a post-apocalyptic near future: &#10;&#10;    Streets of Ruin&#10;    Blood on the Rails&#10;    Out of the Basement&#10;&#10;&#10;Out of the Basement features the Erthen and Order of the New Dawn factions, set in the Out of the Basement campaign. The Erthen are a biologically developed race formed from a mixture of human, mineral, and organic matter, and the Order of the New Dawn are creatures from the strange subterranean realm known as the Basement.&#10;&#10;The game is designed for 2-player competitive play or solitaire play, and each set can be played by itself standalone, or combined with other sets to form a larger narrative. Players control characters from one of the game&rsquo;s six Factions.&#10;&#10;There are two ways to play For What Remains: skirmishes and campaigns. Skirmishes are standalone games played for a single victory, with no lasting repercussions. Campaigns are a series of skirmishes linked together to form a larger narrative. For What Remains is a scenario driven game. Each scenario typically has multiple objectives, and combat between factions is usually secondary. Players win skirmishes by gaining victory points through accomplishing these objectives.&#10;&#10;The game board is built from modular tiles which are themed to represent different environments. The default game board is a destroyed urban setting. Players build the game board with nine modular tiles, each of which are divided into a 7x7 grid. Characters use the grids for movement.&#10;&#10;Each character is represented by a counter and has a corresponding character card and tokens. During campaign play, characters improve their attributes and develop new abilities as they progress from Recruit to Veteran and then Elite level. A chit pull system is used for unit activation, and a step-loss system is used for tracking injuries during skirmishes.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

In each turn, you get a number of island cards and a few blanks, and you place them face-down in the different slots at the strip, either above or below. The blank cards are used so you don't give away which slots you are using. When all players are done, everyone reveals the first card and compares the first value (size), and the player with the highest number wins. In the second slot, the smallest size wins, etc.&#10;After each trick, the winning player sorts cards they won by ocean. At the end of the game, whoever has most cards for a given ocean scores for that ocean, ohter players discard their cards for that ocean. The player who has most cards afterwards, wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

Due to time dilation and other pseudo-scientific malarkey, the lower you travel in the 'verses, the greater number of actions you have each round &mdash; but some of those lower 'verses are a bit primitive, so the contraptions you build to use all that sweet power on might not work that well!&#10;&#10;During your turn, you spend your actions to build power supplies and contraptions, and you possibly move to a new 'verse to take advantage of some excess power there. At the end of each round, the power generates from the bottom 'verse up, and players can use that power as it travels from 'verse to 'verse to play one-shot abilities, use character abilities, and power-up their contraptions. Player order matters in each 'verse, so hopefully your opponents left you some power to use!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

There are various types of monsters, including those that are &quot;weak but profitable when cooked&quot; and those that are &quot;strong but cannot be cooked&quot;. Depending on the type monster, you may rather choose to have them appear in your labyrinth.&#10;&#10;In addition to the many monsters in the game, the labyrinth's mysterious effects and items add to the adventure. Those who have read the original &quot;Dungeon Meshi&quot; manga will grin uncontrollably.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)&#10;&#10;",

There are thousands of games - virtual spaces, in which people willingly spend time... or their entire life. A shadow looms over this digital utopia in the form of hacker attacks. The only ones able to defend the sensory worlds are Gamedecs: hardboiled private detectives specializing in the mysteries of the virtual worlds. Become one of them and investigate cases in sensory worlds, gather clues and equipment, conduct corporate investigations and cross them or cooperate with them. Watch out though - your reputation is your ticket to better jobs. But beware - every passing second leads closer to a total crash of the virtual net.&#10;&#10;Gamedec is an adventure game themed around Martin Ann's &quot;Gamedec&quot; novels. Players try to solve cases connected to the global hacker attacks. Each player choose one from 10 available game-detectives and, during the course of the game, upgrade his/her character by collecting equipment cards, acquiring skills (which helps solving cases) and improving reputation (which provides more case-cards). The game ends either when one of the characters collects enough clues to stop the hackers, or when the Net is too damaged and need to be shut down (all players lose).&#10;&#10;",

To achieve your goal you must overcome a sinister adversity. As you travel from location to location, you have to face strong orcs, clever goblins, bloodthirsty wolves, ice giants, all migthy gods, cowardly wizards, greedy merchants, bad people, good people ... can they stop you from reaching your goal?&#10;&#10;Storm Weavers is a story driven game for one person. The player reads the situation in the book and chooses his action, which leads him to another section of the story. You roam the world drawing the map and exploring various locations. Sometimes your way will be bloodthirsty enemies. Then a confrontation begins, which is a tactical part of the game and is carried out on the board, with the participation of battle maps, minis, and dice.&#10;&#10;The game mechanics is based on 2 six side dice. Facing difficult situation you will be asked to roll against one of your attributes. The result leads you to appropriate text section, but don't worry - the story gives you a lot of possibilities to increase your stats.&#10;&#10;The combat is most often resolved on the one of nine battle maps. First Thymin moves and attacks. Then each of the enemies moves and attacks.  The greater the difference between the attributes of the attacker and the defender, the greater the chance of hitting and the amount of damage. You can also use special combat actions, weapons, items or take advantage of the terrain.&#10;&#10;Exploring the world you consistently develop your character, which helps you to win the battles, resolve quests and finally reach your goal.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "The basic idea in Hoax is to pretend to be somebody you are not while working towards the goal of figuring out who other people are. Each player is assigned one of six different characters -- each with its own unique abilities -- but can pretend to be any character and use its corresponding powers.  Abilities are used to acquire 3 different types of goods, which can be spent to get clues to opponents' identities.  If the majority of the other players think you're pretending to be a character that you're not, you must either admit that you are not that character (and permanently lose the use of its power), or reveal that you are and win the game.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented as:&#10;&#10;    Die Erben von Hoax&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The path connecting the two sides of the board must be continuous along the surfaces of the same colour; however, the path can travel along the exposed top or any exposed side of a tile. This means that blocking your opponent is harder than you think!&#10;&#10;Flink is somehow reminiscent of Stefan K&ouml;gl&rsquo;s Caminos (2010), which in turn resembles Cameron Browne&rsquo;s Druid (2004), on which Flink was inspired. Flink distils the mechanism to use a single piece shape, and introduces the innovation of the connecting path being traced like an insect walking along the tops and sides of the pieces to get to the other side. Of course, all of these games (and numerous others) owe their existence to the original connection game: Hex (AKA CON-TAC-TIX, Piet Hein, 1942).&#10;&#10;",

The game includes several game modes, such as Story Campaign and Exploration.&#10;&#10;Working together as one group, the players adventure inside Castle von Loghan where they will face an array of dangers but also will find several valuable treasures.&#10;&#10;During each turn, players have to decide where to go next, solve the secrets of the room in which they have arrived, battle the enemies protecting it, then prepare for the next encounter.&#10;&#10;The only route to winning the game is through survival &mdash; and to survive, they need to work together.&#10;&#10;Notable mechanisms: Sharing of health and clarity, unique narrative events that require careful listening and decision making, a ten-game-long Story Campaign that is filled with the best RPG elements one could expect, easy-to-understand card-based tactical combat that comes with a variety of outcomes.&#10;&#10;Intro to the story:&#10;&#10;In 1970, inside the Albatross Scientific Institute (LOS ANGELES), a group of scientists make contact with a group of hyper-intelligent beings known as the CeDI (Celestial entities from the Downing Ipsys) who claim that humankind is doomed. They have brought with them some of their advanced technology, instructing the humans to make use of it in order to evacuate the Earth which, according to the aliens, will become uninhabitable in approximately 100 years. Aided by the scientists at the Institute, the aliens unlock G.O.D.O.S., an AI they have brought with them from their galaxy. They claim G.O.D.O.S. will help all of humanity... but the aliens seem to have a personal mission linked to G.O.D.O.S. as well; one which they haven&rsquo;t revealed to anyone else. On the 27th of August, G.O.D.O.S. is activated.&#10;&#10;A council is formed and, with the help of the aliens, they begin work on Project KARR. The goal is to build at least five ships that are not only capable of carrying about 1 billion people each, but can keep them alive for hundreds of years. The KARR also serve as colonization units. The news of the aliens and of Project KARR is shared, bit by bit, with the humans, and by 2067, the ships are ready to launch.&#10;&#10;In 2068, the ships leave earth, leaving behind all those who refuse to go.&#10;&#10;Each ship heads towards a different point in space in the hopes of finding a suitable planet to serve as a new home. They cannot go to the aliens&rsquo; solar system, since humans can not survive such a long journey or the interstellar travel required to get there. After several years in transit, the KARR-5 ship collides with a huge meteorite and is heavily damaged. Hundreds of thousands of humans die, and many of the ship&rsquo;s sectors are damaged beyond repair.&#10;&#10;In his desperation, a certain human decides to take matters into his own hands. Owning the only copy of G.O.D.O.S., a man named Deacon Padjin, the Prime Commander of the KARR-5, uploads G.O.D.O.S. to the KARR-5 ship&rsquo;s operating systems. G.O.D.O.S. takes over the entire ship!&#10;&#10;With the help of G.O.D.O.S., the ship is saved. Humans learn how to resurrect the dead by placing the &ldquo;souls&rdquo; of deceased individuals into androids. The newly-resurrected individuals, known as the Resurrected, remain ignorant of their death and subsequent resurrection. This technology becomes so advanced over the years, that it is almost impossible for someone to tell if they&rsquo;re human or a Resurrected. The KARR-5&rsquo;s population begins growing back to its original size.&#10;&#10;G.O.D.O.S. secretly develops a semi-functional time-machine, but after extensive testing, the results are grim: it can only send people to the past, but it can&rsquo;t bring them back, and it cannot send anyone into the future. G.O.D.O.S.&#10;&#10;A few years pass; the KARR-5 is still stationary. Deacon Padjin, who is still deeply involved with the time-travel project, develops a module that allows time-travel to the future. After managing to remove G.O.D.O.S. from the ship's systems, he uses the time-machine to escape to the past, safely, taking the AI and some other people back with him.&#10;&#10;The remaining leaders of the KARR-5 assess the situation and, after 10 years of testing and many different iterations, manage to partially replicate the time-machine.  Having done so, about ten years later, they send a group of KarrSEC agents after Deacon and G.O.D.O.O.S. armed with a state-of-the-art tracking device, capable of following someone through time.  As there have been no changes to their timeline, it is a widely-believed hypothesis that Deacon succumbed to an untimely death, either during the jump or as a result of it.  However, the KARR-5 Council, and the KarrSEC, want to ensure that G.O.D.O.S. be dismantled so that it can&rsquo;t make any modifications to the timeline, thus changing the course of History forever.&#10;&#10;Meanwhile, the CeDI engage in secret meetings with some of the scientists from the Institute, informing them that the loss of G.O.D.O.S. will most likely have disastrous consequences. The CeDI finally reveal their true intentions: they need G.O.D.O.S. to break through a time bubble that has been placed around their planet in which an intergalactic battle is being fought. Without G.O.D.O.S., the CeDI will likely lose the battle, which could easily spread to other parts of the galaxy, a threat that none but the CeDI is prepared to face.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "&quot;Goeben, 1914&quot; is a wargame simulation which puts you in command of the SMS Goeben, the German battlecruiser that made a historically epic voyage through the Mediterranean during the opening days of World War One. This is a solitaire wargame in which the player must accomplish a specific &ldquo;objective&rdquo; to win the game, which will be generated at random at the start of the scenario. The player must manage the various outfittings and functions of the SMS Goeben and its escorting light cruiser, the SMS Breslau. As you fight your way through the Mediterranean, you will encounter various Allied warships, merchantmen for raiding, and unexpected opportunities and objectives. These are represented by &ldquo;Incident&rdquo; chits.&#10;&#10;German ships in the game are shown in detail. Allied ships are shown in a more abstract way because you, the player, are seeing the situation from the standpoint of Admiral Souchon, the fleet commander of the German Mediterranean Division. The possibility of running into enemy warships will be increased via the &ldquo;Alert Level&rdquo;, which represents how much the Royal Navy&rsquo;s Admiralty is concentrating its resources against your task force. The game can be played with two players, one in command of the Goeben, the other in command of the Breslau.&#10; Each game turn represents about one day, and each sea spaces are approximately 100 miles apart. Most warship counters represent one ship each, although some counters represent flotillas, such as destroyer and convoy chits.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #220.&#10;&#10;Group of Soviet Forces Germany features a simulation of a hypothetical Soviet invasion of Germany in the late 1970's. It is a two-player alternative history game intended to examine what could've happened during the first month of fighting had the Soviets opted to invade Germany during the Cold War.  An assumption is made that the invasion would've been executed without lengthy preparation or forewarning.&#10;&#10;This game is an update and revision of SPI's 1973 release, &quot;NATO: Operational Combat in Europe in the 1970s&quot;. Its time and space scales have been preserved, but the map has been improved by reflecting a more in depth terrain analysis. The system has been updated and the orders of battle are more fully developed. Air warfare has been added, at least as an abstract, and tactical nukes have been taken away except as possible game enders.&#10;&#10;The orders of battle for both sides are based on open-source documents that have become available since the parent game was first published. The system, though more complex than that of the original game, still comes in toward the lower end of today's complexity scale. Experienced gamers can expect to be blasting away within 90 minutes or so of first opening the box.&#10;&#10;Each hexagon on the map represents approximately 10 miles (16.2 kilometers) from side to opposite side. The Soviet units of maneuver are divisions, as are most NATO units, along with a few brigades and regiments. Each full game turn represents two days.&#10;&#10;The game map illustrates the militarily significant terrain found in the western portion of Germany and its environs in the late 1970s. There are 280 unit counters in the game, most of which represent combat formations. Others are also provided as informational markers and memory aids.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

To leave the shelter of the cities is to brave the Ash Wastes &ndash; a massive expanse of polluted and desolate dunes inhabited by outcasts, prospectors, and those who have adapted to life in these harsh environments. Gangs are often employed to protect caravans and convoys when commerce between the hive cities is necessary, and the nomads of the wastes prey on them for both sustenance and sport.&#10;&#10;In Necromunda, you'll take control of a vicious gang, building them up from green recruits to hardened veterans as they claw their way to power through bitterly-fought skirmishes with their rivals. Necromunda: Ash Wastes takes the action out of the claustrophobic and dangerous sprawl of the hive cities, and into the agoraphobic and deadly wastelands.

The aim of the game is to score more points by winning awards for actors and film directing, building the structures of their studio, or producing more films of different genres. The player must decide which strategy to follow early in the game based on the script and cast with which depart.&#10;&#10;The game consists of three or five rounds corresponding to three years.

For each card played you will place its own &quot;Producer&quot; (worker) to activate areas on your dashboard (the studios) or different locations on the main scoreboard that represent Hollywood.&#10;&#10;You can buy scripts, engage the biggest movie star of the time, young players with a great future and legendary directors.

There is a shortage of bread and on the borders the Austrians and Prussians are ready to invade. The press has become mighty popular, publicly denouncing traitors and calling the populace to arms. There are some that believe that the Revolution has gone far enough, but for others it has yet to begin.

Each of the players belong to a different political faction, each with their own agenda. Although they are rivals, they will have to work together to prevent the armies of Austria, Prussia and Sardinia-Piedmont from reaching Paris, thereby crushing the Revolution and ending the game prematurely!&#10;&#10;With the help of the multi-functional action cards, the players will be able to influence a number of areas in Paris (National Convention, Palais-Egalit&eacute;, the Paris streets&hellip;) or the provinces.

Activated leader cards (Robespierre, Marat, Dumouriez) belonging to their faction will help them in achieving their goals IF they are not arrested or assassinated!&#10;&#10;1793:Patriots &amp; Traitors is fresh, assymetrical, high in replayability and very, very thematic.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Once someone completes a certain area, they get points based on the value of that area. This value then decreases. At the end, everyone gets extra points for connected objects or groups. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Battlefields of Olympus is a quick turn based strategy game with some hand management. The numerous tactical choices, combined with a limited military force and the unexpected appearance of Ares on the battlefield, give the game its strategic component. The relatively simple game mechanics make it easy to learn and play, even if you aren't a tactical genius.&#10;&#10;Backstory&#10;&quot;In the kingdom of immortals, the restless gods decree that mortal man will fight one another to prove their loyalty. By order of Zeus, The war god Ares leaves his throne to inform man of this noble contest. To the victors go the spoils of war and eternal gratitude from the gods.&#10;&#10;As the general of battle hardened archers, infantry, and other units, you have been commissioned by the high priests to lead your people to victory. When the sisters of fate look favorably upon you, your armies will find strategic advantage on the battlefield. Ambush, flank and surround your opponent's forces in an effort to gain the upper hand.  If the battle looks bleak, call on your mercenary forces to turn the tide.&quot;&#10;&#10;Game Overview&#10;The idea behind Battlefields of Olympus is to secure a number of Land Trophy cards through battle using Warrior cards and Action cards. The one with the most valuable lands by the end of the game is victor. Battlefields of Olympus is a tug of war, where each player must decide when to use his forces to fight and when it is better to retreat and gather strength for later battles.&#10;&#10;There is also an element of press your luck as the appearance of Ares and the order that land turns up during the game is randomly predetermined. On the other hand, when there is a stack of face-up Land Trophy cards, strategic planning is paramount, as players must decide when it is better to concede a battle in favor of a more valuable Land Trophy card farther down in the stack.&#10;&#10;Each player commands a legion of up to 4 Warrior cards, but there is often a reserve pile of Warrior cards to draw from at the end of battle. Players need to decide when it is better to keep more powerful Warriors in hand and when it is better to retire the weaker ones from their reserve pile. The limit of 4 Action cards in hand forces players to manage what actions they need most.&#10;&#10;The optional fortify and sacrifice rules create more tension as players have additional tough decisions to make. Using the Fortify action will protect your land, but at the risk of temporarily weakening the size of your military force in hand. Do you sacrifice a piece of hard-fought land in favor of your opponent's more valuable property, or do you wait until a valuable Land Trophy card turns up on the land pile.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Scrap Racer is a push-your-luck dice game that is suitable for novice gamers or seasoned veterans looking for a raucous experience.&#10;&#10;You are a daredevil Scrap Racer who knows only one goal: Win the race&mdash;no matter how dangerous!&#10;&#10;A race lasts for three laps, and whomever leads the field at that point will be the winner. Each racer needs boldness, tactical skills, and some good luck if they want to be the winner at the end of the race.&#10;&#10;On a turn, the active player rolls up to six dice (one at a time) and advances their racer according to the results. But be careful! If you roll doubles, you must draw a crash card and anything can happen&mdash;depending on the double you may get a boost or be slowed down, letting others catch up. However, you can gain bonus cards for repeated doubles that can make up for lost position, if used correctly.&#10;&#10;Using the unique abilities of the racers and collecting Boost markers, the players can manipulate the outcome of the race to their advantage. On top of all of this, players may have to fight for track position. Whenever two racers share the same space, a duel takes place to decide who will advance by one space and who will stay.&#10;&#10;Finally, crossing the finish line will shuffle the racers&rsquo; positions due to the effects of the goal cards.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",
