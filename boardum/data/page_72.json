    "description": "Yu-Gi-Oh! Dice Masters is a dice-building game patterned after Quarriors! that features custom dice representing various characters from the 4K Media show.&#10;&#10;In the game, each player brings a set of dice to the table; these form his team, from which only he can purchase dice. In addition, each player brings two basic action cards, which are placed in the center of the table; both players can purchase them.&#10;&#10;During a turn, a player draws and rolls a number of his dice, purchases additional dice, and fields character dice to attack the other player. A player wins once the opposing player has been reduced to zero life.&#10;&#10;Yu-Gi-Oh! Dice Masters is one of several planned Dice Masters games, all of which can be intermixed (or played alone).&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Two games in one package.&#10;&#10;&#10;1914: Glory's End&#10;&#10;Before the award-winning World War I designs Paths of Glory and The Great War In Europe, Deluxe Edition, designer Ted S. Raicer had revived interest in gaming the Great War with a series of WWI campaign games for the late lamented Command magazine. GMT is proud to present a set of revised boxed editions of these classic &ldquo;players-games&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;In August 1914, Imperial Germany gambled its future on a rapid conquest of France, designed to free up the German army within six weeks to face the Russian steamroller of France&rsquo;s Tsarist ally on the eastern front. Seven German armies deployed opposite five French armies, the army of &ldquo;plucky little Belgium&rdquo;, and the &ldquo;Old Contemptibles&rdquo; of the British Expeditionary Force in a series of battles that turned August and September 1914 into the bloodiest months of the entire war.&#10;&#10;1914: Glory&rsquo;s End covers the first three months of the Great War on the western front, from the Guns of August to First Ypres. This oft-gamed campaign receives a unique treatment, emphasizing playability without compromising on historical feel. Units are mostly corps of four steps (two counters per unit), along with a few especially strong (or weak) brigades and divisions, along with counters for the feared German Krupp and Skoda guns. The corps level Order of Battle accurately reflects the operational doctrine of the campaign, while also limiting the number of counters on the map to an easy-to-manage level.&#10;&#10;The game scale is 9.5 miles per hex and three days per turn. The campaign game runs a full 30 turns, but the new edition will include not only a previously published mini-scenario on the Battle of the Marne, but a short ten turn campaign scenario covering the decisive opening weeks of the war. In addition the campaign games can be played in historical or free set-up versions.&#10;&#10;1914: Glory&rsquo;s End uses an Igo-Hugo system with two types of combat to demonstrate the tactical realities of the campaign: Prepared Combat and March Combat. Prepared Combat allows you to bring all your adjacent units to bear against a defending hex, but only with units that don&rsquo;t move. This gives the defender time to reinforce, retreat, or pre-empt your combat with his own attack. To avoid this, you can &ldquo;attack off the march&rdquo; during your movement, but March Combat may only be delivered by a single stack at a time, limiting the force you can bring to bear. Furthermore, March Combat cannot be used against entrenched enemy units.&#10;&#10;The coming of trench warfare is reflected by a unique Entrenchment rule: starting on turn 10 players may entrench one or two hexes per turn, PLUS any hexes adjacent to enemy trenches. The result is that trenches appear first as a tactical consideration, but then turn into a strategic problem as they spread with ever-increasing rapidity along the front.&#10;&#10;1914: Glory&rsquo;s End manages to cover all the important characteristics of the campaign (with rules for forts, cavalry, command and control breakdowns, supply, strategic rail movement, Allied sea movement, German forced marching, Plan XVII, Paris in Danger! and more) while remaining easy to play. The new GMT version will of course incorporate all errata from the original edition, but adds updated artwork, a corrected historical campaign Order of Battle, additional scenarios, and a tweaked set of rules.&#10;&#10;&#10;When Eagles Fight&#10;&#10;Before the award-winning World War I designs Paths of Glory and The Great War In Europe, Deluxe Edition, designer Ted S. Raicer had revived interest in gaming the Great War with a series of WWI campaign games for the late lamented Command magazine. GMT is proud to present a set of revised boxed editions of these classic &ldquo;players-games&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;Winner of the Charles S. Roberts award for best pre-WWII boardgame, When Eagles Fight covers the eastern front in World War I, the last war of Tsarist Russia, Habsburg Austria, and Imperial Germany. From 1914 to 1917 the armies of the Tsar battled from the Carpathians to the Baltic against the outnumbered but logistically superior German army and the badly-led multi-ethnic forces of Austria-Hungary (the Central Powers). Though repeatedly inflicting massive defeats on the Habsburg armies, the Russians were ultimately undone by the skill and firepower of the German army and the collapsing political structure of the Tsarist autocracy. By March 1917 the 300 year-old Romanov dynasty was no more, and the stage was set for the coming of Lenin and the Bolsheviks. But the empire of the Habsburgs was left mortally wounded, and the Kaiser&rsquo;s Germany would meet its own doom less than two years later on the battlefields of the western front.&#10;&#10;When Eagles Fight recreates this titanic struggle from the initial clashes at Tannenberg and in Galicia to the revolution that brought down Tsar Nicholas II. The large-hex map covers the eastern front of the Great War from the northern tip of Romania to Petrograd, and from Berlin to Smolensk at a scale of 25 miles to the hex. Turns represent one or two months, and combat units range from division to (mostly) corps.&#10;&#10;When Eagles Fight has a set of low-complexity rules, without sacrificing the historical elements of this unique theater of the Great War. The combat results table is bloody and attritional, but allows for breakthroughs with the right tactics or artillery support. The greater operational skills of the German army is shown in the use of the OberOst HQ, which allows additional attacks on a select part of the front. The Russian supreme headquarters, Stavka, in turn has the ability to concentrate their limited supplies to overcome logistical shortages. And the surprise tactics of the Brusilov Offensive can allow a late game victory over the Austrians.&#10;&#10;Other rules cover the slow pace of Russian mobilization, Austrian Lock-Step Planning in the opening days of the war, German heavy artillery, fortifications, Russian Guards forces, Cavalry Retreats, and the effects of events on other fronts.&#10;&#10;But the new edition of When Eagles Fight is more than just a reprint of the original version. The Random Events Table has been exchanged for a system of random events chits allowing for more events. The effects if the Germans do not launch a Verdun offensive in France-which sometimes threw off the balance of the original design- have been revised. Changes in the stacking rules after 1914 more accurately reflect the effect of trenches on the course of the campaigns. And the map now contains the rail lines removed by Command from the first edition. The game also includes a short alternative-history scenario in which the bulk of the German army goes east rather than west in August 1914.&#10;&#10;These changes make this an improved edition of an already award-winning design. Tense, historical, and just plain fun, When Eagles Fight is a game that belongs in the collection of everyone with an interest in the Great War!&#10;&#10;",

Whenever the Impulse is emptied of Emotions, each player's Mindset is scored, granting Bliss or Gloom Identity Fragments. The goal of the game is to collect enough Fragments to fully develop the Identity.&#10;&#10;Players can get Fragments by invoking Emotions into their Mindset, however, these Fragments can be spent for the effect of the Emotions' Abilities, so it is up to the players to decide wether they hold on to their victory points or spend some of them to be more efficient. Emotion effects can interact with other Mindsets, other players' hands, the Impulse, but can be cancelled by discarding Emotions of the matching type.&#10;&#10;The game ends if one of the players manages to build a fully single-minded (collecting eight or more of one type of Fragment) or a balanced personality (collecting five or more of both Fragment types).&#10;&#10;The game consists of 96 Emotion cards, 80 Identity Fragments, 5 player aid cards and a Mood Marker.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

His reign was full of prosperity in all areas, like culture, science and politics. His life and his famous court are said to be the ispiration for the &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot; collection of folk stories.&#10;&#10;In Al Rashid, players will take the role of the heads of powerful families, and will use the members of their families for trading, travelling, and ultimately trying to exercise influence over the court of the powerful ruler.&#10;&#10;Al Rashid is a mostly deterministic strategy game &ndash; with a slight hint of randomness &ndash; based on worker placement, influence, resource management, and the efficient scoring of prestige points (PPs). As heads of families, players will have three different worker types at their disposal: the Sage, the Merchant and the Pasha. The three different types of workers, each with a different influence value, can be placed on the map of ancient Middle East to gain resources, or can be placed on the corporations to get more workers, or on government and imperial offices. The corporations represent several powers at the court of the Caliph: Intrigue, War, Science, Commerce, and Politics.&#10;&#10;The game takes place over five turns, with turns split into two main phases: the placement phase and the resolution phase. Each phase is split in several rounds. During the placement phase players take turns placing their workers on the board. During the resolution phase they take turns deciding which action will be resolved. Each action, either a zone on the map or a corporation, can hold workers from all of the five players, but only the top three players, identified by influence and placement order will get to resolve the move. During placement workers can be added to the same areas to improve a players's influence. Players with higher influence will get a bigger and better effect out of the action they are resolving.&#10;&#10;Resolving geographical areas will give a player resources. The resources come in five flavors: Wood, Pottery, Metal, Spice and Silk, and they can be used in trades. The dominating player &ndash; that is, the one with more influence, or in case of a tie, the one who placed first &ndash; will get three different resources, or all of the resources of one type (resources are distributed unevenly on the map), the second player will get two different resources and the third player just one.&#10;&#10;The resources gained by resolving geographical areas can be used in the corporations to buy more workers or get government offices. Government offices work more or less like buildings in other placement games. Some give permanent advantages, some have a one-shot effect, and some can be used every turn. As for the geographical areas, having more influence will be advantageous, and dominating players will get cheaper workers or better effects out of the corporations.&#10;&#10;The game contains no currency, so players will need to be careful when they combine resources to get money because if they pay more than they should, no change will be returned.&#10;&#10;Every turn raiders will spontaneously appear on random locations on the map, so players will need to use some of their actions to hire mercenaries that can be used to combat the raiders and give them access to resources. Players accumulate PPs when they buy offices and workers, and at the end of the fifth turn the player with more PPs is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;",

Aided by Corto and resisting Rasputin's attempts to thwart your plans, recruit your own bands of adventurers and get your hands on gold at the end of the story!&#10;&#10;Corto is a card-based adventure game that mixes tactics and luck. To set up the game, choose four of the six quests, then place the appropriate quest boards next to one another on the table; each quest (attack the train of Russian gold, research the four aces of whale bones, meet the leopard-men, etc.) has its own deck of character and object cards that's shuffled and placed on the left side of the board. Reveal the top character from each deck, take turns placing one of your tokens on any character, then draw four cards from any combination of decks for your starting hand.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you can either discard any number of cards and fill your hand to four cards or you can play 1-4 cards. If you play a character card, place it on an empty space on the quest board of the same color, making sure that it's adjacent to at least one other character. Place a token on the card, then either add a token to or remove an opponent's token from an adjacent character depending on the character's border color (denoting a friend of Corto or associate of Rasputin). You can also play objects on the character to affect adjacent cards. Some characters and objects have long range effects that hit any character in the same column or row. Hit a character that has no tokens, and you remove it from the board, counting it as 1 gold at the end of the game. If you played cards, end your turn by drawing two cards.&#10;&#10;Players can also move Corto and Rasputin directly, using them to block spaces on the quest board, claim gold immediately, or eliminate characters.&#10;&#10;In addition to having its own mix of characters, objects and advantages, each quest has a different treasure waiting for players to nab. For &quot;The Wreck of the Fortune Royale&quot;, you need to be the first to claim the aces in order to claim all the treasure for yourself; for &quot;Admiral Kolchak's Bullion Train&quot;, if you attack the train &mdash; which moves across the quest boards as players lay down cards &mdash; you claim one of the train car tokens, which might have gold on it; for &quot;On the Track of the Leopard Men&quot;, whoever has a majority of tokens on certain characters at the end of the game gains control of markers that might enhance their network of characters.&#10;&#10;When two quests are fully occupied or the players run out of cards, the game ends. In addition to scoring for the gold and treasures they've collected during the game, each player scores 2 gold per character in the largest group of characters he controls and 1 gold per character for smaller groups. Whoever ends up with the most gold wins!&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Building trains is an integral part of America's history. Now the tradition continues with Express, a unique card game for the 90's. Reminiscent of classic card games but including new play twists, Express is as easy to learn as rummy. Players start with one or two car trains and build on their meld to maximize points and bonuses. But players must be wary of train wrecks and derailments. Unique play allows partners to pass key cards to each other during the game.&#10;&#10;The cards represent various train cars, freight, passenger and way, diesel locomotives and disasters.&#10;&#10;Cards are shuffled and dealt to each player, and remaining cards form a draw pile.  Turns consist of drawing either two cards from the face down draw pile or one face up card from the discard pile, melding cards from one's hand and discarding a card.  Players must end their turns with no more than five cards in their hands.  Players meld cards to form freight trains or passenger trains, or they meld individual way cars.  Freight trains are melded so that all the cars are of the same type, such as box car, tank car or auto carrier.  However, a wild card car can be used to have two types of cars in the same freight train.  Passenger trains may contain any or all of the different types of passenger cars.  Each train needs a locomotive which can be any card placed face down.  There is a locomotive pictured on the back of each card.  During the melding phase of their turn, players may exchange face down locomotive cards with any card in their hand.  This feature allows partners to share cards when the game is played by four or six.&#10;&#10;Disaster cards may be played as discards.  They can change the direction of play, allow theft of an opponent's car or wreck an entire train.  Way car cards either absorb the damage of corresponding disasters or remedy them in a fashion similar to the Coup Fourre' of Mille Bornes.&#10;&#10;Hands end when a player or partnership &quot;goes out.&quot;  To do this the player's melds must consist of at least one five car train, one four car train and all other trains must be at least three cars long.  The player then melds all but one card which he discards.  Trains and way cars are scored.  Cards left in players hands count against them.&#10;&#10;The game is played in hands until one player or partnership accumulates the points needed to win.  The player or partnership with the most points at the end of that hand wins.&#10;&#10;",

That potential danger is why you're alone in your boat, on your own but eager to take a run on the island and try your luck.&#10;&#10;For now, only the sound of the waves and the cries of the gulls disturb the peace of this seemingly idyllic island...but as soon as you set foot in the jungle bordering the beach, the drums of war start sounding and you realize that you've suddenly gained the status of prey!&#10;&#10;Pingo Pingo is a hyper-frenetic action game punctuated by a soundtrack in which you have to react quickly, run, shoot a gun, in which you must be precise, brave, fast, and focused because if not, well, you might not leave the island in one piece. As soon as the soundtrack begins, the game is on!&#10;&#10;On your turn, reveal the top card from your deck and place it face-up in the middle of the table. Each card requires a specific action when it is revealed. Be the first to tap on a treasure to grab it, but watch out for traps and critters, and make sure the music allows you to take this treasure. Tap on camp cards to steal cards from the other players' stashes. Adventure cards trigger actions to be completed before the &quot;Pingo Pingo&quot; cry in the soundtrack. Get up and run from one base to another to cross a suspension bridge. Grab the gun and aim well to defeat fearsome bear riders. Tap the friendly monkey sorcerer to regain life. Run to the shipwreck and back to shoot the gigantic space penguin. Grab all the previously played cards and deal them as fast as you can to escape the penguin rampage!&#10;&#10;Any mistake will cost you one of your seven life points. After 15 minutes, the player with the most treasures wins the game &mdash; but don't be reckless because you can't carry more than three treasures per life point...&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "For over 2000 years the Chinese have tried to dominate their neighbors to the south. The last time was 1979 when the PRC invaded Vietnam in response to the latter's invasion and occupation of Cambodia. That war lasted about four weeks before China withdrew, having declared its mission accomplished. &#10; Now, the old foes are at it once again. Sparring over the resource rich areas of the South China Sea, both sides have been slowly edging toward the precipice of war. That day has now come.&#10;&#10;Next War: Vietnam is the fifth game in the Next War Series. This game returns the action to Asia and the powderkeg surrounding the South China Sea. This time the Chinese don't intend a limited, punitive expedition; they intend to squash the burgeoning threat from their southern border once and for all and prove, through force of arms, that the South China Sea is theirs. Building on the naval rules showcased Next War: Taiwan, players will have a chance to fight over the Spratly and Paracel Islands once again, as well as the mountainous jungle of North Vietnam. &#10; If the U.S. gets involved, it might finally land troops in Haiphong Harbor and march on Hanoi, albeit as a relief force and an ally to its former enemy. The question is what will the rest of the region do? Will they join a side or stay neutral?&#10; Next War: Vietnam will also allow players to play a combined game with Next War:Taiwan, and, with the rules in the latter game, adding on NextWar: Korea as well for what would amount to the Pacific Front of World War III. &#10; Ownership of any previous Next War Series will NOT be required to play Next War: Vietnam.&#10;&#10;Units: &#10; Next War: Vietnam primarily represents divisions and brigades of the armies of the People's Republic of China (PRC) and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam (SRV). All ground units are rated for their attack and defense strengths, movement capabilities, and unit efficiency. The Vietnamese People's Self Defense Force is represented both by units and special rules. &#10; Air units represent the fighter, bomber, and attack squadrons of the major combatants. They are rated for All-Weather Capabilities, range, average pilot skill and training, and their capabilities in Air-to-Air Combat, Close Air Support, and Strike missions. &#10; Naval units represent an abstraction of groups of ships (task forces) and allow players to conduct amphibious invasions, naval combat, naval gunfire support, and more. &#10; Maps and Terrain &#10; The game&rsquo;s map represents the area in and around the northern border of Vietnam at a scale of roughly 7.5 miles per hex. The map stretches from just west of Dien Bien Phu, Vietnam to just east of Nanning, China and just north of the PRC-SRV border to a few miles south of Thanh Hoa, Vietnam. &#10; The Spratlys, Paracels, and other sea areas are represented by a Strategic Display incorporating Land Areas and At Sea Boxes similar to the one in Next War: Taiwan. &#10; Game System &#10; A game turn is composed of:&#10;&#10;Weather Determination wherein bad weather can severely hamper air and naval operations activity and can significantly slow ground operations. &#10;Initiative Determination and Air/Naval Phase, wherein Air Superiority levels and air availability are determined and Sea Control is established or modified.&#10;Special Operations Phases in the Advanced Game allow players to utilize their special operators in various recon and raid missions behind enemy lines. &#10;Strike Phases in the Advanced Game allow players to launch air strikes, cruise missiles, and artillery and SSM strikes. &#10;One or more Movement and Combat Phases that allow both sides to move, react, and fight, with an advantage to the Initiative player on non-Contested turns. &#10;Arrival of Reinforcements and Replacements &#10;Victory Determination&#10;&#10;Combat resolution examines not only unit strengths but also unit efficiency (representing training, doctrine, and morale), as well as the terrain where the combat takes place. The CRT tends to be very bloody in nature, reflecting what we believe will be a degree of attritional warfare early due to the lethality of modern weapons. As in many games, casualties represent not only actual combat losses but also losses of unit cohesion brought about by the rapid pace with which modern armies are able to engage and exploit on the battlefield.&#10;&#10;Scenarios&#10;&#10;There are several Standard Game scenarios. Some are small and focus on limited objectives, while at least one will be a campaign game encompassing the entire map. Similarly to previous games in the series, the Advanced Game scenarios will be divided into various starting points representing different levels of build-up before the game begins.&#10;&#10;Next War: Vietnam puts you in command of the potential conflict. Can you, as the Chinese player, enforce your will on Vietnam and achieve your goals in the South China Sea, shaping your position in world affairs? Or will you, as the Vietnamese player, once again successfully defend against your larger northern neighbor?&#10;&#10;",

In addition, Astronauts are charged with completing experiments by rolling dice and assigning them to their experiment, but they don't have all the information that they need to complete them. Mission Control can spend tokens to relay key pieces of information to the Astronauts that they need to complete their tasks or to aid the Astronauts by providing bonuses to their dice or boosting systems. Mission Control also tracks the flight and experiment progress on the ground via a panel of sliders. Failure to maintain flight systems can cause disasters like comm failures preventing Mission Control and the Astronauts from talking to each other.&#10;&#10;Missions are based on real-life NASA missions and missions are won by completing varying numbers of flight stages and experiments based on the mission.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Tricks and the Phantom is a simple deduction game using only ten (or eleven) cards with a little bluffing element. Deduce the culprit from among the four persons. However, there may be a &quot;phantom&quot; who attempts to confuse you.&#10;&#10;In the base game, ten cards are dealt to four players, so players have hands of only two or three cards. As in a trick-taking game, each player plays one card face down in turn order. While doing this, each player forecasts who has the highest card (that is, the culprit). Each card has a color (suit), and you have to show that color when you play the card; this allows opponents to narrow down the number of your card, but some cards have a special effect, so big numbers don't win automatically. Points are awarded to whoever played the highest card (the culprit) and to whoever correctly forecasted that player winning.&#10;&#10;Tricks and the Phantom is not just card luck. It is a strategy inference game that requires you to read each other's psychology.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Galaxy of Trian is a dynamic tile-based sci-fi board game. During the game you take command over one of a few opposing races, fighting over a territory and technology left by a powerful race Trian. You have at your disposal few kinds of basic units and spaceships allowing a great deal of interaction. Different types of ships will come with the new add-ons. Tiles are two-sided and stacked into two piles during the game, which gives more tactical possibilities and, at the same time, limits randomness. Special tiles, like teleport, exmitter or trade station increase level of interaction and give even more tactical possibilities.&#10;&#10;We made all possible efforts to give the game its unique, individual character and to distinguish it from others with the specific elements of game mechanisms. The goal was to make a game, which could be different each time it is played. Moreover, it was important that during the match players could decide which game variants they want to play, taking into account variable add-ons. Every add-on is a &ldquo;module&rdquo;, which can be combined with the basic version of the game and used to make your own variants. Basic version can be combined with any number of add-ons.&#10;&#10;We wanted the game to be dynamic, with the playtime of about 60 min. We reached said time playing the strategic variant with the add-on &ldquo;Beginning of Conquer&rdquo;, which really pleases us. In the deluxe version, the game is composed of 84 beautifully illustrated, two sided tiles with 168 diverse graphics. There are no two identical graphics in the game; every nebula, planet and gas looks unique.&#10;&#10;GAME MECHANICS AND RULES:&#10;&#10;The matches are played in turns, which take place in a clockwise manner. Starting with the first player, every subsequent draws a tile in their turn and places it on the table. This way, planetary systems, nebulas and space (in which the spaceships travel) of different sizes are created. From nebulas we receive a certain amount of resources (crystals) every turn. The basic unit of the game is an emissary, who can fight over nebulas and planetary systems. If the system is won over, the emissary is able to take control of the research stations left by the Trian race. Stations can be leveled up. The points in the game can be obtained in various ways. By means of: closing planetary systems, nebulas, and space; leveling up the stations on nebulas and collecting resources (crystals) from them; conducting research or fights between ships. Game mechanics allow the application of different strategies and tactics. The game also includes tiles allowing special actions.&#10;&#10;What defines Galaxy of Trian:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Simple rules which can be explained within few minutes, using clear, illustrated game instruction&#10;    Brilliant game mechanics, which will charm everyone and provide a great number of possible tactics and strategies. The game is incredibly exciting, it offers many ways to win and a great deal of interaction between players&#10;    Smooth and dynamic matches, without tie-ups and lengthy waiting for your turn. Match lasts 45 &ndash; 60 min.&#10;    Game variants adjusted to players age and expectations&#10;    As one of a few board games it is great for two, three and four players&#10;    Beautiful graphics made with great care and attention to details&#10;    Tiles construction allows countless combinations. Each time a completely different-looking fragment of the galaxy is formed. You will return to the Galaxy of Trian frequently. Simply, this game is never boring!&#10;&#10;&#10;",

It is based on Francis Tresham's game 1829 and on Leonhard Orgler's game 1837.&#10;&#10;Historical realities have, as far as possible, been taken into account. In other places the history should and must be written anew. &#10;The player who has the greatest wealth in cash and shares at the end of the game is the winner. A set of simple mechanisms form the basis of 1824 Austria-Hungary.&#10;&#10;You use the yellow, green, brown and grey tiles to create a rail network on the map. Just as in a real railway business, the track in the game connects railway stations to each other. The trains (train cards) make notional journeys from one station to the next and thereby earn money. The (imaginary) passengers pay for their journeys. The more numerous and the more important the stations on a train's journey are, the more money it earns for the company and its shareholders.&#10;&#10;In the game you and your fellow players can own up to 6 Mountain Railways, 4 Coal Railways, 7 forerunners of the National Railways, as well as shares in 3 National Railways and 5 Regional Railways. The Major Companies (the National and Regional Railways) belong to their shareholders. The player with the most shares in the company is the Director of that company and decides how the company will act.&#10;&#10;",

Pirate warehouses are equivalent to settlements in Catan, and the player receive resources from these warehouses whenever a die roll matches the number showing on that island. These resources take the form of equipment cards, and the resources are wood, wool, rum, sabers and gold. With these, players construct ships and more pirate warehouses or buy development cards. Instead of a robber, players must now beware of a Ghost Pirate, which can block the resources normally provided by a warehouse.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with two pirate warehouses, and the first player to build seven warehouses wins. In order to build a new warehouse, however, a player must go by ship from an existing warehouse to a new construction site, which thus keeps players alternating between constructing ships and warehouses.&#10;&#10;Aside from the change in theme, other changes between The Settlers of Catan and Catan: Junior include the elimination of cities (i.e., warehouses can't be upgraded) and the distance rule between settlements, resources allocated by the roll of one die instead of a pair of D6s, and the introduction of a marketplace that allows trading with the bank. At the start of the game, one equipment card of each type is placed in the marketplace; on a player's turn, he can exchange one card in hand for a card in the marketplace. At certain times in the game, the marketplace is cleared and reset to feature one equipment card of each type.&#10;&#10;",

Capture highly desired butterflies, put them in your trusty jar, and deliver them to the garden to gain respect from the collecting community and to help diversify the garden &mdash; but watch out for your opponents as lepidopterists can be quite devious!&#10;&#10;The game is played in a series of rounds. Players start each round by playing a card from their hands to determine the round's turn order. Cards are numbered from 0 to 59, and lower numbered cards will go first. On a turn, a player captures butterflies from the field and adds them to the jar (i.e., they take a card from the row of face-up cards and tuck it under their jar card). When possible, players &quot;deliver butterflies&quot; from their jars to the zoo's butterfly garden to score victory points (VPs). Which butterflies can be delivered is indicated on the face-up &quot;delivery cards&quot; and players are often in a race to deliver butterflies to take the cards and score points. The player with the most VPs at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;During the game, players must carefully decide which butterfly cards to play. By playing lowered numbered cards, players not only get a better pick of butterflies in the field, but they also get first chance at delivering butterflies. However, lower numbered butterfly cards usually have fewer butterflies on them, so players cannot add as many to their jars. Also, butterfly cards with special powers usually have high numbers, so you often must sacrifice turn order in order to use one of these special powers.&#10;&#10;",

All of the gang members are placed around an oblong table, with some of the places indicating certain benefits.  If a place has a picture of a business, then the player makes money until the mobster is killed or moved.  If the place has a gun, then he can use it to shoot a mobster across the table.  If a place has a knife, then he can use it to stab someone seated next to him.  Plus, some of the mobsters have the ability to kill others all the time by carrying their own knives and guns.

    "description": "Panzer Battles: 11th Panzer on the Chir River, is a Standard Combat Series (SCS) game by Multi-Man Publishing and covers the classic mobile defensive Chir River Battles of the German 11th Panzer Division against the culminating point spearheads of Soviet Operation Uranus. The Soviets have successfully entombed the Stalingrad Pocket and are in the process of locking down the pocket even harder.&#10;&#10;In December, 1942. Strong Soviet forces, including the 1st Tank and 5th Mechanized Armies, conducted a concerted attack against German positions in an attempt to block relief efforts directed at Stalingrad from the west. In what is considered a masterpiece of mobile defensive warfare, the German 11th Panzer Division fought a lightning series of &lsquo;fire brigade&rsquo; battles to contain and beat back the efforts of the Soviets to further seal the Stalingrad Area west of the Don Bend.&#10;&#10;In an interesting twist of events, the German 11th Panzer Division, recently arrived from France is preparing to take part in the northern portion of the German relief attempt on Stalingrad (Operation Winter Storm). Full strength and available, the division launches into the Soviet drive in what has become a textbook example of a mobile defense and counter-attack which is studied to this day. It originated the term 'Fire Brigade' as used on the Eastern Front in WW2.&#10;&#10;Under the energetic leadership of Generalmajor Hermann Balck and his Chief of Staff Oberstleutnant von Mellinthin, the 11th Panzer was able to defeat the Soviet mechanized drive.&#10;&#10;German accounts stop right there, with a German victory. However, the win (if it can be called that) was a Faustian bargain. The Soviet drive was stopped, but at the cost of the German units designated to make the Stalingrad relief effort. There would be no Northern Pincer now. The Southern Pincer soldiered on alone. And failed.&#10;&#10;The game covers all this swirling mobile action in turn representing two to three days and a hex scale of 500 meters.  Units are companies to regiments. Play is highly interactive (the only way to show its mobile nature) using a chit pull system by formation. The rules are a continued adaptation of the system shown in Bastogne: Screaming Eagles Under Siege 18-27 Dec '44, It Never Snows, and Day of Days: The Invasion of Normandy 1944.&#10;&#10;Scenarios (4 scenarios total, 2 one-map scenarios):&#10;&#10;    Panzer Battles Campaign, 2 maps and 7 turns.&#10;    Containment Battles, 2 maps and 6 turns.&#10;    State Farm 79, 1 map and 2 turns.&#10;    &quot;I'll be back&quot;, 1 map and 2 turns.&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 2-3 days&#10;Hex: 547 yards / 500 meters&#10;Units: Company to Regiment&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;Two 22 x 34&quot; full color map&#10;One dual-side printed countersheet (280 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 8-page SCS version 1.8 system rulebook&#10;One 12-page Panzer Battles specific rulebook&#10;Two 6-sided dice&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: Medium&#10;Complexity Level: Medium&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 2-10 hours&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Football Strategy boils the sport down to play calling skill. The game's structure is simple: The defensive player selects one of 10 formation cards (ranging from an 8-man line &quot;goal line stand&quot; to a pass prevent defense with five safeties); the offensive player calls a play (a choice of 20, plus punting). Cross-indexing the choices on a matrix shows what happened. Except for &quot;long gains&quot;, the outcome of each play against each defense is always the same. Dice are rolled only to determine the distance of long gains and the results of kickoffs and field goal attempts.&#10;&#10;Each play consumes a prescribed number of seconds, from 15 to 45. The players mark off the time and play four quarters, following the standard football rules.&#10;&#10;For variety, three types of offense (&quot;pro style&quot;, &quot;aerial game&quot; and &quot;ball control&quot;) are available, each with a different, though not radically different, results matrix.&#10;&#10;Simple though it is, the game is engrossing (see the &quot;More Information&quot; screen), and play generally follows realistic patterns, though the handling of punts and on-side kicks (both more effective than in real life) is questionable. Also, because the design changed little after its debut in 1959, the plays and defenses don't reflect the state of the art in contemporary professional football. This is the era of Otto Graham, not Eli Manning.&#10;&#10;For those who are so inclined, Football Strategy lends itself to mathematical analysis. Many years ago, an entrant into the tournament at Origins went to the trouble of using game theory to generate charts showing the optimal mix of plays in different situations. He reached the finals but, in a victory for human intuition over number crunching, lost the championship game by a touchdown and a field goal.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "PQ-17 is a 2-player game of World War II air-naval operations in the Barents and Norwegian Seas, where the Allied player strives to pass convoys to and from north Russia in the face of appalling weather and determined opposition from his Axis opponent. PQ-17 highlights the impact of reconnaissance, fuel, and the extreme climate without the drawbacks of a double-blind system or tedious bookkeeping.&#10;&#10;Each of the 1&quot; square ship counters in the game depicts an individual capital ship or cruiser or a group of smaller ships, submarines, or merchant vessels. Virtually every vessel that sailed arctic waters in 1942 is included, along with others that fought (or might have) in key actions. Counters are formatted much like the units in traditional block wargames, allowing step reduction to show damage or reduced numbers without cumbersome markers or rosters. These large counters never appear on the map, however; they remain off-map on players' Task Force Displays until battle is joined.&#10;&#10;Instead, players maneuver blocks on a mapboard stretching from Greenland and Ireland to Kiel and the Kara Sea. Each block is a force of submarines or surface ships, its identity hidden from the enemy player until it is located by a successful search and the block is turned up. It may represent one ship or one hundred - or none at all, as it may be a dummy. Reconnaissance is critical, as you must locate the enemy in order to attack him. Cards are used to resolve searches quickly and efficiently: a successful search yields intelligence of varying accuracy, while failure to relocate the enemy in a timely manner results in lost contact and generation of another dummy.&#10;&#10;Players must also cope with fuel restrictions, reflecting limited endurance (particularly for destroyers) and Axis shortages. Simple rules and the use of markers on the Task Force Displays preclude the need for record keeping while preventing unrealistic freedom of action.&#10;&#10;To show the key role of air power in the campaign, PQ-17 also includes over 100 air units. Circular counters represent RAF Coastal Command and Fleet Air Arm squadrons and Luftwaffe Staffeln and Gruppen that participated in naval operations in the theater, as well as selected air defense units. Many VVS air regiments are also included, along with the USAAF squadrons that defended Iceland.&#10;&#10;Because the focus of the game is operational, battles are fought on an abstract Combat Display. Simple procedures and multiple Combat Results Tables reproduce historical levels of damage from all forms of combat: submarine attacks, antisubmarine warfare, bombing and aerial torpedo attacks, anti-aircraft fire, air-to-air combat, and naval surface actions.&#10;&#10;PQ-17's environmental model is based upon historical meteorological and oceanographic records to accurately reflect the extreme conditions and their effects. Summer operations, conducted in round-the-clock daylight, play much differently than those undertaken in the near-total darkness of winter. The polar ice pack advances and ebbs with the seasons, varying the sea routes available and posing a hazard for naval forces venturing too close. And besides each other, players must also battle some of the worst weather in the world, potentially damaging their ships and affecting movement, searches, and combat.&#10;&#10;PQ-17 features nine historical scenarios, including all the major actions of the campaign: the Fleet Air Arm torpedo attack on Tirpitz, the decimation of convoy PQ-17, the climactic battle of PQ-18, the Battle of the Barents Sea, and the 1943 Battle of North Cape. To add uncertainty, each side is subject to a special condition in every operation, which may impose additional requirements or restrictions - or afford additional opportunities - while remaining secret from the opponent. Just like their historical counterparts, Allied players can never be certain that the Germans will not attempt to break out into the Atlantic with one or more heavy ships, and Axis players must beware of a possible attack on Norway; both players may face conflicting priorities and demands that must be met with limited resources. In addition, a 1942 &quot;random&quot; scenario enhances replay value by further disguising starting forces and objectives. Each operational scenario can be played to conclusion in 3-4 hours, and for players seeking a richer experience, a 1942 campaign scenario reflects the challenges of continuing operations over the course of this key year.&#10;&#10;",

Alternatively, you can play as the terrorists, fighting for a world without empires.&#10;&#10;Everyone starts the game as an Empire, with a couple of free villages and they can settle anywhere in the world. Although peaceful (we had to ban fighting in the first round) the 'politics' of the game already start to form, depending on what oil is discovered and how 'aggressive' the initial settlement choice is.&#10;&#10;Empires then spread over the planet grabbing all available land, searching for the best oil and the most strategic borders. Some go for towns and cities, other spend their cash on extra empire cards, building up their political options. Maybe, if they're lucky, they'll get an early nuke.&#10;&#10;Sooner or later someone takes a pop. Maybe the Axis of Evil has declared an Empire evil, giving them a few terrorist cards which are just too tempting not to play. Maybe someone is looking too strong already. Maybe you've got a grudge from a previous game or maybe you just want to win. Either way, war is declared or the terrorists strike!&#10;&#10;Although it is possible to win the game with all the players still playing as Empires, the more likely outcome is that Empires are destroyed, bankrupted, or simply cave in and become terrorist players. As more empires fall they work together as a single terrorist player. With each new influx of terrorist cards and cash for the terrorist cause, the remaining Empires begin to wish that maybe they shouldn't have funded quite so much terrorism as they did.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "from MMP's website:&#10;&#10;In September of 1862 after months of uninterrupted and spectacular successes, Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virgina was poised to win the war.&#10;&#10;Lee has beaten back McClellan's Army of the Potomac from the gates of Richmond, routed Pope's Army of Virginia, and built a reputation of invincibility.&#10;&#10;Meanwhile, Lincoln had already penned the Emancipation Proclamation which would recast the war from one of a political disagreement over Federal control to a moral crusade which just could not be argued away. He just needed a victory to cast the entire war in an a new strategic light.&#10;&#10;All could very well be decided by what happens in the western part of Maryland over a few days.&#10;&#10;McClellan fought Lee's army back to the banks of the Antietam creek near the town of Sharpsburg. There both armies stood to fight the bloodiest single day battle in American history. The final decision is in your hands.&#10;&#10;None but Heroes is a game about that terrible day. Players tackle each other head-on. Can you do better than McClellan? Can you fight McClellan off like Lee? The stakes couldn't be higher!&#10;&#10;None but Heroes is the first game in the new Line of Battle Series. While drawing on the lessons of over 20 years of ACW design work of its two ancestor series, LoB represents the next generation of ACW game design. No stone was left unturned in making this system the best gaming experience possible. All the unit rosters and paperwork that interfered with the fighting is gone. The typical (and time consuming) multiple fire phases have all been integrated into movement so the action is non-stop.&#10;&#10;For the first time, the rat fight feel of the ACW open battlefield comes alive. The historical units (generally regiments of infantry and batteries of cannon) actually show the combined arms interactions and tactics available at the time. Old hands will see the history in a new light as they explore the implications of more recent research.&#10;&#10;Representing many years of original research, the game contains information not available anywhere else regarding the strength, equipment, location, capabilities, and order of battle of both armies. Extensive historical notes layout just some of the myriad of details included in the units, scenarios, and map.&#10;&#10;As one small example, it explores the frequently overlooked &quot;Green&quot; units at the battle (units which have been in the army for a few weeks or even less). The Green units will make you look at McClellan's strength in a whole new way. This is a level of &quot;greenness&quot; well beyond the usual sense of &quot;not having been in combat, yet&quot;. These are enthusiastic men, but some of whom have not yet been taught to load their muskets.&#10;&#10;The Union player is only mildly inhibited by his McClellan persona; you can try a lot of different approaches to cutting the Rebels down to size. You are equipped with the same heavy guns and infantry with just as much grit and determination as he was.&#10;&#10;The Confederate player will need to use his thin forces wisely, but cannot fail to counterattack as needed to blunt Union advances. You must use your troop's elan to make up for their limited numbers.&#10;&#10;The game features four two-map scenarios which allow players to pick up the action at various times during the day and the morning of the next. The ability to start play the day after the battle allows players a chance to explore the options available on that day.

Each player's deck starts with the following cards: seven Genius Waves cards that give you Power, one Beth, one Jerry, and one Summer. The Beth, Jerry, and Summer cards do nothing, but can activate other cards. The &quot;Kick&quot; stack in other Cerberus games is now the Portal Gun stack. The Portal Gun activates the Portal deck, which transports a player's hero to a random location from the episode or other popular places from the series. That player may then utilize that location during their turn and has the option of paying the cost of the location to put it into their deck.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Each game is made up of rounds. A round begins with all players playing one card from their hands and placing it face down on the table. Then, all cards are exposed simultaneously.&#10;&#10;There are 66 City Cards and each carry a name of a city along with a number value (ranging from 2 to 7). Since the trains begin their expansion from the easternmost part of the board, the farther west the city, the higher its number value. Players score points only for City Cards that are played and placed face up. Cards that remain unplayed in hands have no value. The numerical value of a City Card is multiplied by the number of railroads connected to it.&#10;&#10;Players may also play a Double turn Card, a combination of a City Card with a Branch Line card or a combination of a Double Turn Card and a Branch Line Card.&#10;&#10;A Double Turn Card allows a player to place two pieces of track in both track phases of a turn (although only one piece of track may be placed if desired). Furthermore, all bonuses are doubled during the round that card is played.&#10;&#10;Each Railroad has two Branch Line Cards and a player may pay $1 and draw one of them. (Players may only hold one Branch Line Card in their hands at any one time.) If held, the Branch Line Card must be played immediately on the next round in conjunction with either a City or Double Turn Card.&#10;&#10;Play of a Branch Line Card allows a player to start a new route of track for the named railroad from any city that railroad connects, thereby extending the railroad.&#10;&#10;After exposing a card, the round continues with two turns of laying track. Players do not control any specific rail line. Each player can place track on any color provided that the played track connects to an existing corresponding rail network on the board. Once all track is placed, all players replenish their hands (up to five cards). The First Player passes the First Player Train to the player on the left (who becomes the First Player for the subsequent round) and the next round begins.&#10;&#10;The first player to connect the first railroad to any city earns $2. Certain cities are marked with colored squares (matching the colors of certain railroads). Should a corresponding color railroad enter that city, the player making that connection gets a bonus of $4. Double Turn Cards double all bonuses in a round.&#10;&#10;When all track pieces of all the railroads have been played or if a player is unable to play any piece of track because all playable railroads are &quot;dead-ended&quot;, the game ends and points are tallied.&#10;&#10;Points are received in two ways. First, players receive 1 point for each $1 they have. Second, each City Card is worth its value times the number of different rail lines connected to it. The player with the highest total wins! (In case of a tie, the player with the most City Cards valued at &quot;7&quot; is declared the victor.)&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "From the publisher:&#10;&#10;Early in the morning on 20 May 1941, as 30,000 Commonwealth soldiers on Crete were finishing breakfast, hundreds of German transport aircraft&mdash;some towing gliders&mdash;rumbled over the Mediterranean island. The air above was suddenly filled with parachutes as thousands of elite German paratroops&mdash;Fallschirmj&auml;ger&mdash;descended from the sky.&#10;&#10;The invasion of Crete was one of the most dramatic battles of the Second World War. Over a nine-day period in May 1941, a mixed force of Commonwealth and Greek troops desperately tried to fight off the German assault. Despite appalling casualties, the paratroopers and glider-borne troops managed to secure a foothold and the critical Maleme Airfield to open the door for the German Gebirgsj&auml;ger (mountain troops) to land under fire. Together the Fallschirmj&auml;ger and Gebirgsj&auml;ger pushed the Commonwealth troops to their breaking point and forced a deadly battle of delay and pursuit.&#10;&#10;This was a true soldier&rsquo;s battle, with both sides in desperate situations often lacking higher-level control and support. The Germans had to quickly secure a usable airfield or face the annihilation of their entire airborne force. The Commonwealth needed to crush the German landings or&mdash;failing that&mdash;evacuate the bulk of its forces to continue the fight in North Africa and Syria.&#10;&#10;The German invasion of Crete in May 1941 stands as a landmark in the history of airborne warfare. Up until that point, airborne operations were tactical operations to seize key objectives in advance of the ground forces. The German invasion of Crete (codenamed Operation Merkur) was the first strategic airborne operation.&#10;&#10;Although casualties would mean Crete was the last hurrah for the German airborne in a major air assault, it set the stage for even larger future Allied airborne operations in the Mediterranean, Western Europe, and Asia.&#10;&#10;Operation Mercury maintains the same level of detail and scale as other Grand Tactical Series (GTS) games. Players command divisions and maneuver company-sized units to fight one of the most desperate battles of the war. Using the GTS 2.0 rules, Operation Mercury offers two players or teams a wide range of scenarios ranging from a single small map with a few units on each side to the full battle including up to two German divisions and several Commonwealth and Greek brigades. Operation Mercury covers all the major airdrops and fighting across the island from Heraklion in the east, through Rethymnon, and from Maleme to Suda Bay then south to the Askifou Plain, scene of the last major fight during the withdrawal.&#10;&#10;As the Commander of Allied forces on Crete, can you deny the Germans a precious airfield and negate their much-needed air-landing reinforcements for a quick victory? Of all operations of war, a withdrawal under heavy enemy pressure is probably the most difficult and perilous. Can you get the bulk of your forces to the southern evacuation ports? As the German, how quickly can you force the collapse of the Commonwealth morale and trigger their withdrawal?&#10;&#10;Features include:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Shifting Allied morale state based on relative casualties and key events, which can trigger evacuation and end-game victory conditions.&#10;     Random events, including tank breakdowns, misdirected airstrikes, and partisan attacks.&#10;     An option for Commonwealth naval support at the risk of losing precious ships to German air attacks.&#10;&#10;&#10;Thirteen scenarios include:&#10;&#10;     Separate one-map battles for the airdrops at Rethymnon, Heraklion, and the Maleme/Canea sector.&#10;     A one-map battle for the New Zealand counter-attack to retake Maleme airfield.&#10;     One-, two-, and three-map battles for the difficult German advance and Commonwealth delay and withdrawal.&#10;     The full campaign on all five maps or just the main event from Maleme to Askifou Plain on three maps.&#10;     Hypothetical German precision drops as well as a German free drop scenario.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

As recruits of the IPA, i.e. the Interplanetary Alliance, the players experience an extraordinary story full of action and adventure and have to steer their own spaceship, with the fan turning into a jet engine, the blinds into a protective shield, the bookshelf into a diplomatic database, and much more!&#10;&#10;In Spaceship Unity &ndash; Season 1.1, the focus is on the story. As in a TV series, the story continues over several episodes (five in this case). Each of them is divided into multiple chapters with branching story paths for a different experience. As in real life, the story keeps going no matter how the crew performs. However, that doesn't mean the mission is to be taken lightly! After all, the players are the last hope for galactic peace, and the course of the story will change depending on the players' success or lack thereof, for better or for worse.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

BlackSheep is perfect for two to four players ages eight and up. -From the FFG website.&#10;&#10;There's a lot of randomness here, but also room for elementary strategy.  Players make poker hands from two shared cards (figurines of ranked animals) and three of their own (these are actual cards).  There are three such hands playing simultaneously, with players adding one or two cards at a time to any hand on their turn.  When all players have played three cards onto a hand, a winner is chosen, based on the poker ranks.  The winner takes the two shared cards (animal figurines), and new shared cards are added.  At the end of the game, scores are calculated by summing numbers printed on the bottoms of the figurines they captured and some bonuses.  The black sheep figurines are worth negative points.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Battle for Stalingrad is a battalion/company level simulation for two Players of the critical World War II battle for the renowned Russian City on the Volga River. The conflict raged for seven weeks in late 1942. Elements of fourteen German divisions of the Sixth Army and Fourth Panzer Army engaged dozens of divisions and brigades of the Soviet 62nd Army in one of the bloodiest campaigns of the war.&#10;&#10;Battle for Stalingrad uses a game-system of German action and Soviet reaction, highlighting the differences in command and tactics employed by the Germans and Soviets at the time. The Ger-mans enjoyed superior application of their air power and artillery. Their efficient communications and command structure, under General Friedrich von Paulus, allowed them to maintain complete initiative in the battle until they were well into the built-up areas of Stalingrad itself. The Soviets, on the other hand, had poor communications among their forces. Lieutenant-General Vasili Chuikov was hard pressed to maintain com-mand of his army, even in the most critical areas of the city. The campaign was finally decided among the burnt out blocks of the dying metropolis, where the Soviets proved themselves masters of urban combat and the German drive to the East was halted.&#10;&#10;1980 SPI Version Components;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 1 week&#10;Hex: 656 yards / 600 meters&#10;Units: Company to Regiment&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 22 x 34&quot; full color map&#10;Two dual-side printed countersheet (One sheet with 400 1/2&quot; counters and one sheet with 200 1/2&quot; counters))&#10;One 32-page rulebook&#10;One 22.25 x 29&quot; Player Aid Sheet (Setup &amp; Reinforcements)&#10;Two 6 sided Dice&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: High&#10;Complexity Level: Medium-High&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 4-15 hours&#10;&#10;2011 Excalibre Version;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 1 week&#10;Hex: 656 yards / 600 meters&#10;Units: Company to Regiment&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 22 x 34&quot; full color map&#10;Three dual-side printed countersheet (two sheets with 280 1/2&quot; counters and one sheet with 40 1/2&quot; counters))&#10;One 54-page rulebook&#10;One 32-page rules supplement &amp; game analysis booklet&#10;One 17 x 20&quot; Deployment Display Chart&#10;One 14 x 22&quot; Reinforcement Display Chart&#10;Two 6 sided Dice&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: High&#10;Complexity Level: Medium-High&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 4-15 hours&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Think Str8! is about estimating, guessing and making clever deductions! Each player has six numbers in different colors in front of them. They can see the numbers of all the other players, but unfortunately, they see only the back of their own display. Who will manage to figure out through deduction what is standing in front of them?&#10;&#10;In more detail, the game includes cards in six colors, with each color having numbers 0-7. One card of each color is randomly removed from play and returned to the box without anyone knowing the numbers on those cards. Each player then sets up a rack with one card of each color on it, but with the racks facing toward the other players so that no one sees the numbers on their own rack. (In a game with two or three players, set up two or one additional racks visible to all players.)&#10;&#10;On a round, the active player rolls the three color dice, e.g., blue, red, and yellow. Each player tries to guess what the sum of the numbers on their rack is for the cards that correspond to the die colors. If the dice showed two green and one grey, for example, you'd add the green number twice and the grey number once &mdash; but of course you can't see what your numbers are; you can only see what they aren't based on what's showing in the racks visible to you.&#10;&#10;The active player then takes one of the bid strips &mdash; seven cardboard strips that come in different lengths &mdash; and places it across one or more numbers on the number line in front of them to show the range in which their sum lies, e.g., 13-16. Each other player does the same, choosing from the strips not previously chosen. If you guess correctly, you score points, with shorter strips being worth more points; if you're wrong, then you must discard any one of your colored cards face up, then draw a new card of this color and place it in your rack unseen. You now see this hidden number, which may help you deduce sums from previous rounds, but now you have to start over with you deductions for that color! Other players see the new card you just placed, so they get more info, too.&#10;&#10;After 8-10 rounds, depending on the number of players, each player guesses the numbers on their racks, writing down one, two, or three guesses for each color. If you guess correctly, you score 5, 2, or 1 points for a color based on how many guesses you wrote. Add these points to whatever you scored previously, and whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Reiner Knizia has designed a number of games set in Ancient Rome. This collection brings together three of the finest, covering three very different aspects of the Roman Empire: Hannibal versus Rome, Imperium and Circus Maximus.&#10;&#10;Hannibal versus Rome is a 30-minute two-player game depicing the initial struggle for supremacy between Rome and Carthage, which finally established Rome as the leading power in the Mediterranean. It draws on the events of the Second Punic War, during which Hannibal crossed the Alps with his elephants, and defeated Rome in the battle of Cannae. The Roman general Scipio succeeded in moving the fighting away from Italy, into Spain and Africa, where he defeated the Carthaginians at Zama.&#10;&#10;The map covers the Western Mediterranean. Players move Legions and Fleets, deciding conflicts by the use of cards in order to determine who will be the dominant power in the Mediterranean region.&#10;&#10;Imperium (a game for two to five players) focuses on Rome's political and territorial expansion during the Imperial period. Powerful families controlled the individual provinces in order to increase their wealth and power in Rome, until the Roman Empire reached its zenith in size in the year 100 under the Emperor Trajan.&#10;&#10;In each round the two to five players distribute markers onto areas of the Empire, with control of one area being decided each round. The players need to have the right influence at the decisive moment to take control, without neglecting long-term development. It is a game of planning and timing.&#10;&#10;Circus Maximus leads us into the heart of Rome itself with its renowned public entertainment for the masses; chariot racing.&#10;&#10;Chariot races were immensely popular in Rome. The Circus Maximus offered room for 200,000 spectators who avidly followed the races, roaring and cheering on their favourites. The courageous charioteers were divided into teams distinguished by different colours. The most successful were worshipped as heroes, but the risks were high and many paid for their fame and daring with their lives.&#10;&#10;Each of two to five players controls a team of three chariots. In a game of pure tactics, players receive five movement cards that they can assign each turn to individual chariots as they wish. The first to bring all three across the finish line wins the game and the laurel wreath.&#10;&#10;Note: the 3 games in this were previously released in Neue Spiele im alten Rom.&#10;&#10;",

Stout Heroes of the land, mighty warriors and dexterous thieves, pious paladins and wily wizards, have banded together to bust down your gates and evict you from your dark castle.&#10;&#10;Luckily, you are in contact with Dark Masters, beings man was not meant to know. They are ready to provide you dastardly traps, potent spells, and decaying corpses for reanimation, if you can demonstrate your bravery by facing the toughest Heroes.&#10;&#10;Now it&rsquo;s a competition to see which Overlord can withstand the siege. Well... you never liked your neighbors that much anyway.&#10;&#10;Dark Dealings is a quick drafting and combat game for 1-6 players.  You first draft Heroes, then use them to bid for the Defenses that will eventually be their downfall. Players then take turns flipping and fighting their previously drafted Heroes. The last Overlord standing is the winner!&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "The third in the Historic Epic Battle System series of games.&#10;&#10;Relive the legendary Battle of Waterloo!&#10;&#10;18th June 1815, Napoleon Bonaparte is determined to rise back to power and claim all of Europe as his prize, but is stopped in his tracks by the might of the forces led by an unassuming yet undefeated Arthur Wellesley and his charismatic Prussian ally Bl&uuml;cher.&#10;&#10;1815, Scum of the Earth is an asymmetric, competitive, tactical card game, and successor to the award-winning 1066, Tears to Many Mothers (and 1565, St. Elmo's Pay), with which it is fully compatible. Each player, as either the Duke of Wellington or Napoleon, musters troops and resources to overcome the various obstacles in their path before their armies clash in an epic battle over three farms forward of the ridge at Waterloo: Hougoumont, La Haye Sainte, and Papelotte.&#10;&#10;Every beautiful card in the game is inspired by a real person or event from the time. With a focus on quick, tactical play and a thematic re-imagining of the events of the time, the game is non-collectable, and there is no deck building required. Each player simply grabs their deck and shuffles, then play begins.&#10;&#10;Note on title: Though not an accurate description of their formidable fighting prowess, Wellington himself referred to his men on more than one occasion as Scum of the Earth. &ldquo;The French system of conscription brings together a fair sample of all classes; ours is composed of the scum of the earth&mdash;the mere scum of the earth. It is only wonderful that we should be able to make so much out of them afterwards.&rdquo; &ndash; &lsquo;Notes of conversations with the Duke of Wellington, 1831-1851&rsquo; by Philip Henry, 5th Earl Stanhope&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

They add cubes on their personal board and try to arrange them as best as possible in order to score the most victory points. Each cube represents a different type of module. Flats, shops, offices, generators, lifts, car parks, town hall can be built and stacked during the course of the game. Each module generates influence on adjacent land and on cubes directly below or above.&#10;&#10;Each round, players will gain two cubes of different colors through a non-random mechanism, build them on their game board, then eventually stack them in order to make towers according to the building rules. If the players have done their job well, some modules will be able to evolve, becoming bigger in three dimensions. The last phase is an income phase in which players gain money from the shops and parking lots if they are supplied with electricity.&#10;&#10;The bigger and higher your city is, the more victory points players will have at the end of the game, which lasts ten rounds &ndash; but do not forget to provide electricity to all your flats, shops, and lifts to make them more efficient.&#10;&#10;Town Center is the second title in designer Alban Viard's &quot;Small City&quot; trilogy, Card City being the first.&#10;&#10;",

You play the monarchist Coalitions, led by Britain, and the game's A.I. plays Napoleonic France.&#10;&#10;The game is grand-strategic; each turn covers an average of two years' real time. Your goal is to force Napoleon to abdicate, through a combination of military defeats in Europe (using your armies), and military/diplomatic defeats overseas (spending cash and diplomatic assets in a series of semi-random overseas campaigns including Ireland, Egypt, the Balkans, Senegal and the War of 1812). At the end of Turn 16 (1818-1821), if you have not defeated Napoleon, then Napoleon dies of natural causes and an exhausted Europe makes peace with his son, and you lose the game.&#10;&#10;As a solitaire game, it is full of random events and unexpected challenges for the player, as you -- the British -- attempt to hold your unwieldy coalition together and prioritize your various budgets to win naval battles, overseas campaigns, and subsidize the various minor states of Europe whose armies are key to victory.&#10;&#10;",
