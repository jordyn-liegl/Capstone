    "description": "Dungeons are full of treasures, and some people return from them covered in glory, gems, and gold nuggets. More common, however, are the ones who died inside! You are obviously tempted by the chance to enrich yourself, but you don't want to be one of those who won't see the sun again. Luckily there are always many idiots lingering in inns who you can trick by promising glory and money, brave heroes ready to enter the deep caves occupied by terrible monsters and risk not coming back with their arms full of treasure.&#10;&#10;In Dungeon Heroes Manager, you are sponsors of the &quot;dungeon cleaning operations&quot; in the kingdom. Thanks to public funds (you obviously don't want to risk your own money), you will hire cannon fodder, er, brave heroes in the local inns, equip and train them, then send them toward castles and caves to loot them and clean up of dangerous monsters &mdash; all in order to get richer shamelessly.&#10;&#10;But note that Dungeon Heroes Manager is a game in which the richest &mdash; and not the bravest &mdash; hero will win!&#10;&#10;",

Over the course of the season, the standings of each club in the league is tracked to see who wins the championship.  Provisions are included in the game for injuries and star performances to occur, and mechanics are included for rookie players to be created.

However, judge not! In this game you have to take the right tricks at strategic times to get yourself into the best position each round. With a double-edged-sword resource collection element, Gone Viking elevates itself as a uniquely competitive game, and one that reminds players of what it was like to be a viking raider.&#10;&#10;In more detail, each round players receive a hand of cards, with the leader then swapping up to four cards for free. After trump is declared, all players can pay to swap cards. As players win tricks, they can plunder resource tokens that are used to win the game. During the trick-taking phase, players can add multiple cards together to increase their total and play viking god cards to use those special powers. The last standing viking god in a round provides an additional benefit to its owner, and the richest player in a round will find half his wealth taken by Jarl &mdash; so aim for second place in order to keep your goods.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Lorrein is published by Sensalot in 2011. The Duces of Lorrein is a family game with a nice mix of existing and new game elements. It contains a new invented alternative to dice.&#10;&#10;Goal of the game is to complete you mission card which states to build 4 specified workshops (Mill, Saw Mill, Stone Mill, Tannery (leather)). You start with just 1.&#10;&#10;Turn sequence:&#10;1) Each player throws the chancebowl and gets raw materials (Wood, rock, animal, grain, lavender)(wooden pieces). &#10;2)The raw material has to be processed in a workshop in order to become a useful product (product cards). Because the other players have the other workshops you'll have to negotiate with them to get you material processed. This makes players dependent of each other. With the product card a player can build a workshop, farm, castle, big castle or a witchery.&#10;3)The final step is paying food for each castle. If a player doesn't have enough food, a game piece has to be taken away.&#10;&#10;The winner is the player that completes his turn and mission card.&#10;&#10;What makes the game interesting is the dilemma of being mutually dependent of your co player. Meanwhile each player wants to become independent by building your own workshops. For this you first need to negotiate with your co players. Becoming independent is often not on the road to completing you mission. So should you remain dependent and try to reach you goal asap, while running the risk of being blocked in the end, or should you try to become independent first and strong en your influence.&#10;Another element of influence in the game is the Mill. There is only one mill in the game. If someone else builds the mill, you lose it. Having the mill means controlling the food. You can use this position to get extra income or by starving and deterioration you opponents. Partner or Compete.&#10;&#10;Another element is the game of positioning:  &#10;A workshop has to border a Castle. A small castle can have 2 workshops and a big castle can have 4 workshops. The castle has to be positioned between the 4 8-sided landscapes. Getting a good position with the correct landscapes around your castle is important. However, you opponents can block you by building farms, witchery or a workshop adjacent to your castle.&#10;&#10;As an extra the game contains two additions in the manual which will strongly change the game. The first addition is the option to steal a farm if it isn't protected by an own castle or witchery. The second addition is to steal workshop by building a stronger castle.&#10;&#10;All in all a very good balanced game, with a lot of dynamic and a great replayability.&#10;&#10;",

Players have to provision barrels, as well as roll dice and move accordingly, and when they reach the coats, can spy through their telescopes. This is a clever mechanism, with several discs showing different views of land being turned face down. When a player wants to look, it reveals one to see what can be seen.&#10;&#10;The plastic ships can also suffer damage and even have their mast broken (plucked off the piece). When a player succeeds in discovery, it must sail back to Spain and deliver the message to win.&#10;&#10;A popular and attractive game, fun with enough variation to keep players amused.&#10;&#10;",

Each mobster player receives money from his speakeasy and attempts to pull big jobs, hijack other players' loot and send out &quot;hit men&quot; to even up old scores. As the police commissioner, players have to stop crime as thrilling high speed chases find mobsters using second cars to run through police road blocks and &quot;choppers&quot; to knock police cars out of the chase. Or, the police commissioner can turn &quot;crooked&quot; and take bribes and make deals with the mobster players. It's all part of the fun and excitement in this game that allows you to relive that famous part of history known as the Roaring Twenties!&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "From the publisher:&#10;&#10;You receive a mysterious letter from a distant Uncle Alfredeus &quot;Alphie&quot; Maleficus asking for your presence at a family meeting at his Victorian mansion. As you arrive, you discover you are not alone. Some people are family you recognize, others you don't. The door opens and you all enter. The door locks behind you. A spectral form of Alphie greets you and informs you he is stuck in an interplanar portal. He needs your help to be saved. All you have to do is make your way through his mansion to his laboratory and pull him out. He promises to share his wealth and knowledge with whomever among you can reach him first.&#10;&#10;The Mansion of Mana is a sequential set collection, unique power, engine building light-strategic game with a modular game board. In the Mansion of Mana, each player represents a distant relative of Uncle Alphie who are attempting to earn their fortune and knowledge by helping to save him. Players navigate the mansion- collecting runic elements, playing them sequentially to acquire keys, to enter new rooms in the mansion. With each room entered, a new ability is gained allowing each player to become quicker at acquiring the runes to enter more rooms or to slow others down who would beat you to the objective of saving Uncle Alphie.&#10;&#10;The Mansion of Mana gives players a medium to light weight strategic game in a small box. Player's seek to get through the mansion as quickly as possible while engine-building their special abilities to gain more cards, hold more cards, add more options, steal from other players, or allow them to bend the rules in their favor. The Mansion of Mana is strongly strategic with the only elements of luck in the cards available to draw from (similar to Ticket to Ride). However, every player has a hand limit, so you cannot save up your cards, but you can play them on the table, partially completed, and add to them. However, watch out! Someone could steal from your partially completed set.&#10;&#10;Will you efficiently navigate the Mansion? or will you prey off of those who would be so careless to leave their runes in the open? Or perhaps you will Unlock the secrets of the mansion to find your way to Uncle Alphie and achieve victory!&#10;&#10;",

Each player has a hand of five tribe cards (from a set of eight), and going clockwise from the chief, each player lays down a tribe card in front of one of the solo challenges.

A challenge might have you setting jacks on edge, throwing a jack over a wall formed by your other hand, move jacks from the table into your other hand, and so on. If at any time, you fail to catch your jack, your turn ends &mdash; although you can twice discard a tribe card from your hand to replay the challenge. If you succeed, you keep the tribe card you played.&#10;&#10;In a duel, the first player to complete the duel keeps one of the two tribe cards played.&#10;&#10;After all solo and duel challenges are complete, everyone participates in a final challenge to determine who will be chief for the next round.

However, Remmi Demmi changes the game slightly by adding another characteristic to the cards, so each card can either categorized by color or the position of the figure on the card.  The object of the game is still basically the same (collect a full set), but you can either collect figures or colors.  In addition, each hand is played with a variable time limit, as the dealer gets to play either a quick hand (he thinks he can get the Remmi quickly), or a longer hand.  Either way, the first set (Remmi) gets the most points, with those that follow getting less or none.&#10;&#10;",

Here's more about the two characters in this game from the publisher:&#10;&#10;&quot;Atop his noble steed, this handsome prince is every girl's dream...or is he your worst nightmare? It should be easy for Prince Charming to defeat a young boy, except that Hansel has an equally sinister sister, Gretel, and together they form an eerily unstoppable duo. It will take all of their tricks to win control of the Kingdom, but who will be victorious?&quot;&#10;&#10;The setting for Scary Tales is a kingdom, where a battle awaits as the king has died, leaving no heir. While the enchanted forest is feared and the castle is covered in dark clouds, corruption has affected the town and only those with the utmost abilities in Strength, Wisdom, Magic and Luck will be able to collect enough relics from the stories of long ago to prove themselves worthy of being the new leader. The challengers are sharp, indomitable, and devious - and with each match-up, it is uncertain who will win the crown.&#10;&#10;Each character comes with its own unique ability which may be used once per game and a color coded set of dice. A set of power cards and fortune cards, a fairy card and a die associated with said fairy comprise the contents of the game. To win, a player needs to obtain seven points worth of relics, and hold on to them until the beginning of their next turn.&#10;&#10;",

The poker-chip sized pieces, embossed with scorpions, also stack neatly onto the impressively designed and attractive playing surface.&#10;&#10;The race starts with players entering their pieces onto the yellow track. After 18 spaces, when the end of the initial S has been reached, players double-back on themselves, taking the black track to return home. The twist lies in &#10;that a scorpion may &quot;sting&quot; another, not just by landing on the same space, but also by landing on an adjacent space on the other coloured track. This enables a player to hinder opponents or to boost his own position by switching scorpions onto the other track.&#10;&#10;Unfortunately, the rather minimalist rules supplied do not cover every gameplay eventuality. In particular, the knock-on effect that occurs frequently on a congested board, where a &quot;stung&quot; scorpion may inadvertently sting another is not explained in a satisfactory manner.&#10;&#10;",

A few modifications were made to adjust to the lack of a computer.&#10;&#10;Players play on a 4x4 grid (play mat provided), with some spaces randomly blocked out during set-up by special extra cards.&#10;&#10;Each card has a set of arrows, and a set of attributes.  The arrows point at one of the adjacent cards in the grid (four sides and four diagonals)  An arrow may be present or not, each card has a unique combination of arrows.  The attributes are: an attack value, whether the attack is physical or magical, and two defense values: one physical, and one magical.  There are a few other special cards.&#10;&#10;Cards are played from a hand onto the game grid, and marked with a chip indicating the player.  If the new card has an arrow pointing at an existing card, and that card has no arrow pointing back, the other card changes owners.  If opposing arrows occur, then the cards 'battle' using their attributes.  Combat is resolved by comparing the attributes, looking up the value in a table, and then rolling the indicated percentile.  Winning a combat can create a chain reaction of ownership changes, based on the card arrows.&#10;&#10;To my knowledge, the game was only published in Germany.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "From the Publisher: &#10;Tank Commander: The Eastern Front Edition is a collectible card game covering tactical combat on the Eastern Front during World War II. It can be played by two or more and includes a total of 164 different cards in three different rarities. Tank Commander is very simple to learn yet not simplistic to play. The Eastern Front Edition includes over 80 different tank models!&#10;&#10;The game is sold in Playing decks of 60 cards each. One Display Box contains 12 Tank Commander Playing Decks.&#10;&#10;The game is a simple tactical level card game of warfare with each card representing an individual tank, squad, gun and gun team, etc.  There are terrain cards representing all forms of terrain that can be used to build custom scenarios.  Also in the mix are special cards like minefields, Panzerfausts, Flank Shots, Snipers, Mine Dogs, Artillery barrages and counter barrages, air strikes, etc.  Even though this is a CCG, it plays well with a few starter decks.  Deck building is point based with a value assigned to each card so it's not necessarily to one's advantage to have a bunch of high value cards.  Also, the rarity mix in the set was supposedly based on the availability of the actual equipment in WWII on the East Front.  There are plenty of good common and uncommon cards that are best used to build a deck.&#10;&#10;A player's guide is also available with comprehensive rules, errata, advanced rules, optional rules, card lists and more scenarios.&#10;&#10;",

Money to build is earned by creating a rail network to cities, towns and mines, with the mining being rather abstract(mines open and close as random events). Players must worry about the details of track types, passes and tunnels. In addition, there is an events deck which has a large effect on play. As there are really only about three good ways through the mountains, this is the optimal number of players.&#10;&#10;In 1995 Winsome Games released Rocky Mountain Rails as an expansion kit to the game.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Rocky Mountain Rails&#10;&#10;&#10;",

After all, sometimes getting ahead in this world can be absolute murder!&#10;&#10;In game terms, you lead &quot;meetings&quot; where all players contribute a card, usually of the matching suit. The highest played card wins, but each meeting will have a &quot;killer suit&quot; that beats the leading suit. A scene card drawn for each meeting further complicates things, forcing players to always remain on their toes. In this merciless world of high finance, some players will be forced to draw murder cards, and eventually those bodies will start to pile up. Bodies are worth negative points &mdash; unless you happen to have collected the most, in which case they might actually help you secure your victory.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Players start with seven cards in hand while the rest of the cards are spread out, face down, on the table in front of them. Each card has one of six different animals or is a PAWS card. The goal of the game: Be the first to collect all seven cards of one animal and shout &quot;Got 'em!&quot;&#10;&#10;To start the game one player says &quot;Ready, set, go!&quot; and the game begins! Everyone plays at the same time. Player choose one card from their hand to play face up on the table and then may grab any other card, face up or down, to add to their hand. If a player plays the PAWS card, play stops and everyone passes three of their cards to the player on their right. The PAWS card is removed from the game and the player who used it shouts &quot;GO!&quot; to continue the game. First player to get all seven of one animal and shout &quot;Got 'em!&quot; wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Seega is a very old game of indeterminate age, which may have been a descendent of the Roman Latrunculi and, ultimately, related to the Hnefatafl family, as the &quot;sandwiching&quot; method of capture is identical.  Seega persists today in parts of North Africa. It is played on a 5x5 board (a &quot;Knights&quot; solitaire board is ideal for this) with each player having 12 pieces (usually marbles).  Players alternately place two of their pieces on the board until all spaces except one are occupied. No captures are made during this deployment phase. The player who placed the last pieces then moves one piece one space orthogonally, attempting to take opponent's pieces by custodial capture (i.e. &quot;sandwiching&quot;). A piece on the central square - usually marked with a cross - is safe from capture. If a player cannot make a legal move, their opponent continues to play until an opening appears. To win, reduce your opponent to one piece (or none). Draws often occur.   Variants are played on larger boards (8 x 8 etc.) and/or with different capturing conditions, such as jumping, as in draughts/checkers.&#10;&#10;",
