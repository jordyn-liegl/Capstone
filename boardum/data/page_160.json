    "description": "Modern War #15, Jan-Feb 2015&#10;&#10;Red Tide West: The Cold War &amp; World War III in Europe is a wargame that simulates a hypothetical Warsaw Pact invasion of West Germany in the late-1980&rsquo;s. Red Tide West also presumes a wider conflict beyond the scope of the game, but postulates West Germany to be the so-called &ldquo;center of gravity&rdquo; for the entire war. In other words, regardless of what is happening in, say, Scandinavia, or the Balkans, or the Middle East, etc., the presumption here is that the war will be won or lost in central Europe. To wit, if the Red Army cripples NATO and overruns West Germany, it is assumed that diplomatic negotiations will then suddenly become advantageous to both sides. For the Soviets, they would be satisfied to end the war with their substantial gains, not to mention the distinction of being regarded by the world as having won the war, especially if a nuclear exchange had not yet occurred. NATO, on the other hand (and especially the French) would want to end the war before the Red Army rolled into France proper, and certainly before a full-blown nuclear war erupted (or escalated further, if a limited nuclear exchange had already occurred).&#10;&#10;On the other side of the coin, if the Red Army&rsquo;s drive into West Germany is halted or thrown back, the war will have run its course then and there, regardless of what is happening elsewhere in the world. Negotiations would be underway, regardless, but the Soviets would have very little to gain (and actually much to lose) by perpetuating a war that is then being perceived as the ultimate reproach of the Soviet state and Communist ideology. Indeed, before Soviet battlefield defeats became prolific and pronounced, and especially before NATO units began to push across the borders of East Bloc countries, the Soviets would be confronted with a choice of trying to negotiate an end to the war before the Warsaw Pact alliance collapsed (or worse, defected&hellip;as if a widespread repeat of the Hungarian Uprising of &lsquo;56), or resort to nuclear strikes to avoid a total defeat (a decidedly undesirable solution when considering NATO&rsquo;s predictable response).&#10;&#10;In any case, Red Tide West presumes a short war whereby the final dispositions will be known within a matter of weeks. The Soviet timetables expected the Red Army to reach the French border within 15 days, and therefore the game excludes Soviet &ldquo;Category C&rdquo; and &ldquo;Category D&rdquo; reserves, which could not have been mobilized within the timeframe of the game&hellip; whether or not the Soviet timetables were realistic in the first place.&#10;&#10;The game includes two maps (22&quot;x34&rdquo;) and 560 counters.&#10;&#10;Design &amp; Development: Eric R.

There is a &lsquo;mysterious cloud&rsquo; - a plastic construction raised from the board on a central column - which moves about the board and twists around above the ships. There are magnets on the underside of the cloud and on top of the ships, so ships can be picked up and moved or destroyed when the cloud passes over.

    "description": "Sly Dice is a dice game in which you want to get as many points as possible by scoring various dice combinations. However, you can also bluff about having those combinations and hope that others will not call on you. At the end the player with the most points wins the game.&#10;&#10;Each player has three dice, a shield and tokens for marking. There are several combination cards in the middle of the table as well as three common dice that will be used by all players. In each round the starting player rolls the middle dice and then all players also have up to three rolls for their own dice, which are rolled behind player's shield. However, if you want to make a roll after your first one, you have to set one die aside, visible to other players. However, if you roll three times your last roll must remain behind the shield - thus each player will have at least one die that is not visible to others.&#10;&#10;When everyone is done with rolling, all players claim, which of the visible combinations they have. The trick is - you can also lie and try to claim a combination, which you don't have. When a player has claimed a combination then all other players in clockwise order have a chance to either accuse him of lying or pass.&#10;&#10;1) If everyone passes then the player scores this combination and receives the points it provides. If he lied and didn't have this combination he can now reveal this fact to others - he still scores the combination as if he had it and he also receives one Successful Liar's card, which gives extra points.&#10;&#10;2) If anyone accuses the player of lying, then he has to reveal his dice, which creates two possibilities:&#10;&#10;If he was not lying then he scores the combination, but the player who accused him takes a False Accusation card, which gives minus points. However, if he was lying then he was accused correctly and doesn't get to score the combination, effectively losing his turn. The accuser doesn't get anything apart from the good feeling that he didn't let the lie slip through.&#10;&#10;Thus each player in a round claims one combination. At the end of the round you add a new combination card from the draw pile and begin a new round. After certain number of rounds you tally up the score and the winner is the player with most points.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Dive! Diver! Die! (D3) is a treasure diving game of sneaky planning, risk-taking and mayhem fun. The game is played over four nerve-wrecking diving expeditions.&#10;&#10;For each expedition, players have to plan the amount of oxygen they want to share, the depth they want to dive to, and the duration they will spend scavenging for treasure. The deeper the player dives, the more treasure the player can scavenge, but the more perilous the expedition. As each player descends into the dark murky waters, they will have to watch out for nasty sharks, earthquakes and worst of all, the other Divers!&#10;&#10;D3 puts a new twist on push-your-luck games, because like a co-op game, your planning and actions determine each others' success, but unlike a co-op game, all players scheme to get more treasure than the rest. This coupled with the very interactive Event Cards will create an engaging playing atmosphere that will keep everyone on their toes. It has shown to be a good game for families, girlfriends and wives.&#10;&#10;As the dive unfolds and the oxygen drains away with every gasping breath, will you remain as just another Lara Croft wannabe, or will you return with rich sunken treasures and maybe even the fabled Lost Jewel of Zakarra? It is all in your hands, or fins.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Decisive Victory 1918 - Vol. I Soissons &#10;&#10;Game scale&#10;Unit size: Regiment/Division&#10;Game Turn: 6 Hour Day/ 12 Hour Night&#10;Map Scale: 1 Kilometer per hex&#10;&#10;Whatever you do, you lose a lot of men &ndash; General Mangin, commander French 10 Army.&#10;&#10;The Battle of Soissons, 18 July to 28 July, 1918, is little known today, particularly in the English-speaking world. It is significant for a number of reasons; it was the first time that the French army used a large-scale attack with tanks supported by a surprise (i.e. not pre-registered) artillery bombardment, similar to the British attack the previous year at Cambrai, and it was the first time that full-size US divisions went on the offensive incorporated in the French army. But most importantly, it was the opening of the Second Battle of the Marne. It  was not known at the time, although suspected by many, that this battle was the death-knell of the German army.&#10;&#10;French 10 Army, reinforced by US troops, had been assembled to strike the over-stretched German forces on one side of the Soissons &ndash; Ch&acirc;teau Thierry &ndash; Reims salient. The French had sixteen infantry divisions, including two US corps-sized divisions, as well as over three hundred tanks. The Germans facing them consisted of ten divisions, the quality of which varied widely although all had taken a battering during the Spring Offensive fighting. The German positions had been reached a few weeks previously during the final thrust of the offensives and therefore there had been no time to extensively fortify it; thus the battle was far more mobile than most of those previously on the Western Front. In addition, German artillery was sparse at the start of the battle because all of the heavy &amp; super-heavy artillery in the area had been sent north for the planned Hagen Offensive in Flanders, giving the French a roughly 2.5:1 advantage in artillery. Although the battle continued beyond when the game ends, it was largely over by the 23 July, progress after that day being very slow, which is why the simulation terminates on that day. The German defence at Soissons was skilfully executed, particularly as the attack had been a complete surprise.&#10;&#10;Decisive Victory 1918 is a series of three games that when combined will cover the entire Allied offensive in July of 1918 know as the Second Battle of the Marne.&#10;&#10;This simulation illustrates the main features of late WWI combat. If the campaigns of 1918 were a far cry from the static trench warfare which had characterized the previous years, defense still retained absolute tactical advantage over the offense. Even with the element of complete surprise and greater numbers of troops and equipment facing a tired enemy, the French army was unable to maintain the pace of the advance attained on the first two days. This was not through any lack of competent commanders: not only could the defender always bring in reinforcements in men and equipment faster than the attacker, but the attacker&rsquo;s speed, maneuverability, and ability to operate autonomously were still limited. It was very difficult, after the enemy's frontline was breached, to maintain any prolonged advance once the troops had progressed beyond friendly artillery cover and outpaced their logistical services. In addition, a few resolute defenders huddled around a handful of machine guns could inflict grievous casualties and delay vastly superior numbers. To adequately reflect these key aspects of late WWI warfare, the design incorporates elements and mechanisms that depart from the more standard hex &amp; counter systems.&#10;&#10;The game features mandatory attacks into multiple hexes, very rigid ZOC, and severe restrictions on disengagement and advance after combat. &ldquo;Threat zones&rdquo; extend beyond the standard 1-hex ZOCs and represent limited knowledge of the enemy&rsquo;s positions, thus preventing unrealistic infiltration through narrow gaps in the frontline.&#10;&#10;The Combat system is highly attritional, in terms of casualties and cohesion disruption. Reorganization is a slow process, conducted under the cover of the night. Attacking units rapidly deplete their offensive power. Defending units, on the other hand, are never completely eliminated, and retain (as &ldquo;remnants&rdquo;) indefinite residual defensive power. Defensive initiative superiority also translates into special &ldquo;fall back&rdquo; movement, which allows defenders to extricate themselves from dangerously outflanked positions and avoid encirclement.&#10;&#10;Moreover, the system emphasizes the need for proper coordination and preparation in order to launch a successful assault: Artillery support, effective command control, and a fundamental factor, most neglected in the vast majority of wargames, time, to draw battle plans, register artillery coordinates, conduct adequate reconnaissance and rest and resupply the troops. Accordingly, the system requires assaults to be prepared one turn in advance. Improvised, &ldquo;on the move&rdquo;, attacks are also possible, but are likely to be ineffectual unless facing negligible resistance.&#10;&#10;The Entente player will have to make the best out of his initial breakthrough, and be careful not to exhaust its offensive power too soon in order to retain some impetus for when German reinforcements move in to consolidate the frontline. Judicious use of his unwieldy and short-lived, but powerful armored assets is critical to the success of the offensive. The German player will have to conduct a methodical retreat, knowing when and where to give ground to preserve his forces and when and where to make a dogged stand.&#10;&#10;The game, playable in one sitting, has a low counter density and is highly suitable for solitaire play.&#10;&#10;Volume One: Soissons -  is a stand alone game that covers the French 10th army sector.&#10;&#10;Volume Two: Chateau Thierry-  is a stand alone game that covers the French 6th army sector.&#10;&#10;Volume Three: TBD - is an add-on game (with the previous two) that covers the Eastern half of the offensive.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "&quot;Shiloh is a tactical level simulation of the largest single battle in US military history up to that date.  Before the two-day battle was ended, elements of of three complete armies totalling 100,000 men had participated, as well as elements of the US Navy.  At the end of the second day, over 23,000 men were casualties.  The battle ws launched by the South, hoping that the newly-created Army of the Mississippi could decisively defeat the Union Army of the Tennessee before it could link up with the Army of the Ohio.  Tactically, the battle was a Marginal victory for Union forces, although its strategic implications wee much more far-reaching.  Had the South succeeded in its attpempt, the state of Tennessee would have been recaptured by the Confederacy, and Union offensive power broken in the Western Theatre for at least a year.  A Confederate thrust into the North would have been by no means improbable.  The Union victory at Shiloh, more than any other battle, sealed the Confederacy's fate in the West.&quot; (from the Shiloh rules folder.)&#10;&#10;Shiloh is one of four games included in the Blue &amp; Gray Quadrigame set.  The game includes a 17&quot; x 22&quot; three-color map, 100 counters and an Exclusive rules folder.  A Standard rules folder, containing rules common to all four games included in the Quadrigame, is also included.&#10;&#10;Scale is 400 meters/hex. 1-2 hours per Game Turn.  Game mechanics are a simple movement-combat system with rigid zones of control.  Sequential Player Turns, retreat and advance after combat are common to these games and surrounding to cut off retreat is a major strategy.&#10;&#10;A new concept, &quot;Attack Effectiveness&quot; is introduced in this set of games.  Essentially, attacking units that receive an &quot;Attacker Retreat&quot; result in combat are rendered &quot;ineffective&quot; (may not make further attacks, but still defend normally) for the rest of the day.  This restriction is removed once a Night turn occurs.  This makes &quot;what the heck&quot; type attacks very risky as one's army can be rendered quickly &quot;ineffective&quot; through a series of low-odd attacks.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Shiloh: Grant Surprised&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "For centuries, the citizens of the Cupcake Kingdom have lived peacefully in a delicious dessert utopia. They've done so side-by-side with fantastical fauna, creatures with a cavernous craving for the choicest of cupcakes. Using sweet treats with the perfect blend of sugar, spice, and everything nice for each species, monster trainers befriend and tame these wild beasts. Feed them too many cupcakes at once, though, and they won't get the sugar rush they crave...but a terrible tummyache instead!&#10;&#10;In Creatures and Cupcakes, monster trainers compete to tame two magical creatures to show off to the Cupcake King and Cupcake Queen. The trainer who does this first wins.&#10;&#10;In this press-your-luck game, players pull cupcakes out of a bag. Every cupcake you draw advances you a space on each creature's affection track. However, if you draw two of the same in a row, your turn ends immediately. Even going bust has its sweet rewards as that player will get either a special power card with a one-time effect or a medicine card to help keep that monster from overeating next time.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "In Jackal &amp; High, each player has three eight-sided dice, and with these he attempts to match the values of &quot;pack cards laid out in the middle of the table. Each round the players roll their dice and distribute them on the different cards. They can hold back dice for the next round, rolling them again then. The sum on a player's dice placed on a card must always be lower or the same as the card's value.&#10;&#10;After three rounds, all dice must be placed. Dice which cannot be placed go to &quot;Vulture Valley&quot;, where at the end of each round you can win an additional card &ndash; or lose one of the cards you already collected. The pack cards are then resolved as follows: Each pack card is given to the player whose dice match the card's value or who has the highest total on this card. If players are tied on a pack card, they compete in &quot;dice combat&quot; using only the dice on this card, with the highest total winning the card. Thus, dice combat might take place between one die and three dice, both matching the card's value.&#10;&#10;Special cards allow a player to collect more than one card at once, e.g., all cards which could not be won by matching dice in the previous round.&#10;&#10;Aside from a numerical value, each pack card shows a number of paws, and these are the real victory points. The player who holds the most paws at the end of the game is declared leader of the savanna.&#10;&#10;",

When pedestrians put coins into these machines, surprises await them as they open the packages.&#10;&#10;Strange Vending Machine is a fast-paced and light family game. Players choose which vending machines to buy food from in order to score points. If a player has no cash in hand, they can shake money out from a vending machine, so watch carefully and observe which vending machines have the most money! Strange Vending Machine comes with two rule sets: &quot;Muscle Man's Purchase Challenge&quot; and &quot;Ingredients and Recipes of the Mysterious Wizard&quot;. The two games have independent rule sets and cannot be combined in play.&#10;&#10;In &quot;Muscle Mans Purchase Challenge&quot;, each player has a vending machine full of food cards. During the player's turn, every one choose one of following actions to perform simultaneously: Buy a food card, stock a food card and take coins, take one coin from the supply. If the end condition is satisfied, the game ends. Score food cards in front of the players, and the total coins owned. The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;In &quot;Ingredients and Recipes of the Mysterious Wizard', there are six vending machines placing on the game box. During a player's turn, the active player either buys a food card from one of the vending machines, or takes all the coins from one of the machines. Each food card is contained of an ingredient and a recipe. The recipes provide victory points in the end of the game, as the required ingredients are satisfied. Once a player purchases their fifth food card, all other players take one more action, and a Final Coin Shake occurs. Score the recipe points at the bottom of the food cards. Each ingredient may be scored multiple times. Each fake coin is worth negative 1 point. The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Suddenly you see one, and put your plane into a dive from out of the sun...&#10;&#10;Eagles in the Sky is a 2-player card-based game on plane to plane warfare during the last year and a half of the First World War. Players each command a &quot;flight&quot; of 1 to 6 aircraft during any of several types of missions, including patrols, photo recon and even balloon busting.&#10;&#10;The game includes all of the major types of aircraft active on the Western Front in that period, including the Fokker triplane, Sopwith Camel, SPAD XIII and Fokker DVII.&#10;&#10;Eagles in the Sky may be played in one of two ways: individual engagements or campaigns, in which the players control &quot;squadrons&quot; and complete 5 days of missions, taking into account losses, pilot fatigue and the requirements of higher headquarters.&#10;&#10;Each engagement is 8 turns long, and each turn except for the first begins with a random event. These can add or subtract aircraft from the engagement, cause flak fire or other effects. The players then determine who has the initiative and draw a hand of cards based on the number of scouts (fighters) in their flight and the ratings of the flight leader. They then (beginning with the player with initiative) alternate playing cards to activate their aircraft. Activations can be Targeted against another plane or ground target or Untargeted (things like clearing gun jams). When targeting another aircraft the target can play a card in response. Depending on the planes' ratings and the cards played one aircraft may gain Position over another, which allows it to attack. Attacks are resolved by drawing a card and checking the combat portion of that card to see if the attack succeeds and how much damage it does.&#10;&#10;In a campaign each day begins with one player drawing cards to see which particular missions will occur that day. Players then resolve each mission in turn, starting by assigning aircraft and pilots to it. A given pilot can fly as many times per day as the player wishes, but each flight incurs fatigue, which will eventually exhaust that pilot.&#10;&#10;Missions are resolved as engagements (using the base rules) or encounters, where each side's aircraft meet a non-player opposing force. At the end of each day, players reduce fatigue of their pilots, repair damaged aircraft and attempt to get replacements for any planes or pilots that have been lost.&#10;&#10;The game plays quickly; a one on one dogfight can take as little as 15 minutes, and even a campaign can be completed in a long evening. Components include a play mat, 140 1&quot; square aircraft counters, 176 5/8&rdquo; square markers, 110 cards and numerous play aids and record sheets.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

In the kitchen, time doesn't stop. We're cranking out crabs at full speed! While you man the grill, your pal is already starting up the bike to deliver his first order on time. You can't afford to be the weak link in this chain!&#10;&#10;McJohny's is an action-packed party game for 3 to 6 players that takes about 20 minutes. The game is comprised of different mini-games. Each shift, one player is the manager and decides who has to do what. Together they try to satisfy some of the four customers that come to the restaurant. Employees are allowed to work only one minute because of very strong unions. Also due to the low budget, there aren't always wages for everyone, so not all of the staff wants to cooperate.&#10;&#10;In the end you count up your acquired little crabs &mdash; the only currency usable at McJohny's &mdash; and trade them in at the restaurant gift shop. Maybe you'll earn enough to go on holidays to Crab Island!&#10;&#10;",

The planet &ldquo;Etheria&rdquo;, the only place in the universe where you can find the &ldquo;Ether&rdquo;, the most powerful energy in its purest form. The &ldquo;Ethereals&rdquo;, the old inhabitants of this planet time ago disappeared.

The game is played with a standard 52-card deck (or with multiple standard decks shuffled together with large numbers of players).&#10;&#10;Each player takes an even share of the deck as their face-down pile. Players take turns laying a single card from the top of their pile. If a face card is played, the player after the player who laid the card has a number of chances to play another face card (J=1, Q=2, K=3, A=4). If they succeed play continues as usual; If they fail, the player who played the last face card claims the entire pile. If, at any time, certain &quot;sets&quot; appear in the pile (usually pairs and sandwiches, but not limited to triples, runs, etc) ANY player may SLAP the pile and claim all the cards.  Even a bystander may do this and jump into the game. The game ends when one player has all the cards.&#10;&#10;",

There are  also five matching sets of wooden disks, 10 of each color.&#10;&#10;The cards are dealt out equally to the players and they alternate playing one card face-up to the table. Unlike a trick-taking game, there is no need to follow suit; players may play any card they desire. If a player lays a card of the same color and a LOWER value as a previously laid card that round, the higher card is turned over and is out of play. When play returns to a player who still has his card face-up in front of him, he collects a number of chips from the stockpile which matches the number and color of the card he played. If his card is face-down, however, he does not collect any chips. In either case, he plays another card and the cycle continues until the players have played all of their cards.&#10;&#10;When collecting chips, if the stockpile of a certain color is depleted, the player then steals the required number and color of chips from the opponent who currently possesses the most chips of that color. Thus, each player's collection of chips is constantly in danger of being confiscated by their opponents.&#10;&#10;The basic rules call for a number of rounds equal to the number of players, with the player collecting the greatest cumulative total of chips over those rounds being the victor.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Koplopers en Dwarsliggers&#10;&#10;The game Koplopers en Dwarsliggers puts the players in charge of their own railway company. These companies may use all railway tracks in the Netherlands. Their only goal is to transport as many passengers as possible to their intended destinations. For these passengers the journey from Rotterdam to Amsterdam may well go via Eindhoven.&#10;&#10;Sometimes there is a sudden change of direction when the train has picked up more passengers, and a majority of those want to go to another part of the country. At other times trains may well skip stations when no passengers need to be there. And when a train does call at a station the passengers enter quickly hoping that they will arrive at their destination today. Is your train the one to be in? How many times they must change trains in order to arrive at their destination? Or will they not make it at all, because of those annoying obstructions?&#10;&#10;Introduction to the game&#10;In Koplopers en Dwarsliggers every player may construct up to three trains and each of those trains can transport up to 500 passengers. During the game you pick up passengers at stations and put their tokens at your train organizer card in the corresponding box. And then you try to transport your passengers to their destinations, after which you collect their tokens in your tray. Each turn you may spend five action points that you can use for constructing or scrapping trains, but you may also combine trains, split them up again, or reverse them. You can pick up passengers, transport them or have them change trains, and finally you can play obstruction cards or perform an emergency repair. The player who has brought the highest number of passengers to their destination wins the game.&#10;&#10;Some interesting facts&#10;&#10;        Koploper is a Dutch train type (see game box), but it also means &lsquo;front runner&rsquo;. The railway meaning of dwarsligger is sleeper, but it also is Dutch for an obstructive person;&#10;        The game board is based on the actual railway lay-out in the Netherlands;&#10;        The abbreviations used to denote stations are the official abbreviations used by the Dutch railway companies;&#10;        The designer of the game works for Nederlandse Spoorwegen, the main passenger railway company in the Netherlands.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Using a deck of cards they will be adding new troops to the frontline, man&oelig;uvre their forces and deploy powerful leaders. At the end of each turn battles will be resolved and victory points will be allocated. The first side to reach 7 points wins.&#10;&#10;",

You want to share the study of one celestial body with your colleague without monopolizing it, yet still gain more authority than them.&#10;&#10;In more detail, the game contains three suits of cards: Sun, Moon, and Earth, with ten copies of each. Each player gets a hand of fourteen cards and cannot rearrange them. The lead player plays 1-3 cards of a single suit, and when choosing something to play, you can't break up pairs or triplets in your hand. If you have three Earth cards in a row, you can play them only together as three Earths. The following player must play the same suit, if possible, but a different number of cards; if they can't do this, they can play 1-3 cards from either other suit.&#10;&#10;If both players play the same suit, the player who played more cards wins the trick, stacks the cards in their collection, then leads to the next trick. If players play different suits, then the player who has fewer cards of their played suit in their collection wins the trick. (In a tie, the following player wins.)&#10;&#10;When a player runs out of cards, the round ends. Each player tallies their score. If you have more cards in a suit than your opponent, you score points equal to the number of cards they have. Whoever has the highest score wins the round; the first player to win two rounds wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "The International Space Station (ISS) is a joint project in which sixteen countries are currently involved. The ISS is a symbol of what people can achieve by working together. Boundaries that seem so important on Earth take a back seat on the space station; what matters is a perfectly coordinated collaboration between the astronauts.&#10;&#10;Mission ISS begins in 1998 when the first module of the ISS was built. From your control center, you give instructions to the astronauts in space. At first only a few crew members are on the station, but over time you bring more astronauts to the station to add new modules, carry out various research assignments, or just drift in weightlessness. As on the real space station, the co-operation between the players and the co-ordination of the astronauts determine the success of the ISS mission. Only together will you be able to master the challenge of space.&#10;&#10;In more detail, the mechanism at the heart of the game requires deep co-operative play. To give instructions to astronauts, you combine two command cards: one of yours and one of your teammates. After you have performed the command effects, you place both cards on your own discard pile, which means that your turns always have an impact on the options of the other players. When you run out of cards, you take all cards from your discard pile to re-fill your display &mdash; but doing so brings the end of the game closer.&#10;&#10;Up to six astronauts can be on the ISS. Each astronaut stands on a base with adjustable values for three types of abilities: drift to move, carry out researches, and add new modules. Train the astronauts to improve their abilities so that they can manage all of the challenges on the ISS.&#10;&#10;",

The game centers on the interaction between pieces (four each) and tiles.   The board starts with neutral tiles in each position and as the game progresses you replace the tiles with your own color by moving across borders.    As you gain more tiles in a borderland, so your pieces there gain more power of movement.   Using a connection change you can sweep a piece across the board changing tiles to your color, or with two pieces you can pincer an opposition piece.   You win the game by placing your 42nd tile on the board, or by eliminating all your the opponent's pieces.  You will probably take 15 minutes from first acquaintance to grasping the rules.&#10;&#10;With 3 or 4 players you start with 3 pieces each.&#10;&#10;Separate entries exist for Pacru, Shacru &amp; Azacru as opinions vary widely on the 3 games.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "This is a game detailing the Persian Gulf War fought in the early 1990's. Many of the mechanics are similar to that of one of TSR's other wargames (Red Storm Rising) so players of that game can rather easily go to this game.&#10;&#10;Two versions of this game are played. With less than 5 players, the game is a &quot;Basic Game&quot; where military might is what wins the game. Players take sides, usually a combination of Middle Eastern nations plus the US. In the two player version, for instance, it is (quite predictably) the US &amp; Allies vs. Iraq; in the three-player game &quot;Holy War&quot;, it's Israel vs. Iraq (and Yemen and Jordan) vs. Saudi Arabia (and Syria, Libya, and Lebanon), and so on.&#10;&#10;Combat rules are rather straightforward, and wargamers will be familiar with many of the mechanics. Land (w/ infantry, Iraqi National Guard, and tanks), sea, and air units are all utilized. Most units can take a few hits before removed from the board.&#10;&#10;The *real* game, though, is the six-player diplomatic game. The players are now clearly defined: The US (NATO), Iran, Israel, Iraq/Yemen, Moderate Arabs (Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Kuwait, etc.), and Volatile Arabs (Jordan, Libya, etc.) This adds a crucial element of diplomacy and politics, and makes the game much more interesting than the normal wargaming stuff. A &quot;War Fever&quot; and &quot;Jihad&quot; marker change as nations do things--for instance, the first time a US unit is attacked outside of Turkey, War Fever &quot;tripwires&quot; to 10. If Israel attacks a neighbor, Jihad increases by 2. War Fever and Jihad permit certain things to happen--for instance, if War Fever gets too low, the US is restricted in whom they may attack. If Jihad hits either 1 or 10, revolutions may occur--which can switch entire nations to another player!&#10;&#10;Messages can be sent to other players via a diplomatic pouch--you cannot simply pull another player to the side and whisper in their ear. All messages, once read, go into a big pouch, and players can make diplomatic gestures to read some of the messages after they're read.&#10;&#10;Victory occurs, in any case, when you meet objectives, which can vary from player to player. &quot;War Aim&quot; chits are drawn before the game begins, and so players are not quite certain as to exactly what other players are going for. For Instance, Iraq may win if they capture and hold Kuwait for the last three turns; if Jihad has reached 10 at least once and 10 non-Muslim units have been destroyed (by anyone); or by controlling three more oil fields than they started with. It all depends on what they looked for.&#10;&#10;All in all, the Diplomatic game changes the basic game so much that political considerations are as important as military ones.&#10;&#10;A simplified version of the game with the same name appeared in the TSR comic Warhawks #3. Advanced scenarions for the game in the comic appeared in Warhawks #4.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "1914 is a traditional hex and counter wargame that attempts to simulate the opening phases of WW I on the Western Front.  This was James Dunnigan&rsquo;s second game for Avalon Hill. Like many wargames combat is resolved through the use of dice and a Combat results table (CRT).&#10;&#10;The players accumulate victory points by occupying 24 key areas at the game end as well as points for enemy units destroyed.  The Eastern Front with Russia is abstracted and the German player may receive victory points for deploying part of his initial forces there, and will lose points for invading Belgium, Luxembourg or Holland.  The player who most effectively wears down his opponent and holds geographical objectives will win the game.&#10;&#10;This game is particularly complex in comparison to other Avalon Hill games at the time.  Not only does it have a 34 page rulebook, use unit facing, supply line limitations, and a CRT,  there are also multiple options for fog of war (counters turned upside down or dummy counters), and step losses for units.   There is a short and long version of the game as well as cards for several variants.  Several options such as simultaneous movement and delayed commands require a third player as a referee.  The long version of the game may take multiple sittings to accomplish.&#10;&#10;While not an easy 'game' to play, 1914 is a rewarding simulation both innovative for its day and enjoyable to play. While this game is very different from other games from the period and has a couple of faintly tedious mechanics it is worth the effort and can be quite exciting to play. By today's standards we would like to see forced march and some command hurtles for the over extended Germans but one could say something similar about most old games.  This game does not allow players to ramp up a decided combat advantage from a god's eye point of view. No individual combat is decisive and one can only manage this not overcome it. The game needs to be played with all its bells and whistles (minus those requiring a referee) and when one bothers to do this they find an intriguing game of deception where planning pays off.&#10;&#10;For those who do not have the revision kit:&#10;&#10;Forced March:&#10;Each unit rolls on a D6 (as I recall this is limited to infantry and cavalry units)&#10;1,2 Cannot move at all.&#10;3-6 Gain 1 mp.&#10;&#10;The Plan 17 rule requires the French to make 6 attacks on turns 1-3.&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;1. 390 Die Cut Counters in two sheet (note: 37 of the 390 are blank counters.)&#10;2. Color mounted map - 27&quot; x 22&quot; sections.&#10;3. One Basic Game instruction manual (4 pages).&#10;4. One Battle Manual (36 pages).&#10;5.

In order to win, the player must reach the base TANGO 2 with at least two of their Leopard tanks, while trying to comply with the restrictive Rules of Engagement. Meanwhile, the opposition will use machine guns, rockets and tanks to stop the UN forces while its artillery tries to surrender TANGO 2. Any player casualty will be considered a failure of the mission.&#10;&#10;The game mechanism is based on a system of orders that all vehicles will follow until achieved or changed. All orders will issue from the commanding APC and they have to be relayed to each individual vehicle, which can be difficult once vehicles start to receive damage. The player will have to balance movement, defense and offense as the UN mandate has complex Rules of Engagement and the Danish government will not tolerate having casualties in a foreign war.&#10;&#10;The victory conditions are based on both completing the mission and the way the mission is completed, which depends on the player's choices, and is evaluated at four levels: operational (if the mission is completed), tactical (defeating the opposition forces), strategical (respecting the UN mandate) and political (respecting the player's government orders).&#10;&#10;The splendid art from artist Nils Johansson and SNAFU Design Team recreates the games rules as a magazine from the 1990's and gives the map and player aids the look and feel of the military computer interfaces present at that time.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

You must now make your way back to Earth in the midst of a large meteor storm but something seems to be messing with your sensors and not everything is as it seems. Did you build the ship incorrectly or has the computer somehow got on board and is now trying to thwart your escape? And can you collect a sample en-route to assist with the creation of the vaccine?&#10;&#10;Navigating through the ongoing meteor storm requires planning, strategic thinking and perhaps even a bit of risk taking, however not everything is as it seems. Working alone or with your fellow escapee, you must use your fuel wisely else you will become stranded in the Earth&rsquo;s upper atmosphere, or worst, blown up by a meteor impact.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
