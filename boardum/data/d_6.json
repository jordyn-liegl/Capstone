Also provided was a complete turn-by-turn sample game.&#10;&#10;The game is a hypothetical meeting of U.S. and Soviet forces in West Germany.  To win, the Soviet player must occupy two of the three town hexes in four turns, otherwise the U.S. player wins.&#10;&#10;The Second edition of this game, published in 2007 by Victory Point Games, is the first game in their BATTLESSON (TM) series.

After laying a second card in the round, a player has the option of securing a row at the end of each turn. To secure a row, the player must not have the lowest total in that color when compared to the other players; the player secures a row by turning the last card in that row 90&ordm;. A player can secure only one row each turn.&#10;&#10;If a player exceeds a total of 15 points in a row, that row is now blocked and worth 0 points; the player turns those cards face-down.&#10;&#10;If a player draws a colored card for a row either secured or blocked, she must discard the card. The next player in turn order has the option of taking this discarded card instead of drawing randomly from the deck.&#10;&#10;Once the fourth row of any player is secured or blocked, the round ends immediately. Whoever has the fewest points in a color (with blocked rows worth 0 points) scores nothing for this color; all other players score points equal to the numbers showing in this color in their row. Players then empty their rows and continue playing with the cards remaining in the deck. After five complete rounds, the player with the highest total score wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "In Vikings: Warriors of the North, players take the roles of Viking jarls, fighting for control over the North and the Konung Crown. The first one to pillage all of the villages and take the daughters of their thanes to his home port as warranty of recognition of jarls authority will be declared the winner. To do this, the jarls will have to brave the stormy northern seas, battling each other along the way, and watch out for the sea monster that lurks beneath the waves! The most cunning and vehement of them all &ndash; that is, the one who the Gods favor &ndash; will throw a great feast and become the Konung of the North.&#10;&#10;Vikings: Warriors of the North is a card-based game. Players draw cards from a common deck. Wind cards are used for moving a drakkar around the board that depicts the cold north sea. Players can move the drakkar to a village (to sack it), to an enemy drakkar (to attack it), or to their own ports, where they can throw a feast for the Gods.&#10;&#10;A player can also use cards to drastically change the gameplay: He can increase his chances in an attack, re-roll the dice, sail further with his drakkar, or steal cards from an enemy's hand. All of those cards represent story events that have tangible effects within the game. Some cards represent heroes who can become part of a drakkar's crew. As long as a hero stays on the ship, he grants his owner a permanent effect. Each drakkar has three open slots for heroes. Daughters of the thanes are also considered heroes, so they also occupy drakkar slots. With only three slots, players have to think hard about their crew composition.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player can play any number of cards from his hand and take one action: attack, sack a village, throw a feast, etc. Attacks are resolved by a roll of a six-sided (d6) die, although many cards influence the combat result, so each battle is exciting.&#10;&#10;When a player take three daughters of the thanes (each of a different, opposing player color) and brings them to his own port, the game is over and that player wins. The gameplay is fast, furious and fun, full of twists and comebacks; it really lets you feel like a Viking chieftain!&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Generally, the game of Nim is a two-player game of perfect information in which there are some number of rows or &quot;heaps&quot; of objects, and a legal move consists of removing any number of objects from a single heap. (For a non-trivial game, we should start with at least three heaps.) In &quot;standard play&quot;, the player who cannot make a move on his turn (because no objects remain) is the loser. A very general and far-reaching theory of such games is developed in Berlekamp, Conway, and Guy's Winning Ways for Your Mathematical Plays.&#10;&#10;In the commercial version pictured, the players take turns removing 1, 2, 3, or 4 pegs together in a row. It would appear from the picture that &quot;rows&quot; can run in any direction, which means that the &quot;heaps&quot; intersect. This is not what most people know as Nim. Also, according to the original description, in this version the loser is the player who has to remove the last peg. This is so-called &quot;misere play&quot;, rather than the standard winning condition. Many combinatorial games allow mis&egrave;re play as a variation.&#10;&#10;Nim is solved, which means that from any initial configuration, one can readily determine whether the next player or the previous player has a winning strategy, and identify a good next move in the former case. For Nim, this can be determined surprisingly readily no matter the size of the heaps, but you're not going to get the secret from me.&#10;&#10;As most who would be interested in Nim know the solution, there isn't much of a game here. But Nim plays a central role in the theory of combinatorial games, as any two-player finite impartial game is in some sense Nim in disguise: any position in such a game corresponds to a unique Nim-heap, and one can play the disguised game perfectly by making the moves that correspond to winning moves in Nim. Sprouts is one example. This however does not mean that Sprouts itself is solved, as the &quot;disguise&quot; is only partially revealed.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "In World War Z: The Game, a strategy game based on the movie and book of the same name, players work together to stop the spread of the zombie pandemic across the globe. Two to four players begin the game by choosing an ability-granting Role Card and starting in the United States. Players roll a die to initiate the zombie threat, represented by horde tokens of strengths 1 through 4 placed in zones around the board. Special &quot;grey zones&quot; represent lack of intel by featuring face-down tokens with zombie hordes of unknown strengths. Throughout the game, players travel to different zones and battle the zombie hordes in those locations by rolling dice and adding effects of Combat Cards.&#10;&#10;The game features a die-based combat system. Humans always roll a six-sided die, while the hordes are represented by either a six-, eight-, ten-, or twelve-sided die depending on their strength. Humans may modify their role or add additional effects by playing Combat Cards, which consist of reusable Weapons (including Lobos, slang for &quot;Lobotomizers&quot;) and one-shot Tactics (like Booby Traps or Redeployment). Every time a human wins a battle, the zombie horde strength decreases by one level, while victories for zombies cause players to discard Combat Cards. At the end of each turn, humans draw a Threat Escalation card to reveal how the zombie threat has grown.&#10;&#10;Though players start the game working together against the zombies, when a player loses all his Combat cards, he becomes one of the undead. Player-zombies can manipulate the hordes on the board to attack other humans and to escalate the zombie threat.&#10;&#10;The game ends after a predetermined number of rounds based on the number of players (six rounds for four players, seven for three, and eight for two). At the end of the game, if more than ten total zombie hordes of strength 3 or 4 still remain on the map, the humans lose (and any zombie players win). If ten or fewer such hordes remain, the humans collectively win.&#10;&#10;",

Peasants from nearby villages collect amber, which is bought by merchants from distant lands. The barons know that the one who profits the most from the amber trade will become the most powerful ruler of the new lands.&#10;&#10;In Amber, players take the role of the barons, and their goal is to build trade routes that connect their castles to the villages where the amber is collected, and to the other barons' castles where it is traded. To this end, players build roads through the wilderness &ndash; placing one tile each turn in the shared playing area &ndash; which will allow their buyers to reach the sources of the amber. Since all buyers can use the roads, however, it's important to have suitable connections with the road networks built by others. The baron whose castle is connected with the greatest number of villages and castles will become the richest and most respected Lord of the new land.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Welcome to world of Storm the Castle!, a 1-4 player semi-cooperative game in which you take the exciting role of one of the four marauding Dark Forces armies in a race to breach Castle StormHaven's walls, overrun the defenders, and claim victory by reaching the castle's keep first.&#10;&#10;Breaching Castle StormHaven's thick walls is no easy feat. It takes a desire for loot, hordes of your minions willing to be led to certain death (err, victory), cunning strategy, and a touch of treachery. The first player whose Dark Force unit enters the keep, by the end of turn eight, is truly the mightiest champion and claims total victory for his army.&#10;&#10;The Story So Far - The Invasion Begins!&#10;&#10;Castle StormHaven is guarded vigilantly by brave defenders comprised of an alliance between Men, Elves, Halflings, and Dwarves. For over 300 years, these defenders have repelled numerous invasions from the Badlands, home to the subterranean Dark Elf marauders and the mysterious sect of arcane bending wizards, the Arcanists. StormHaven is the first and last line of defense from keeping the fertile farmlands and gold mines of Western Holmenstein from being overrun.&#10;&#10;Years ago, a mysterious masked and exceptionally short villain appeared with the goal of uniting the Badlands and ruling over Holmenstein. Dubbed &quot;the Boss&quot; by his cohorts, he promised gold and power to those who would follow him. First the Dark Elves, then the Arcanists joined his Dark Forces. Soon after, the Orc pirate raiders joined the growing army and brought with them their crazed goblin allies and monstrous cousins, the giants. Knowing The Boss' army needed further strength to overwhelm Castle StormHaven's defenses, he revealed the last piece of strategy for domination, the Undead Horde of the BlackSoot Swamps.&#10;&#10;Now the four dark force armies &ndash; Dark Elves, Arcanists, Orc and Goblins of the Green Tide, and the innumerable Undead host &ndash; begin their long march east.&#10;&#10;Dark Force Army Overview&#10;&#10;Choosing your army is part of the fun of Storm the Castle! Each Dark Force army has unique units, power cards, combos and strategies. Is one better than the other - no! It&rsquo;s how you use your strengths while minimizing your weakness. Each army has a fair opportunity to win.&#10;&#10;The Green Tide: Orcs, goblins, giants, and other humanoids make up this loose tribal alliance. Specializing in brute force and strange Eastern technology, players who enjoy large explosions, brute strength, and dangerous yet untested weapons will enjoy smashing their way to victory with this army.&#10;&#10;Pros: Hard hitting units with lots of equipment upgrades. Power cards primarily focused on attacking and smashing. The rock lobber is one of the most effective siege weapons in the game. Goblin sappas provide for cheap, hard hitting units.&#10;Cons: Moderately expensive units. Lack of diversity in their power cards utility. Equipment can be deadly for both you and foe!&#10;&#10;The Arcanists: Mixing metal with magic produces stunning results. These masters of the forbidden arcane arts use their talents to manipulate the minds and outcomes of events of their allies and enemies. Players who enjoy using tactics that harness deadly magics and powers to manipulate events will surely enjoy the awesome power of the Arcanists.&#10;&#10;Pros: Incredible power cards that can shift game elements to your favor. Several long range spells and abilities to generate quick magic. &#10;Cons: Many of your units have low health and are easily destroyed.&#10;&#10;The Undead Horde: The walking dead from the Blacksoot Swamps know of one thing - how to feed! Their power derives from their ever increasing numbers and ability to sustain damage while pressing forward. Players looking to overwhelm the Fantasy Defenders with hordes of undead while using dark magic will find great pleasure in fielding this army.&#10;&#10;Pros: Your units cause fear and can take quite a bit of damage.  Inexpensive units allow you to swarm and overrun the Fantasy Defender&rsquo;s defenses. &#10;Cons: Though your units are many, they don&rsquo;t hit hard. Magic can be hard to build up as its dependent upon how many undead units you have in play.&#10;&#10;The Dark Elves: From the deep recesses of forgotten lands nestled deep within the earth come the masters of marauding, the Dark Elves. Known for their exceptional arts in battlefield tactics and archery, no foe is safe from the tips of their arrows to the teeth of their treachery. Players who revel in treachery, backstabbing and shooting should choose the Dark Elves.&#10;&#10;Pros:  Awesome ranged attacks and power cards to support them. Treacherous power cards give you a unique competitive edge against other players.&#10;Cons: Squishy units means you&rsquo;ve got to know when to fight and when to move in. Players may give you strange &ldquo;can I trust you&rdquo; looks. Lack of strong melee units.&#10;&#10;",

Each player sits on one side of the board. The red, green, yellow or blue strip at the board&rsquo;s edge determines the color each player uses.&#10;&#10;A player is chosen to be banker. He distributes to each player 1 million dollars (5 x $10,000; 3 x $50,000; 3 x $100,000; 2 x $250,000). He puts the remaining money beside the board and administers it separately from his own money.&#10;&#10;The 25 movie cards are mixed thoroughly and a card is put face down on each board space.&#10;&#10;The 25 miniature screens and the 6 Golden Suns are put beside the board.&#10;&#10;Everyone throws the numbered die once. The player with the highest result (the star equals 6) begins. The game proceeds after him clockwise.&#10;&#10;Play, phase 1 &#10;On his turn, a player throws both dice. The intersection of the column (number-die) and row (letter-die) determines a board space. If the movie card on this space is face down, the player can and should buy this space with this card. He pays $10,000 to the bank and turns the card face up. Now, a miniature screen is put on this space. The player takes a screen from the reserve and puts it on the space so that his color appears through the two gaps in the framework of the screen.&#10;&#10;Finally, the acquired movie card is put into the screen, face up.&#10;&#10;Play, phase 2&#10;As soon as all 25 movie cards are owned and face up in miniature screens on the board, the second game phase begins. Now movie cards can change hands.&#10;&#10;Debts and bankruptcy&#10;If a player must pay a sum and no longer has sufficient cash, he must sell his movie cards and/or Golden Suns. The player chooses what he would like to sell. The bank pays the sums printed on the cards, and Golden Suns fetch the same amount. Sold movie cards are turned face down again, and the screens and Golden Suns go back to the reserve. How-ever, the bank only takes back cards and Golden Suns if a player is insolvent.&#10;&#10;A player who cannot settle his debts must declare bankruptcy. He gives all his remaining cash, miniature screens and Golden Suns back to the bank. The movie cards are turned face down again. The player retires from the game. If movie cards are turned face down in the second game phase, the game returns to the first game phase. Therefore, takeovers of movie cards that belong to other players cannot take place.&#10;&#10;Negotiations &#10;All players are allowed to negotiate with other players anytime, even if it is not their turn. Movie cards may be bought, sold or traded. Players can also negotiate in order to pay debts. They need not necessarily sell to the bank if they receive better purchase offers from players.  Players can also negotiate whether owed sums on opponents&rsquo; movie cards can be reduced or even free of charge.&#10;&#10;Ending the game&#10;The game is over when only one player remains. He is king of Hollywood!&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Time heals all wounds, they say, but the sudden death of a loved one sometimes shakes those who are left behind so much that their faith wavers. To prevent this, the gods send fate weavers to change the past and prevent death. In the game series UNDO, players slip into the role of these destiny weavers and do everything in their power to undo sudden deaths &mdash; whether murder or suicide. Not only do they travel minutes or hours back in time, but sometimes thousands of years to change events that have laid the foundation for the later stroke of fate. Sometimes a leap into the future can also provide important information.&#10;&#10;UNDO: Drowned Hopes is a beginners case for the UNDO Series and gets distributed for free through Pegasus Spiele on various events.

Each part has a number from 1-6 and the roll of a die decides which kind of body part you can take from the pool. The goal is then to complete as many clowns as possible.&#10;&#10;Jumbolino is representative of a whole class of children's games where players roll a die and add a puzzle piece to their board for the number on the die roll. Similar to Cootie, except that Cootie requires you to get multiples of some numbers (6 ea. of 6 for the legs, and 2 ea. of 4 and 3 for eyes and antennae).&#10;&#10;It's also similar to The Merry Game of Floundering, with some differences. In The Merry Game of Floundering:&#10;1. The Flounders have to be assembled in order. Body part 1 first, two next and so on.&#10;2. All the Flounders are put in the middle at the start.&#10;3. Flounders are not owned by players, they remain in the center even if fully assembled.&#10;4. Two dice are thrown for assembly. A player may use either number rolled to add a Flounder part. If both numbers relate to started Flounders, then both numbers can be used.&#10;5. A double thrown grants an extra turn.&#10;6. When a 6 and a 1 are thrown, the player may take a complete Flounder from the center and if there are none in the center that player may take a complete Flounder from another player.&#10;7. When all the Flounders are complete and owned, the player with the most wins. If they are tied, they throw the dice to decide the winner.&#10;&#10;Similar to Safari Builders, but Safari Builders is listed as 1-4 players.&#10;&#10;",

Welcome to New Earth...'&#10;&#10;Just one continent remains home to civilisation after a cataclysmic event. Much of the human race has perished &ndash; from billions to a few million. The world as we knew it has gone. Those that survived are split into various &lsquo;factions&rsquo; (or proto-nations). Each player assumes the role of a &lsquo;government&rsquo; leader charged with building his/her &lsquo;country&rsquo; by developing existing resources and assets; whilst expending production in the form of consumption and government cash on infrastructure.&#10;&#10;As much as each nation will want to trade with each other, there remains the probability that political and economical control of land and resources (zones) become ever more critical. Progress is measured in terms of social development levels and the emergence of new cities. The higher the Development Level the higher the value of each zone and thus victory points, but watch out for the 'catastrophes'.&#10;&#10;New Earth is a strategy game for 2-4 players with elegant game mechanics combining worker placement with innovative hand management and modular tile design that provides endless game scenarios. Game length is 12 turns and lasts around 60-90 minutes, though players can agree on an extended time-frame. For ages 12 &amp; up.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Mr. Game! is a family-friendly party board game where one player has the power to create permanent rules during the game.&#10;&#10;MECHANICS: Players use a simple roll-and-move system to navigate the board - roll two four-sided dice, choose one of the options, and move. If you land on a space with an ! on it, you draw a card from the game's singular tall stack of chaotic cards. The ultimate goal of the game is to land on the goal, but the goal can change places during the middle of the game if a special GOAL SWITCH Action card is drawn.&#10;&#10;CARDS: There are three kinds of cards in Mr. Game! - Actions, Powerups, and Badges. If you draw an Action, you must play it immediately and discard it. If you draw a Powerup, you must play it immediately, but it stays in play and affects your character's natural abilities (sometimes positively, sometimes negatively). If you draw a Badge, you may play it whenever you want, and you are allowed to keep it concealed.&#10;&#10;TILES: Many cards will bring Tiles into play. These small chipboard squares are essentially movable spaces that can be placed anywhere on the board. They change the layout of the board as soon as the enter play, adding spaces, removing spaces, or transfiguring spaces to have ridiculous, game-altering effects! They can be as simple as another ! space, or they can be as crazy as a Portal that transports you across the board!&#10;&#10;MR. GAME: Before the game begins, someone must volunteer to be Mr. Game. (They can change their title, but the default is Mr. Game) Players must direct all questions to Mr. Game. This character is in charge of adding permanent rules to the game if the need arises. The game is purposely designed so that the core rules allow you to play but leave out specific details. Mr. Game's job is to fill in these details as the game goes on. The more creative Mr. Game is, the more fun everyone has! Other players at the table are encouraged to suggest ideas, but Mr. Game has the final say. If you don't like how they are &quot;Mr. Game-ing&quot;, or they break one of the core tenets of being Mr. Game, just impeach them!&#10;&#10;Mr. Game! is designed to be simple to learn. If you just read this entire description, you already know how to play! Oh, and if you have a question... well, ask Mr. Game!&#10;&#10;",

Each card has an Egocentrism value and higher-valued cards also have special abilities.&#10;&#10;The goal of each player is to finish the game with the lowest Egocentrism score. One game can be composed of one or several rounds. Rounds play quickly.&#10;&#10;Shuffle the 60 cards, form a deck, and initiate a discard pile. Distribute 5 cards to each player to compose her hand.&#10;&#10;A card put into the discard pile is simply discarded when it came straight from the deck, but is played when it came from the hand of a player. A played card can trigger its special ability while a discarded card cannot.&#10;&#10;During your turn, you must complete one of the following&#10;actions:&#10;&#10;- Draw and either discard OR keep the card so it replaces one from your hand. The replaced card would then be played.&#10;- Take the first card from the discard pile so it replaces one card from your hand. The replaced card is then played.&#10;- Reveal a pair of equal-valued cards and play one.&#10;- Say &ldquo;STOP&rdquo; so the round will end just before your next turn&#10;starts.&#10;&#10;The round also ends immediately if a player has no more cards in hand.&#10;&#10;The game is therefore a race for the lowest score. The tricky part is that each player has the power to abruptly trigger the end of the round as a regular action on her turn. She must however be careful because other players might have lower scores than hers.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "A board game with a nicely realized island group, which offers protection for either four nations or four pirate bands (depending on the edition) and indigenous people. Components: 300 plastic markers, 150 tokens, 8 ships made of metal with 2 masts, 55 cards (3rd edition only), 3 six-sided special dice, 1 rules booklet.&#10;&#10;Between the second and third edition, the theme of the game changed. The first and second have a theme of four nations exploring and colonizing new land, while the third edition has a pirate theme. The third edition also adds 55 action cards, resulting in more chaos and - possibly - less strategy (at least that's what is suggested in the rules).&#10;&#10;The board shows an island group composed of five smaller island groups separated by ocean. There is a large island group in the middle and four smaller ones in the corners. The four smaller island groups are the homelands of the four nations in editions 1 and 2 and the pirate bases in edition 3. Nations / pirates set out to explore and conquer the big island group in the middle (or each others' homelands).&#10;&#10;Every round, each nation / pirate group has 10 action points. With these you can accomplish various actions: move, load ships, explore unknown areas, attack your opponents, etc. Most important action is probably exploration, in which you roll two special dice which determine how many natives and how much gold there is in a neighboring, unexplored land. You'll have to fight the natives to conquer that land and get the gold. The gold itself you use to muster new armies / pirates. Conquest ultimately decides the winner.&#10;&#10;In the 3rd edition, you can use special cards to optimize your course or counter the actions of opponents. Thus you have a large freedom of movement, unfortunately your opponents do also.&#10;&#10;A winner of the 1986 Concours International de Cr&#195;&#169;ateurs de Jeux de Soci&#195;&#169;t&#195;&#169;.&#10;&#10;",

Unclaimed tiles are placed back into the Zingo tile holder. If two players call the same tile, it goes to whoever called it first. The first player to cover all 9 spaces on their card shouts ZINGO and wins the game.&#10;&#10;The game also comes with two variants: Mini-Zingo where the first player to match three images in a row up or down is the winner, and Zany Zingo where you select a pattern to match on your card.

    "description": "There are three accepted variants of Baccarat: Baccarat Chemin de Fer, Baccarat Banque and Punto Banco. Typically played in Casinos, several standard decks of 52 cards are shuffled together and dealt from a communal card shoe.&#10;&#10;All three variants operate on the same principle; 2 cards are dealt in alternating order to a hand designated as the Player, and a hand designated as the Banker. Typically the Player hand is played by the person who bet the most on the Player's hand to win. Depending on the variant being played, certain circumstances allow either participant to draw an extra card then the cards are totaled (2s through 9s are worth their face value while 10s and face cards are worth ten points and aces are worth one point). If the total of a hand's cards exceed 10 points, the tens digit is dropped. The hand with a total closest to 9 wins and neither hand wins in the event of a tie.&#10;&#10;Punto Banco is the most common variant in North America, but requires no skill and operates solely on chance. Typically played in Casinos, the house always plays the Banker hand (although players may still bet on that hand to win). It is usually played with eight (8) decks of cards shuffled together.&#10;&#10;Conversely, Baccarat Banque and Baccarat Chemin de Fer (more common in Europe) allow the players to make choices during the game so a player's skill can affect the outcome. In either of these variants a player may choose to play the Banker himself and the other players play against his 'Bank' (supply of money). In Baccarat Chemin de Fer, the Bank passes when the Banker loses a hand. In Baccarat Banque, a player may remain the Banker so long as he still has funds or until all cards in the shoe have been dealt. Baccarat Banque is typically played with 3 decks of cards while Baccarat Chemin de Fer is typically played with 6. In most cases these variants are played completely in French even in English-speaking areas.&#10;&#10;Since the Banker has a slight edge over the Player in his chances of winning a hand, the house taxes all winning Banker bets when played in a casino (typically 5%).&#10;&#10;",

Two of the new cubes are marked with stars on all six sides, making them wild.  From the 1983 rules: &quot;When playing a wild cube, a player must state what word it represents, after which it cannot be changed during that turn.&quot;&#10;&#10;The 1988 version has 24 cubes - two of which are the starred wild dice.

The goal is to be the first team to reach the finish space on the board. The board shows a track consisting of green, yellow and blue spaces. The active team rolls a colour die and moves their pawn to the next space of the corresponding colours. A member of that team inserts the glasses of the same colour (different amounts of distortion) and rolls the die again to select which of the three words from the card he/she has to draw. He/she then tries to draw, wearing the glasses, so that his/her teammates manage to guess the word within the amount of time specified by the timer. If the team is successful, they roll the die again and move their pawn to the next space of that colour. If the time runs out before they have guessed correctly, the team's pawn stays where it is.&#10;&#10;The team who reaches the finish space first wins the game&#10;&#10;GOOGLY EYES is the hilarious family game that challenges your vision and leaves you googling for more! Put on the zany, vision-altering google eye glasses and start to draw while your team tries to guess what you're drawing. Is that an igloo or a turtle? A birthday cake or a fortress? Players take turns drawing and guessing, so everyone gets a chance to wear the glasses. The glasses come with three sets of lenses that range from mild changes to mind-blowing fun, so no one can see (or draw) straight--your vision will bounce off of the lenses. Googly Eyes is a fun twist on classic drawing games that lets players of different ages and skill levels compete on equal terms, since the goggles make it fun and challenging for everyone. Unlike any other drawing game you don't need to be an artist, and the rules are simple. Just roll the die and move--the space you land on tells you which color lenses to use (easy, medium, or hard). Then pick a card, set the timer, and start drawing. If your team guesses correctly you get to roll and move again; if not, then you stay where you are on the board. The first team to reach Finish wins.&#10;&#10;",

Each game of Wyvern is a struggle for domination of the tabletop Battlefield; your objective is to completely clear your opponent's Battlefield of Dragon and Terrain cards. To accomplish this, you will use your Dragons to attack cards in the enemy's Battlefield. However, your Dragons will not fight for you free of charge. Dragons love gold, so in Wyvern you must pay your Dragons to fight. You start with a bankroll of 25 gold pieces, and you are trying to clear your opponent's Battlefield while spending as little of your gold as possible.&#10;&#10;Wyvern, one of the first CCG's after Magic, is played with two decks.  One deck holds your dragons and terrain cards.  The other deck has your treasure cards and action cards.&#10;&#10;To set up the game you take the top six cards from your dragon deck and lay them face down in two rows of three cards.  Your front three dragons can fight the opponents front three dragons so you do have to be careful how you place.  Flying dragons can fight over one row.  Each player gets 25 gold (any markers you supply) and draws seven cards from their action deck.  On your turn...&#10;&#10;&#10;     You draw a card from your action deck.&#10;     Place a treasure or replace a treasure.  You may have up to two treasures per row.&#10;     You may change the position of one or two cards in your grid.&#10;     All players may play action cards one at a time around the table until everyone has played as many as they want.&#10;     You must choose one dragon to attack or replace a dragon or terrain card in your grid with the top card from your dragon deck face down.  A dragon can attack a face up card or a face down card hoping he can beat it.  Dragon numbers are compared and the strongest wins.  A losing dragon or terrain is not replaced and you lose by losing all six positions.&#10;     A second action phase now ensues.&#10;     You must discard down to seven cards.&#10;&#10;&#10;See also Dragon Hunt&#10;&#10;",

A pile is building up on the empty section but there are troublemakers lurking, causing rather unneighborly collapses. And why does little Susie have a blowtorch? Geez, you just want to get rid of your junk!&#10;&#10;In Flaming Pyramids, players are building one pyramid together using square tiles, but each player is trying to be the first to get rid of their own tiles.&#10;&#10;There are 40 regular tiles with a unique combination of color, number, and material. Except toward the end of the game, players have a hand of five tiles from which to choose, but they are constrained by the building regulations and the luck of the draw. There are also four tiles that can cause fires and one extra-heavy &quot;wild&quot; tile: these can be harder to place without causing extensive damage the later they emerge. If your placed tile causes mayhem (a collapse, fire, or explosion), the damaged tiles go back in your supply.&#10;&#10;Flaming Pyramids can be played as a friendly, casual game, an easy starter or filler, or as no-holds-barred multi-round competition.&#10;&#10;The first edition (with straw, wood and rocks instead of household items) is available to play for free on the Board Game Arena platform: https://boardgamearena.com/gamepanel?game=flamingpyramids&#10;&#10;",

You will win the game if you are able to destroy the three villainous Oni. However, if you fail to do so within the predetermined number of days (rounds), the Gate will remain open forever, and all of Japan will succumb to the shadow!&#10;&#10;Each round begins with a preparation phase, where new enemies will appear from the Gate, and the Heroes may develop their skills.  After that, each player will roll a set of dice and work together as a team to decide how to allocate, reroll, and sequence those dice. These dice can be used to attack your enemies directly, or combined in specific sets to execute powerful techniques. Finally, the Oni will roll its own dice to damage the Heroes, summon forth new Hordelings, and command those Hordelings in play to attack their targets.&#10;&#10;Out of the box, you can choose to play the Heroes as recommended...or, through use of GameTrayz technology, you can customize and store your own unique Heroes!

In each game, you will choose one of the three Oni to face of each Circle (difficulty tier). Each Oni is not only its own board, but also adds its own unique Attack cards and Hordeling cards to their respective deck. When an Oni is defeated, those Attack and Hordeling cards remain in those decks, as it passes its abilities and dark allies along to empower the next Oni!&#10;&#10;",

If he loses the challenge, it goes to the next player on the staircase and so-on until someone wins or everyone loses.  The key mechanic is deciding how to &quot;spend&quot; your dice rolls on which men in which part of the mansion.&#10;&#10;The designers note that the game is inspired by Can't Stop, and is therefore dedicated to Sid Sackson (who died during the production of the title).&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "From the makers of Quelf comes another party game designed to make you do more wacky things in sixty minutes than you'd normally do in day &ndash; heck, maybe an entire week. In FURT, you race against other players to try to be the first one to jump into a volcano. Why? Glory, fame, hot feet &ndash; whatever the reason, you're doing it.&#10;&#10;You move ahead in the game by completing actions in six categories, possibly making up outrageous lies about yourself, freshening up with a quick shower in your host's bathroom, or acting out the words &quot;butter patty&quot;. The categories are:&#10;&#10;&bull; The Volcano Has Spoken &ndash; Roll a black and you'll be subject to the whims of the volatile FURT volcano, which is sometimes angry, sort of bossy and always a bit weird.&#10;&#10;&bull; Straight-Faced &ndash; Can you keep a straight face while your friends and family members assault you with funny words? You're about to find out (psst: fluffer nougat, pussy willow, burp nut) whenever you roll a red.&#10;&#10;&bull; Guess What? &ndash; The volcano is chock full of funny words and you may find yourself acting out the phrase &quot;butter patty&quot; or drawing an invisible jet to get your friends to guess your word when you roll a green.&#10;&#10;&bull; Truth or Fiction? &ndash; Roll a purple and you reveal something about yourself. Is it truth or fiction? Only you know. The more people you fool, the more you move ahead!&#10;&#10;&bull; You Are... &ndash; Not yourself when you roll a yellow. Maybe you are having an identity crisis, who knows? Just be who the card says for thirty seconds and you can move ahead.&#10;&#10;&bull; What The?! &ndash; When you roll a blue, you'll get a TOP SECRET card that you must perform before your next turn. It could be annoying, outlandish, confusing, obnoxious or just plain freakish. You have been warned.&#10;&#10;",

Work together to move all of the dinosaurs through the valley and onto the island.&#10;&#10;In this cooperative game, kids ages 4+ will work together to move all the dinosaurs across the board and onto the islands. Players use one of their cards to move a dinosaur onto a matching space on the board. The dinosaurs don&rsquo;t share spaces, so players can get the dinosaurs really moving by playing the same item card twice and jumping over other dinosaurs! Mixed into the item cards are lava cards and when a player draws a lava card the lava moves one space closer to the valley. Players must get all the dinosaurs onto the island before the lava token reaches the bottom of the volcano.&#10;&#10;The bright and colorful image-based gameplay makes Baby Dinosaur Rescue easy to learn and fun to play! Once players know the rules there is no reading required which makes this a fun way for kids to use basic strategy skills and reduces competition by having the players work together to beat the game.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

Cards may be played from a number of sources: a player's hand (five cards to start), a player's &quot;game pile&quot; (a stack of 10 cards of which only the top card is face up and playable), or a player's &quot;reserve piles&quot; (whenever a player passes or completes a turn, they must add a card from their hand to their reserve piles - up to five reserve piles may be formed). Hands are continually replenished with new sets of five cards during the game. The object is to play all 10 cards from game pile to the center of the table.&#10;&#10;Similar to:&#10;&#10;     Pass P&#195;&#165;&#10;&#10;&#10;",
