Remnants of the civilizations devastated by the Virunian Tri-Ships, banded together in a determined coalition, awaited the moment to launch their counter-stroke.  In 2519 AD, the moment had arrived: the Virunians encounter their nemesis and, retreating headlong to the source of their power, find themselves dispersed and without their potent unified command.  Coalition telepaths, sensing the Virunian confusion, direct their forces to the Nullgate, arriving just as the first helpless Virunian vessels tumble forth from the stargates.  The battle to ensue will decide the Virunian fate in the galaxy.  StarGate re-creates this climatic battle using a stylized, semi-abstract system of movement that allows combatants to conceal themselves from one another in the various planes and dimensions created by the Nullgate.  Players use cardboard playing pieces, representing units of the Virunian and Coalition forces, to maneuver and engage in combat.

The player must draw a challenge card from the pile and place it face up in the middle of the table. The player who draws the card decides which person or object will be the subject of the challenge. The player can&rsquo;t decide to measure themselves. The player announces if this round is played in centimeters or millimeters. If the drawn challenge card cannot be played (for example, none of the players has a tattoo), treat this card as a freestyle card.&#10;&#10;Next all players &mdash; including the one who drew the card or chose the part to measure &mdash; secretly estimate the measurement. The players choose one of their number cards and play it face down on the table. The players can also answer by playing 2 number cards and their values are added together.&#10;Example: 17 + 30 = 47&#10;&#10;Once all players have played a number card face down, the cards can be revealed.&#10;The initial player measures the body part or object. The player who guessed the number closest to the real size or length wins the challenge card.&#10;&#10;Example: the correct answer is 35. If one player answered 38 and one player answered 30, the player with the 38 wins this turn.&#10;&#10;ENDING TURNS:&#10;The used number cards are discarded in a pile and all players refill their hands so they have 10 cards. The players draw 1 number card if they played 1 number card, or they draw 2 number cards if they played 2 number cards. If the draw pile is empty, shuffle the discard pile and create a new draw pile.&#10;&#10;The game continues clockwise (the player to the left of the first player draws the next challenge card, and so on).&#10;&#10;VICTORY:&#10;The first player to collect 5 challenge cards wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;The concept of Size Up is simple: Estimate the length of your grandmother's little finger, the width of your train ticket, or the circumference of a carrot. The tape measure is used to check the estimates afterwards. Whoever has the best sense of proportion wins!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The second edition of the MasterSweets comes with 8 different game modes:&#10;&#10;&rdquo;MasterSweets&rdquo; - competitive &#10; &rdquo;Clash of Sweets&rdquo; - player elimination &#10; &rdquo;Sweets Workshop&rdquo; - cooperative &#10; &rdquo;Lonely in The Kitchen&rdquo; &ndash; solo &#10; &rdquo;Endless Cookbook&rdquo; &ndash; competitive &#10; &rdquo;Team Sweets&rdquo; &ndash; team competitive (2 vs 2) &#10; &rdquo;The Best Clue&rdquo; &ndash; clue competitive &#10; &rdquo;Sweets Puzzle&rdquo; - competitive&#10;&#10;MasterSweets - core competitive game &#10;In &quot;MasterSweets&quot; you will take up the role of one of the 16 fancier confectioners, competing to present the best confectionery delights. MasterSweets uses unique game mechanic based on the set collection mechanic. In the game, a set of ingredient cards are ordered on the table- they form the cookbook. Each row or column of the cookbook represents one recipe. The players will try to collect the full set of ingredient cards that a recipe contains in order to complete it. But each player may also exchange a card from his hand with a card from the cookbook. This way the player changes the set of cards in the collections that all players are trying to collect.&#10;&#10;Clash of Sweets - player elimination game&#10;In &ldquo;Clash of Sweets&rdquo; each player will create his own unique cookbook and will try to steal his opponents&lsquo; recipes. This way, he reveals other players&lsquo; culinary secrets and their unique cookbooks decrease. After the last recipe from a player&rsquo;s cookbook is stolen, the player must leave the game. The last surviving player with recipes that have not been revealed is the winner.&#10;&#10;Sweets Workshop - cooperative game &#10;In &quot;Sweets Workshop&quot; a royalty has noticed our masters of the sweets. She wants them to make incredible sweets for her birthday. Now the players must combine their efforts and team up in order to precisely fulfil all the royalty&rsquo;s requirements. But they have not worked together before and the players have communication problems. In &ldquo;Sweets workshop&rdquo; each player holds the cards in his hand facing the rest of the players. The other players should give him clues about his cards.&#10;&#10;Lonely in The Kitchen - solo game &#10;To be a true master of the sweets, you need a lot of workouts. The best workout is when you are confronted with your own best achievements. The solo game mode &quot;Lonely in The Kitchen&quot; has the same gameplay as the core game &ldquo;MasterSweets&rdquo; for two players. The goal in the &ldquo;Lonely in the kitchen&rdquo; game is to collect more victory points at the end of the game than your fictional opponent George &ldquo;The cake&rdquo; (a dummy player).&#10;&#10;Endless Cookbook &ndash; competitive game &#10;&quot;Endless cookbook&quot; game mode keeps all rules from the main game mode &quot;MasterSweets&quot; except the following. Regardless of the number of players create the initial cookbook with a specific form. When a recipe is completed fill the just emptied positions in the cookbook with new cards from the drawing deck. This way the cookbook keeps its initial form during the whole game. The first player that has at least 35 points in his completed sweets is the winner.&#10;&#10;Team Sweets &ndash; team competitive game &#10;&quot;Team sweets&quot; game mode allows you to play the game modes &quot;MasterSweets&quot;, &quot;Clash of sweets&quot; and &quot;Endless cookbook&quot; in team competitive game - 2 players vs 2 players. Before the end of the active player turn, he may pass (only if he want) one card from his hand facedown to his teammate's hand. Before the active player choice of a cart to be transferred is made, his teammate may tell to all players exactly which kind of card he wants to receive. Or may use a code name for example &quot;Please give me a tree&quot; as &quot;tree&quot; is a code name for chocolate.&#10;&#10;The Best Clue - competitive game &#10;In &ldquo;The Best Clue&rdquo; each player holds the cards in his hand facing the rest of the players. The player&rsquo;s goal is to guess 5 cards from his hand. On his turn, the active player may give a clue to one of his opponents in order to receive a special card. He may use this special card to request a clue (from a type that he wants) for his cards from the other players. (The clue types in &ldquo;The Best Clue&rdquo; are the same as in game mode &ldquo;Sweets Workshop&rdquo;). In this way, the player that gives the most useless clues to his opponents and requests the most useful clues about his cards will be the winner.&#10;&#10;Sweets Puzzle - competitive game &#10;In game mode &ldquo;Sweets Puzzle&rdquo; each payer tries to build his own cookbook that is an exact copy of a part of the main cookbook. A player receives victory points from inseparable cards in his cookbook that represent an exact copy of a part of the MAIN cookbook. If in a player&rsquo;s cookbook there are two or more separate groups of cards representing a copy of the MAIN cookbook then the player takes the victory points only from the group that gives the most points. The game ends when any player collects at least 25 points. This player is the winner.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Strike cards are revealed and added to the value of the feint card.&#10;&#10;Normally the highest total wins the combat and deals one damage.

Net (or joker) beats 10. A 1 (or joker) beats Net. And then we&rsquo;re back into the numbers and round we go again.

When one is played, if a player can play the same rank but of an opposite sex, a second trick is formed a la Hattrick. It&rsquo;s a powerful play, because the round then ends the moment either trick gets back to whoever played a currently winning card, improving the odds of you winning a trick. And causing all sorts of calculations as to what the best play is.&#10;&#10;Winning a trick with a net, or someone playing their last card induces a new deal. If you have a crappy hand, let a net win, concede and get a new hand. Otherwise, kick-start it again with a 1.&#10;&#10;In the round that someone wins their tenth trick (you start with 1, so it&rsquo;s actually the ninth trick), the last player to win their tenth trick in that same round wins.&#10;&#10;",

A ball moves on the board as a result of card play by the players (who team up when more than two play).  Kick off, free kicks, penalty kicks, goalkeepers, corner kicks, clearing kicks --it's all in there in a neat, fast-playing package.&#10;&#10;The aim of the game is to score the most number of goals at the end of the game. It plays with cards that allow players to kick the ball and score goals. The game is played in two periods. The first period ends when there are 3 or less cards remaining in the card stack. (same thing for the second period).&#10;Cards can be played in several situation due to severals indications on them.&#10;&#10;    Attack cards: played for the initial kick and during the game.&#10;    Free kick cards that you can play all time (exept to beging a game), and you can play an Attack card after this one.&#10;    Stop cards: To stop goals&#10;    Corner cards: to avoid goal and make the opponent kick a corner.&#10;    One penalty card.&#10;&#10;&#10;According to Lagoon Games this is believed to have been originally produced as &quot;Goal!&quot; in England in the 1950s, and their version is an authentic reproduction of the game&#10;&#10;",

The intersection of the 2 sliders show where you must place you tile.  On your turn you can only move one of the 2 sliders, NOT both.  This limits your placements to a specific row or column.

In each game, multiple tactical 'combo' options allow a player to drain opponents of their dice, while trying to control the wild element 'Z' and convert it to one of the four main elements of Air, Earth, Fire and Water. Each player chooses from four different alien races, Master of a single element, each with variable race powers - in a battle to become the Master Zee. &#10;The game is actually 2-in-1. The 3-4 player challenge game and a very different 2 player tug-of-war game, as players attempt to control the flow of energy and energise the monolith with their element dice. ElemenZ is an easy game to learn but nonetheless offers much tactical depth, easily grasped by both kids and adults.&#10;&#10;",

There are 22 secret locations in game and 20 artifacts.&#10;&#10;Game has few great features;&#10;&#10;     Each player can chose 1 character he will lead.

Each character has 5 stats (Cleverness, Wisdom, Diplomacy, Strength, Navigation)&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     During his travel, player can also use a lot of equipment to enhance abilities of his character. These tools are located on markets around the globe, but once they are obtained, they can give new options to a player. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Many of treasures can be sold. Currency is strong point of the game; walking on foot around globe is not good idea, so player can chose transport with Carriage, Caravan, Train or Ship. Those trips costs - and you can earn money sending your character to work in city.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Game uses two systems created by Jaroslaw Bilinski: TnE and Ocean, which - combined, give great feel and increase players control over his character and actions he takes in-game.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     In some cities player can hire guide and mercenaries to protect him while hi travel to some location. But such party costs a lot of money &ndash;not every character in game is suitable to walk alone into desert without proper gear. &#10;&#10;&#10;Basically, you chose what you like: be it exploring jungle or dig in Piramids, but be sure you have good stats for either, or at least tools and equipment!&#10;&#10;",

Batu Khan usually played one game before a battle, just to get into a right warrior mood. The legend does not specify any particular game but it was most likely Jarmo, an old battle-and-race Tatarian game where players are expected to have concentration, observation and imagination.&#10;&#10;The goal of this game is to reach opponent's first row with as many own archers as possible. However, the winning strategy is more complicated than simple moving pieces towards opponent's base, it will be described in the next sections. Likewise at Tank Battle, the player who gets more points at the end of a game, wins.&#10;&#10;How to capture opponent's pieces&#10;&#10;If an archer moves to a circle occupied by an opponent's archer, this enemy piece is captured and immediately removed from the board. An archer that captures at least one enemy is marked by a small black (white) line. It is important to know which archers have captured enemies when the &quot;loop&quot; rule is used.&#10;&#10;How to finish the game&#10;&#10;The game is finished if one player moves all their non-captured archers to the opponent's first row. At this moment, the final score is calculated and the player with more points wins. In case of a tie, the game is a draw.&#10;&#10;",

Each turn the players are secretly choosing one of the five locations they&rsquo;re heading to. After revealing the cards, the characters can use the special ability connected with that location &ndash; you can rob a Bank, buy something useful at a General Store etc. Unless of course two or more players choose the same spot &ndash; then it comes to a shootout with only one gunslinger winning at the end. The player who have the most money at the end, wins the game.&#10;&#10;Wanted is a fast and fun experience with tons of interaction. Each character has his own set of 5 cards, which allow him to move and are also used during a shootout. Although there&rsquo;s also a luck factor involved with a single dice used to determine the outcome of shooting abilities, each character plays differently and has his own strengths and weaknesses. You can try to get the best items and use them to your advantage, try to avoid other players and steal as much as you can or just go straight into a fight to stop the other players from using the locations&rsquo; abilities. The choice is yours but remember &ndash; this town is really small and you&rsquo;ll eventually find yourself in the midst of a shootout.&#10;&#10;Publisher Note: there's a special 2 player variant included in the box.&#10;&#10;",

Each set contains the same cards! Purpose of the game is to conquer map-cards with ground units, aircraft and ships similar in the mechanics to the Warhammer 40.000 card game.&#10;&#10;Turn sequence is (in short form):&#10;&#10;draw cards phase&#10;place and redeploy cards&#10;attackers attack phase (defender can block)&#10;defenders attack phase (attacker can block)&#10;retreat phase&#10;winning phase&#10;end of turn phase&#10;&#10;The game is only sold in pre-constructed theme decks with 55 cards each. Currently available for the Axis player: A German starter deck (rules included), a German expansion deck. For the allied player: A British and US starter deck (rules included), a British and US expansion deck. The starter decks and the booster packs can be bought in many shops fully translated in English! The last edition fully translated was the Pacific Edition. In German there are a lot more: A Russian and an Italian expansion set, the &quot;Fall Gelb&quot;-Edition with German and French cards, the polish and finnish game packs and the top-seller &quot;Africa Edition&quot; - a box that contains both an axis and an allied starter set. Both are balanced very well and recommended for beginning with HoW. In February of 2009 there came a second box called &quot;Road to Victory: Westfront 1944&quot;. The third starter box edition &quot;Philippines 1944 - The biggest battle of all times&quot; is released in Novembre of 2012.&#10;&#10;Expanded by&#10;&#10;    History of War - &quot;Fall Gelb&quot; Edition&#10;    History of War - Italian Expansion Set&#10;    History of War - Russian Expansion Set&#10;     History of War - Polish / Finnish Expansion Set&#10;&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by&#10;&#10;    History of War - Pacific Edition&#10;    History of War - Africa Edition&#10;    History of War - Road to Victory: Westfront 1944&#10;    History of War - Philippines 1944: The biggest battle of all times (newest edition)&#10;&#10;&#10;From the publishers homepage:&#10;&#10;&quot;Though widely realized in board and computer games a long time ago World War II was till now a dark horse in the Trading Cards (TCG) field. On the o&shy;ne hand it depends surely o&shy;n the fact that the Second World War is a very serious topic which of course does not simplify its realization in a card game, o&shy;n the other hand this very background requires the great historical precision and complexity that seemed difficult to achieve until now.&#10;&#10;The alphaBIT company from Hannover (Germany) takes charge of this problematic topic from now o&shy;n and excels by a balance of realism and subtle intuition. History of War (HoW) presents the Second World War solely as the tactical fight of units.  Retaliatory weapons, atom bombs or personal names like those of generals are deliberately excluded from the game.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is a conquest of land cards that should bring together 15 win points. A means to an end in this case are the mentioned units and the HoW really succeeded to bring together three large parts of a war: fight by land, by air and by sea.&#10;&#10;It makes the game truly particular as even computer games have difficulties in combining these three types of units. As a rule they are divided into land/air or sea/air. In History of War o&shy;n the contrary  the players can use all the units like infantry, tanks, artillery, fighters, bombers, submarines and cruisers in o&shy;ne and the same deck without problems. In addition just like in all other TCGs they can choose freely in a great card pool and make up their own deck.&#10;&#10;There appears another positive aspect  that would please first of all the players with not much means: there is no degree of rarity in HoW. All the cards of an edition are available exactly o&shy;nce in a set which means that a player knows what he buys and already with a few sets is equipped enough for a chosen side. The mentioning of the units provokes the question how they could be paid. The usual  principle in other TCGs  works here as well: some special cards provide the resources. These are called base improvements in HoW. These cards deliver not o&shy;nly the important  technical values (TVs) necessary for payment of units, action cards and effects, but they possess as well useful qualities, so that the mere choice of his base improvements has decisive  consequences for a player. The TVs deliver also the country improvements that can be placed directly in the countries and thus are imminently exposed to the attacks of the enemy, but then dispose of the interesting effects. The units paid with the TVs are played in the so-called deployment zone. The units have different attack and defense values for various areas like land, air and sea. The victory flags o&shy;n the unit cards necessary to conquer the countries are transformed into the win points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;More detailed and profound division of the values, ammunition consumption, moral and so o&shy;n known from other games were deliberately resigned to make a game easy-to handle. Such special characteristics of the units were replaced by useful abilities that make the game fluent and the rules clear. The final transformation of the units into win points is based o&shy;n historical accuracy.&#10;&#10;All the cards show the high quality pictures or even photos of the Second World War and the unit cards are enriched by engineering data. HoW is surely a must for lovers of strategy games, interesting and affordable o&shy;n top of that thanks to the absence of  degree of rarity.&quot;&#10;&#10;You can find lot of pictures and a rule discussion forum on their German webpage: www.history-of-war.com [you can change the webpage language clicking on the UK banner on the left, once in]&#10;&#10;",

The Metis (half Native and half European) set up a provisional government to try and get recognition of their concerns with the federal government in Ottawa.&#10;&#10;The federal government orders a detachment of Mounties to confiscate any weapons located at the Metis settlement of Duck Lake. The Mounties were met by a force of Metis and Natives and initially there was just talk. However, during the course of the discussion a gun was discharged and within minutes, the battle was on! The Mounties retreated, having taken 25% casualties - the rebellion was on.&#10;&#10;To prevent the rebellion from spreading, the government in Ottawa quickly dispatches a military force which would grow to 5,000 troops, most transported by the nearly complete Canadian Pacific Railway. After 4 months and several battles later, the government had successfully suppressed the rebellion - if they had not, and this was their worst fear, the whole Northwest might have erupted in rebellion, keeping the government busy for years.&#10;&#10;The basic military unit in the game is the battalion. All the battalions that participated in the campaign are represented, as are the various Northwest Mounted Police detachments, local militias, artillery, and Gatling guns. They are faced by the Metis, the Woods Cree, and the Plains Cree. Units can remain together as battalions, or they can break down. Morale is better as a battalion, while mobility is better as a breakdown unit. Each strength point represents 50 men. The main rebel and government leaders are represented and they have an important effect on the game.&#10;&#10;The map shows the area of the Prairies in Canada from Edmonton and Calgary in the west to Qu&iacute;Appelle in the east. Map scale is 11 miles to the hex, and each turn represents one week. The map is 22 x 34. There is also a 24 page rulebook, and a number of charts, tables, and organizational sheets as well.&#10; Game scale&#10;Unit sizes:&#10;Battalion&#10;1 Strength Point = 50 men&#10;Each hex equals 11 Miles across.&#10;Each game turn represents one week.&#10;&#10;",

Two or three quests are laid out face-up, and each quest shows the strength of the adventurer party &ndash; in terms of warrior, wizard, cleric and rogue &ndash; required to complete the quest. On a turn, you draw two adventurers cards, then play any number of cards (including zero) &ndash; paying their costs at the same time &ndash; in order to complete quests and gain the income and renown associated with it. When a quest is completed, all other adventurer cards are discarded.&#10;&#10;Why not just hold adventurers in hand until you can send out a massive party all at once? Your tavern is tiny at the start of the game, so you need to keep sending out adventurers in order to make room for more. As you gain renown, though, you'll increase the size of your tavern and have room to hold more adventurers in wait. Champions are special adventurers who fulfill two roles at once, and special action cards bring spice to the game play.&#10;&#10;The first player to collect twenty renown wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "A rift has opened, and unearthly creatures from an alien dimension are streaming into the world. They threaten the planet and the existence of the human race. Defend humankind against the perilous alien invasion as the Marine player! Or, on the other hand as the Portalist player, show those mortals they stand no chance!&#10;&#10;Mission: Combat! is a tactical sci-fi card game for two players, one commanding the human Marines and the other representing the alien Portalists. Both have unique characteristics and abilities available only to their respective faction. In general, the Marines can perform ranged attacks and have strong firepower and good defensive positions. The Portalists, on the other hand, can deploy units for free, and their units can move quickly. Additionally, the area cards of the game board grant special abilities to the player who controls them. When a player manages to eliminate all enemy units on his turn, the game ends and that player wins.&#10;&#10;To set up the game, players determine a start player, draw five unit cards to their hands, and take alternating turns to bring those units into play on their area cards. Then the game begins, with the start player using two action points (AP) in his first turn. In each subsequent turn, players have four action points at their disposal, which can be spent to carry out the following actions in any order as often as desired:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Draw a card&#10;     Play a card&#10;     Move a unit&#10;     Attack&#10;&#10;&#10;In addition to the actions above, players can get free actions and bonuses from the area cards they control and can use special abilities that are available only to their faction only. Units are one of three types &mdash; Regular, Elite, or Colossal &mdash; and can attack only one unit type. For instance, an Elite unit that can deal damage to Regular units cannot deal damage to Elite or Colossal units.&#10;&#10;To achieve victory, players need to consider the defense and attack types of their army, and the faction strengths and weaknesses, along with the abilities that they get from the terrain that they control. Choose your side and wipe your opponent from the surface of the planet!&#10;&#10;",
