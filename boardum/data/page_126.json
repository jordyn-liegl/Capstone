    "description": "The Vote: Suffrage and Suppression in America is a game about voting rights in the United States in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. One player, called Equality, advocates for the passage of two amendments to the constitution. The seventeenth amendment transforms the Senate into an elected body, while the nineteenth secures the rights of women to vote. The opposing player, called Supremacy, not only opposes this, but also seeks to entrench racist methods of voter suppression, intimidation, and discrimination &mdash; structures that will still be in place after the game ends and for decades longer. Equality's victory will be incomplete; it still remains incomplete today.&#10;&#10;This game is something of a companion piece to the same designer's 2018 release, This Guilty Land. It shares many of the same mechanical features: Cards are dealt into and played from a face-up events display, with the function of the card depending upon its type rather than a one-off event. Once used, cards can be taken into a reserve, forming a sort of permanent hand that can be used to act and react. Cards are drawn and kept in reserve according to a player's organizational capacity, which is increased over the course of the game through play of an organization card.&#10;&#10;Special attention is paid this time around to the tension between federal and state politics. It is through legislative victories at the local level that Equality will make passage of its amendments inevitable. Supremacy not only will attempt to oppose these gains, but can even reverse them through judicious intervention of the Supreme Court. Two elements that separate this game from its predecessor are the presence of passive abilities that trigger when a card in reserve remains face-up at the end of a turn and the use of region cards to perform free &quot;bonus&quot; actions.&#10;&#10;If This Guilty Land was about systems that broke in the face of a clear moral evil, then The Vote sees those same systems functioning as intended. Equality can achieve its aims within the system, but so can Supremacy, making the game one of both triumphs and failures.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The action is fast and realistic; the system is easy-to-learn.&#10;&#10;In War Stories you are the commander issuing orders to infantry squads and armored fighting vehicles. Each game presents a scenario using a modular map with different terrain that regulates movement and impacts combat in a unique system that does not require charts or endless modifiers. Players receive a secret set of instructions with hidden deployment and objectives. Unit blocks have a variety of information that regulates their ability to move, fight and remain cool under fire.&#10;&#10;War Stories also offers &quot;rule breaking&quot; asset and event cards. These enable War Stories to have additional complexity with minimal rules weight: the rules and effects are on the cards themselves. Assets are special equipment, troops, and abilities that a player has access to during the battle, such as machine guns, infiltration units, and the ability to lay mines. Events are random things that happen and create memorable moments on the battlefield such as reinforcements arriving, a gust of wind that starts a wildfire, or a damaged vehicle suddenly brewing up.&#10;&#10;ages 14+&#10;1-2 players&#10;(Note: there is no solitaire system; it is a normal 2-player wargame, but the publisher printed &quot;1-2 players&quot; on the box)&#10;60 minutes&#10;&#10;GAME COMPONENTS:&#10;- 5 double-sided mapboards&#10;- 24 double-sided terrain overlays&#10;- 75 painted wooden blocks &amp; stickers to represent vehicles &amp; infantry&#10;- 112 counters (vehicle damage, battlefield damage, fog of war, unit, order and ambush markers)&#10;- 33 asset cards&#10;- 21 event cards&#10;- 24 combat chips and 1 cloth drawbag&#10;- 2 16-page scenario booklets (one German and one Allied)&#10;- 2 player screens/aids&#10;- 1 20-page rule book&#10;&#10;See our sister game War Stories: Red Storm for the most recent info on both games!&#10;&#10;",

But in this battle the US forces were completely surrounded. They had no way of evening the odds at all. But somehow, caused such devastation to the Chinese forces that they had to permanently disband 2 of their divisions and the remaining divisions were still under-strength for 7 months.&#10;&#10;You control the United Nations X-Corps, which primarily consisted of US Marine and Army forces.

In it, you take the part of an interstellar civilization competing to control a newly-discovered star cluster! Construct your empire, fight for resources, and research technology. Each alien species has its own unique flaws and advantages, and victory lies in recognizing this. The game is physically attractive, and includes well over one hundred figures of spaceships, starbases, colonies, alien citizens, and so forth. It takes place in a star cluster built up of individual pieces that changes every time you play.&#10;&#10;The base game has four different alien civs from which to choose, but various expansions and add-ons increase this to 25 total alien Civs (one of which is secret, to be revealed during the Kickstarter campaign). The game does not have any sort of upkeep or victory phase. Instead, when it is a player's turn, they perform three actions, then play passes to the next player. This continues around and around until the game ends, by accumulation of victory points. Most actions cost metal or atomic resources, and include moving, building, research, combat, salvage, production, and so forth.&#10;&#10;As with other Petersen Games products, the game is highly asymmetrical, and the various civilizations have unique abilities, homeworlds, weaknesses, super-units, and super-technologies.&#10;&#10;Driving the strategy are a player's need to advance along the victory tracks. These permit players to score points by advancing along Probe, Research, Industry, and Battle tracks (representing exploration, experimentation, expansion, and extermination).&#10;&#10;The base game supports 2-4 players, but with expansions the game can support up to six players. Unlike many multiplayer games, the game is balanced and works just as well with 2-3 players as it does with 4-6.&#10;&#10;",

Some of the Gallic cards include: Helvetian Migration, German Invasion, and Uprising of Gallic Tribes.&#10;&#10;Combat is resolved using a quasi-tactical procedure. Each side has unique advantages, with Roman discipline pitted against Gallic ferocity. There are special rules for camps, sieges, morale, and great leaders such as Vercingetorix and Caesar himself. Having the right commander at the right battle can mean the difference between laurels and disaster.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Take tricks, organize, never bust.&#10;&#10;TonTon is a trick-taking game with a forty-card deck, with five colors numbered 1-8. You use only three colors of cards for a three-player game, four colors for 4p, and five colors for 5p. The game lasts three rounds, and at the start of each round, you reveal a mission card. The game includes three basic missions and two advanced missions. These missions give you targets that you try to achieve during the round, such as having top cards (explained below) that sum to at most 12.&#10;&#10;Gameplay follows standard trick-taking rules. In a trick, players must follow suit when possible, but they can play any card otherwise. Whoever played the last 4 in a round leads to the next trick; if no one played a 4, then whoever wins the trick leads. When you win a trick, you must take the cards in this trick, arrange them by color with the lowest card on top of each color stack, then place these cards on top of other cards that you've won. Thus, over the course of the game, you'll build up to five color stacks (depending on the number of players) as you take cards.&#10;&#10;When the round ends, you compare the top cards on your stack to that round's mission. If the sum of these cards is higher (or lower, depending on the mission) than the depicted number, then you bust for the round and score only 1 point for each 6 you collected. For all those who didn't bust, players score points based on how their sum compares to others. For the advanced missions, as long as a player doesn't bust, they score points based on the sum of their top cards.&#10;&#10;",

Lovecraft. It is more than just an ordinary board game &ndash; this is a Lovecraftian gaming experience with literary and musical dimensions. Our theme choice was motivated by a deep commitment to the work and heritage of H. P. Lovecraft. We want to create an excellent board game for those who know and love Lovecraft, and we would like to make Lovecraft&rsquo;s work known to those who are board game fans.&#10;&#10;Each round of Cultistorm consists of 6 phases where players combat cultists and try to close 5 portals.  The game is lost if any of the following happens:&#10;&#226;&#151;&#143; Any investigator goes insane. &#10;&#226;&#151;&#143; Any Great Old One reaches a location card. &#10;&#226;&#151;&#143; The number of cultists exceeds the cultist threshold. &#10;&#226;&#151;&#143; The investigators do not manage to seal all the locations before they defeat every Great Old One &#10;after the activation of the Final Act card.&#10;&#10;Additional expnsions include:&#10;- Narrative Expansion and Script Book: the true jewel of Cultistorm is a hardcover book containing 500+ pieces of high quality weird fiction, illustrated with colourful full-page artwork. The Narrative Expansion is a story-driven game mode in which the stories impact the game itself.&#10;- Solo Expansion for those solitary detectives who wish take up the fight on their own.&#10;- Campaign Expansion: seven connected and increasingly challenging scenarios introducing new game mechanics.&#10;- Overlord Expansion: this adds a sixth player who takes on the role of Lovecraft himself. As a puppet master, this player controls the cultists, and thus the whole game.&#10;- Nine minor expansion modules: each of these introduces new game mechanics, increasing the replayability and difficulty of Cultistorm. Most modules can be played simultaneously.&#10;- Game Night Expansion (as add-on): this unique and innovative expansion provides the possibility of combining up to six separate Cultistorm games into one epic story. A common fight, in which the choices of the different teams can impact each other. This expansion was developed specifically for clubs who organise board gaming events.&#10;&#10;",

With fantastically detailed and painted 75mm scale miniatures of the iconic Jaegers &ndash; mechanical guardians of humanity &ndash; and Kaiju &ndash; monsters the size of mountains sent from beyond our world &ndash; it captures the spectacular conflict of the Pacific Rim universe and places it in the palm of your hands.&#10;&#10;Players will be able to jump right into the action as either the PPDC Jaegers or the Kaiju, either in a quick play match of intense combat, or a more constructed battle with both Jaegers and Kaiju using all their skills and abilities to achieve an objective.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is different depending on which side you choose to fight with. As a Kaiju player, you&rsquo;ll uncover a secret objective at the start of the game. To win, you&rsquo;ll need to meet this objective, ideally without revealing what it is to the Jaeger player too early. As a Jaeger player, your goal is to fulfill the PPDC&rsquo;s task: the protection of humanity. You&rsquo;ll need to defend cities as Kaiju trample them, and take down the immense invaders&#10;&#10;The Jaegers and Kaiju each have their own abilities and customisation options. Using the 'Jaeger Conn-Pod&rsquo;, &lsquo;Upgrades&rsquo; can be applied to improve the machine&rsquo;s weapons or other capabilities, while each 'Kaiju Signature&rsquo; can be altered with &lsquo;Mutations&rsquo;, making the monsters even more dangerous and unpredictable.&#10;&#10;During a game round, players control either Jaegers or Kaiju on their turn by playing &lsquo;Action Cards&rsquo;. These represent all-out attacks, cunning tricks, solid defences, secret weapons, and everything else the machines and monsters can do!&#10;&#10;When Jaegers or Kaiju take damage, the player who dealt the damage takes an action card at random from their opponent and reads the Damage section of the card to find out what happens. There's a chance that a critical part of Jaeger machinery, or Kaiju biology, will be struck with massive consequences. The Action Card that was drawn as Damage is then discarded, and cannot be used for the rest of the game. In this way, dealing damage to an enemy not only brings them closer to destruction but can also render weapons or abilities useless.&#10;&#10;When a Jaeger or Kaiju has taken Damage equal to their Structure Points total, they are destroyed! If either the Jaegers or Kaiju are all destroyed, the surviving side will have claimed victory, but winning isn't always that simple. If the Kaiju meet their objective before they are all killed, they win the battle and the PPDC will be forced to retreat. Every Scenario and Objective Card will change the way the battle must be fought and won, often drastically.&#10;&#10;Using these tools, the Jaeger and Kaiju must outwit, outmatch, and overcome their opponent.&#10;&#10;",

In the wake of the cataclysm known as Voidfall, the admirals of the fallen Novarchon Empire formed a desperate contingency plan. To preserve the accumulated knowledge that might one day answer the Voidborn threat, a former imperial flagship, the Revenant was retrofitted to hold the Empire&rsquo;s databanks. Carrying humanity&rsquo;s last hope, and accompanied by ships provided by the Empire&rsquo;s vassal Houses, you must now escort the fleet to safety while managing your influence with the Great Houses and securing your political future.&#10;&#10;Revenant is a standalone, competitive worker placement game of shifting allegiances, set in the Voidfall universe. Players take on the role of rival admirals coordinating the defense of a fleeing starfleet, and competing to earn influence with the factions that stand to survive the journey.&#10;&#10;Across four rounds, players assign crew to ships throughout the fleet, from which they will fight the Voidborn, explore planets in search of resources, upgrade their ship and crew, deploy new vessels, and more. Each ship is affiliated with one of the Great Houses, and each time you assign crew there, you gain influence with that House.&#10;&#10;The journey won&rsquo;t be an easy one. The Voidborn&rsquo;s corrupted forces will continuously attack the fleet, dealing damage to various ships at the end of every round. You can take your part in protecting the fleet by destroying enemy ships, repairing friendly vessels or maneuvering them to safe areas, or ultimately activating the Revenant&rsquo;s hyperdrive to jump to a safer sector. Regardless of your efforts, there will be casualties - you have to make sure that the Houses you have influence in are protected above others.&#10;&#10;Revenant spices up the resource management and engine-building of a mid-weight euro with dynamic tactical challenges, constant player interaction, and shifting allegiances.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "In short, Vanished Planet is a cooperative game with some similarities to Starfarers of Catan.  From the publisher's web page:&#10;&#10;Vanished Planet is a cooperative board game. That means that all players work together to play the game, and either win as a group or lose as a group. It can be played with as many as six players or as few as one.&#10;&#10;Playing the game requires complex strategies involving ship movement, resource management, and technology building, all while trying to delay the creature's progress towards destroying the players' home worlds.&#10;&#10;The difficulty level is scalable, making it enjoyable for everyone from the beginner to the expert. Vanished Planet can be made easy enough for parents to play with their children or difficult enough to challenge the most masochistic hardcore gamers.&#10;&#10;Vanished Planet takes place in a richly detailed game world.&#10;&#10;The past one hundred years had been marked by an unprecedented peace. Humans from the Earth, newcomers to the Galactic Sextant, surprised the Elder Races with their grasp of foreign technologies and their dedication to freedom and peace. With Earth's help, a massive communications and trade network was established. Treaties were negotiated. Disputes were settled and wars became less frequent. The Peoples of the Sextant welcomed the children of Earth and looked toward a brighter future.&#10;&#10;Then, without warning, Earth vanished.&#10;&#10;In its place appeared a writhing mass of darkness. It was impenetrable. It was unassailable. It was without reason. It drank energy like water and consumed all matter it touched. After devouring Earth's solar system, the Creature began stretching massive tentacles across space with terrifying speed, reaching straight toward the homeworlds of the Six Peoples.&#10;&#10;With Earth gone, the communications network all but broke down. Each of the Peoples accused the others of betraying Earth and setting loose the Creature, for each had lost many of their top men and women with the planet when it disappeared. And with them vanished all hope of stopping the dark Creature. In their despair, colonies revolted, workers ran from their jobs and soldiers abandoned their posts in an attempt to flee the approaching darkness.&#10;&#10;It was days before any news came to them. Even the hub satellites that formed the backbone of the network spun silently in empty space. News came in the unexpected form of a single ship; one of the few to survive the cataclysm and return to tell what they had seen. Unlike the other ships, they brought not rumor, but six of those thought lost in the vanishing and their tale was devoid of the speculations the other ships had brought.&#10;&#10;The ship, Hope, raced from home world to home world bringing what truth they knew of Earth's disappearance to their peoples, narrowly avoiding the wars that were preparing to burst forth over the galaxy even as the Creature began groping insatiable tentacles toward them over the vastness of space. &#10; Then the messages came. As one, the hub satellites flickered into life; suddenly and strangely, for the words were not sent by the peoples to one another, but to all six peoples from the the vanished planet Earth!&#10;&#10;Bizarre blueprints for wondrous new technologies were transmitted and strange instructions were given, both for the banishment of the Creature and the formation of a new system for Earth to use when it returned. Time was of the essence. Earth could do nothing and the Creature would soon devour the other worlds if they did not hurry...&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Vanished Planet: Racial Advantage Expansion&#10;&#10;&#10;",

But:&#10;&#10;- If you want to play more than 1 card, you must turn over any one of the cards already on the table. This means, cards are always turned over and played alternately. You cannot turn over or play two cards in a row.&#10;&#10;- You can choose to play your cards &quot;standard&quot; or &quot;blind&quot;. &#10;Standard means you place the card with the side you can see facing up. &#10;Blind means you place the card with the back (that you haven't seen) facing up.&#10;&#10;- Error! If you play or turn over a card in a colour that is already on display, you lose the round. Your opponent receives all the cards in the row.&#10;&#10;- Shadow! If you play or turn over a card in black, you lose the round. Your opponent receives all the cards in the row.&#10;&#10;- Rainbow! If you succeed in playing the 6th card of the row in a colour still missing from the rainbow, you have successfully formed a RAINBOW. As a reward, you receive all 6 cards.&#10;&#10;The game ends immediately when there are not enough cards in the deck for a player to bring their hand back up to 3 cards.

In the game, up to four players are tasked with forming a party of adventurers and combining their powers to defeat a series of bosses. As a cooperative fantasy-themed boss-battle game, players must synergize their abilities and employ effective combat strategies&mdash;via the utilization of items and their characters' unique class abilities&mdash;to defeat a collection of bosses.&#10;&#10;Each character in Wild Hunt Festival has an assigned role (or class) such as attacker, healer, defender, etc. These characters possess their own combat statistics, strengths &amp; weaknesses, and class-specific skills that all must be leveraged throughout each battle and in conjunction with one another to overcome the game's challenging monsters.&#10;&#10;There are two modes of play in Wild Hunt Festival. Story Mode, which is the game's primary play mode, offers a campaign-like progression system where players start at level 1 and take on a series of bosses, leveling between each fight.

    "description": "Your goal in Fickle, an inverse set collection card game, is to build the strongest fairy alliance over five rounds and win the Queen's crown. You do this by keeping fairies in your alliance that gain you favor points. Each card represents a single fairy from one of the five families. Each family has a unique power that enables you to improve your alliance and thwart opponents. Each round, you choose a single fairy, playing it into your alliance tableau, then resolve the family power. Easy, except that with all those powers, fairies don't seem to stay in one alliance for long. They tend to be...fickle.&#10;&#10;In more detail, to set up before the game, players decide which five fairy suits to use in the game from the 22 suits included in the box. In each round, you are dealt three cards; you look at them, decide on the order in which to stack them, then pass that stack to another player. You'll receive a stack in turn, which is in effect a &quot;press your luck&quot; deck created by an opponent. You look at the top card, then decide whether to keep it or discard it and draw the next card, which you can also discard in favor of the third card. Once the &quot;press your luck&quot; draw is complete, each player has one fairy card in hand, which they play into their alliance, then resolve in order starting with whoever played the card with the highest favor.&#10;&#10;After the fifth round, players score each fairy suit in their alliances, and because fairies want equal influence in an alliance, scores are based on an inverse scoring curve:&#10;&#10;&#10;     1 card of a suit: Score its favor value.&#10;     2 cards: Score 0 points.&#10;     3-4 cards: Lose points equal to the card of this suit with the highest favor.&#10;     5 or more cards of a suit: Score the summed value of all these cards.&#10;&#10;&#10;The player with the highest favor score wins.&#10;&#10;",

Vietnamese General Giap directed his communist troops in a concerted attack during Tet (the lunar New Year), successfully overrunning [sic] Hue and starting a bloody battle to retake the city.&#10;&#10;&quot;The battle for Hue was unique, in that it was a medieval city being attacked with modern weapons. The moats and walls presented new sets of tactical problems. The battle was a combination of World War II street fighting and medieval siege warfare, with almost all participants carrying [sic] a fully automatic weapon. If the rules seem peculiar at times, remember that it was a very peculiar battle.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "In the early 17th century the Republic of Venice had predominance in the Adriatic Sea, which for centuries had been subject to its jurisdiction and called the Gulf of Venice, but the Archduke of Austria, a Habsburg who ruled with great autonomy Styria, Carinthia, Carniola, part of the Friuli and many other imperial possessions, did not miss a chance to challenge it. When the raids of the Uskoks, corsars of Catholic faith in service of the Habsburgs, from the Kvarner Gulf to the Venetian routes became more insistent, Venice reacted by triggering a long and bloody war on its eastern borders and in Istria with the idea of putting an end to the raids, defeat the Austrian challenge and to regain the fortress once founded and then lost, Gradisca. Saint Mark's lion roared still ...&#10;&#10;The War of Gradisca 1615-1617 is a simulation game of that ancient conflict, which saw the confrontation of two powers of the era in a political and military context that anticipated the long period of the Thirty Years War.&#10;The game mechanic allows activating units in an unpredictable sequence, enabling uncertainty about campaign outcomes and replayability. Cards introduce political and historical events and allow the development of custom strategies.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Welcome to the city of Slyville, where you become one of the latter kind! As head of a guild operating in one of the world's major trade and cultural centers in the Middle Ages, you will be sending your trusted henchmen to various districts to find trade bargains, make deals, and provide your organization with more power and wealth &mdash; maybe not always in a way that is completely legal, but the end justifies the means, doesn&rsquo;t it? After all, you want to get in the graces of the Prince, right?&#10;&#10;Slyville is a game of pretense and deceit for 3-5 players in which managing your resources matters just as much as your bluffing skills and the ability to figure out the opponents&rsquo; strategy. Try to predict what Goods your adversaries might need, and do your best to upset their plans, but above all, secure the most valuable Deals for yourself!&#10;&#10;In Slyville, the players become heads of guilds operating in a medieval city and send their trusted henchmen to do business and close shady deals. Each turn they have seven cards in their hands and must play four of them onto spaces on the district boards placed in the center of the table. By using their card actions, they bid to acquire goods in five types that can later be spent on deal tiles. If a player has collected the goods required by a chosen deal, they must play a deal card and spend the appropriate goods. Tiles are worth 20-40 points, and the player who gathers 100 triggers the endgame. After that, the rest of the players take their final turn and points are counted. The highest scorer wins and becomes the most influential guild master of the city!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "One of the American Heritage Command Decision Strategy Games, highly prized by collectors.&#10;&#10;This one is the American War of Independence game. The British have four armies of 5 units each, 3 warships and a troop carrier with 2 reinforcements on board. The Americans have 16 units spread all over the board (including a special &quot;Continental Army&quot; unit), 1 warship and a troop carrier with 4 reinforcements on board.&#10;&#10;The Americans use two dice for movement (unless down to just one unit), the British one. All three dice are 0-1-1-1-2-3. Both players roll their dice using shakers and peek at them. The British player designates the unit he'll move, then the American reveals his throw and moves. Finally, the Bristish reveals his throw and moves.&#10;&#10;A single unit is moved by each die --the grid is square and no diagonals are allowed. Units that end up on the same spot stack to form an army (which cannot be split), but each army is limited to 6 units. Naval moves are harbour to harbour except for the troop carriers (and any warship attempting to intercept them).&#10;&#10;A Skirmish occurs when opposing units are adjacent. A card is drawn to resolve the Skirmish. This can result in a unit loss for either side (sometimes two), a major battle being triggered, or one or both armies moving a space or two. Major battles normally occur when an army lands on an enemy army by exact count; numerical superiority is added to the stronger side's throw, and the adjusted throw difference indicates how many units the losing side lost (however, that loss is limited to the number of units in the winning army).&#10;&#10;Once the British have lost an army, they can call for Reinforcements. The Americans can do this once they've won a Major Battle. Reinforcement play is resolved separately from normal play. Two dice are used by both sides, one player trying to bring in his troop carrier whilst the other attempts to intercept with a warship (if the opponent has no warships left, the reinforcements automatically succeed). If the troop carrier makes it to a harbor, the reinforcements land (triggering a major battle if the harbor is enemy-held) and the troop carrier remains as a normal warship henceforth.&#10;&#10;The British win by eliminating the Continental Army, whilst the American wins by eliminating all four British armies. To keep the game from dragging on, if there is no skirmish nor major battle in 10 moves, the weaker side surrenders.&#10;&#10;The asymmetrical mechanics work surprisingly well; the British lacks mobility and try to force Major Battles on the Americans, whilst the latter skirmish as much as possible until they can muster a large enough army together to win a major battle and call in their reinforcements.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Dinosaur Gauge is a pick-up and devour game in which players invest in four different kinds of dino industries, all with an eye toward maximizing the value of their holdings on the Stomp Market. This extremely accurate and rigorously-researched game opens as the Western Interior Seaway shrinks, and with it the fortunes of once-mighty dino shipping magnates. But this paves the way for expansion by dino rail barons, eager to bring goods made at dino factories to emerging dino cities! But even these tyrannosaurus tycoons might find their legends eclipsed by dino airlines.&#10;&#10;Hexagonal tiles are placed on water hexes to shrink the Seaway, and also serve as the timer of the game. Each player gets an equal number of turns in which they place a tile, buy one share of stock, and then take one action &ndash; building for a railroad, making a delivery, producing goods, establishing an airport, or recycling. Each industry works and scores a little differently, and with only a handful of turns, you'll need to invest and act carefully, with an eye toward incentivizing your fellow players to do the hard part for you. End the game with the most money, and you win!&#10;&#10;The first game design by Hollandspiele founder Mary Holland, collaborating with veteran cube rails designer Amabel Holland (Irish Gauge), Dinosaur Gauge is a gleeful game about managing chaos, emergent alliances, and, most of all, how much Mary loves dinosaurs.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

No rock next to meadows, and no mountain tops next to forest or meadows.

There are three items in each category, and collecting the full set earns you a bonus of 5 points.&#10;&#10;Each turn you have two free actions available, to either move, or place a Rifugio (a mountian cabin). Each time an opponent visits a tile with your Rifugio, you get a card with 2 victory points, but they too rest (which is getting a card with an extra action they can use at any time convenient).&#10;&#10;Game ends when all tiles have been placed, and whoever gathered the most points in collecting those cards wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "The object of honeycombs&trade; is to connect your tiles together by matching their symbols. The more matches you make the more points you earn.  The honeybee is wild and can be connected with any symbol. Honeycombs&trade; has three unique ways to play, each varying in speed and competitiveness.  Choose the one that suits your mood.&#10;  &#10;Version A &ndash; Worker Bee&#10;   Fast-paced competition between opponents&#10;   (2-4 players / 2-4 teams of 2)&#10;&#10;1. Divide tiles evenly among all players/teams. &#10;   2 players = 26 tiles each, 3 players = 17 tiles each, 4 players = 13 tiles each&#10;2. Each player places their tiles face-down in front of themselves.&#10;3. On the word &lsquo;go&rsquo; players turn over their tiles and connect as many matching symbols as possible. It&rsquo;s a race to complete your honeycomb before &#10;  your opponents complete theirs.&#10;4. The first player to connect all their tiles together yells &ldquo;HONEYCOMBS&rdquo;. &#10;   This signifies the end of the round and all other players must immediately stop. &#10;5. Players quickly check the honeycomb of the player nearest to them to see if anyone has broken rules 1 and/or 2 (see rules 1 &quot;Single Match&quot; &amp; 2 &#10;   below). If so, deduct points accordingly. However, if the player finishing first is in violation of the rules, the round &#10;   resumes until someone finishes with a mistake free honeycomb.&#10;6. Next, each player calculates their points for the round - (See Scoring) and tells the scorekeeper. The scorekeeper keeps a running tally of &#10;   everyone&rsquo;s points.&#10;7. Return all tiles to the bag to prepare for another round.&#10;8. The player with the most points after 3 rounds is crowned Queen Bee.&#10;&#10;Version B &ndash; One Big Honeycomb&#10;   A leisurely competition, one turn at a time&#10;  (2-4 players / 2-4 teams of 2)&#10;&#10;1. Players take turns to build one big honeycomb while collecting individual points.&#10;2. Draw one tile and place it face up in the center of the table.&#10;3. Each player draws three tiles from the bag.&#10;4. Moving clockwise, players choose one of their three tiles and connects it to the honeycomb. One point is earned for every match made and it is added &#10;   the player&rsquo;s total.&#10;5. After each turn, players draw one tile from the bag to replenish their hand.&#10;6. When all 52 tiles have been connected to the honeycomb, the game is over and the player with the most points is the champion.&#10;7. Some tiles have special powers which are indicated in the center of the tile. To maximize their value, be strategic in how you use them. They are &#10;   only active in Version B- One Big Honeycomb.&#10;&#10;Special Power Tiles.&#10;&#10;Double Points: When playing a tile marked with the Double Points symbol &quot;2X&quot;, all points earned are doubled.&#10;&#10;Steal: When playing a tile marked with the Steal symbol (picture of a masked robber) you have the power to steal another player&rsquo;s turn. Before &#10;               a player lays their tile, yell &ldquo;STEAL&rdquo; to indicate you are stealing their turn. Lay your &lsquo;Steal&rsquo; tile and collect your points. &#10;               Replenish your hand to 3 tiles.  Continue with the next scheduled player.&#10;&#10;Extra Turn: After taking your normal turn, you can play the Extra Turn tile (tile marked with a symbol of an arrow in a circle) &#10;               right away. It is a bonus turn and does not affect your next turn. Replenish your hand to 3 tiles&#10;&#10;Wild Tile: When playing the tile with the &quot;bee&quot; symbol in the center of the tile the player chooses 1 symbol on this tile to become wild. It can &#10;               now be matched with any symbol.  *note: this is not to be confused with the wild bee on the perimeter of the tile.&#10;&#10;Version C &ndash; Honeycombs Puzzle&#10;   Work together to build a creative honeycomb&#10;&#10;1. All tiles are placed face up on the table as you would with a puzzle.&#10;2. Players work together to build one honeycomb.  The object of this game is to make as many connections as possible.&#10;3. Tiles can be moved around at any time, by any player.&#10;4. Work at your own pace as everyone contributes at the same time.&#10;5. When all tiles are connected to the players&rsquo; satisfaction the game is over.&#10;6. This is a non-competitive version; count the total points and record your score if you want.&#10;&#10;Rules&#10;&#10;Rule 1: Single Match (Applies to Worker Bee Version Only)&#10;When a round is finished, only one tile in a players honeycomb can have a single match. A single match is a one that is isolated (the symbols on either side of it are not matched). This means you cannot string tiles together in a train to finish quickly.&#10;&#10;Rule 2: Mismatched Connection&#10;If a mismatched connection is discovered when the round ends, the player must remove the tile with the mismatch without receiving any points&#10;for it. For example, a player may need to remove a tile and forfeits 2 points even though 1 of the connections was a match.&#10;&#10;Scoring&#10;&#10;1 match = 1 point&#10;1 core connection = 5 points&#10;Unused tile = minus 1 point (Worker Bee Version Only)&#10;&#10;How to Score&#10;1. Count your core connection points first&#10;2. Count your matches. To ensure accuracy when counting, points should be tallied while you disassemble your honeycomb. As you remove each tile, count &#10;   the number of matches it has. (see picture below)&#10;3. Minus your negative points.&#10;&#10;Core Connection&#10;&#10;A core connection is a tile that has matched all 6 sides. In the One Big Honeycomb version, the player who placed the 6th and final tile earns the&#10;core connection bonus of 5 points. This bonus is in addition to the points received from the connection(s) themselves.&#10;&#10;",

Some seek action like the brash Astro-Rangers, others desire riches like the fearsome Star Pirates. Some planeteers will to conquer like the horrible alien Blaarg or hunger for honor like the reptilian Zard. Which Planeteers will be the master of the galaxy? That's up to you!&#10;&#10;Rayguns and Rocketships is an action strategy game inspired by the sci-fi classics of the pulp era. The game features fast-paced strategy, pulse-pounding action and over 32 original miniatures!&#10;&#10;Players starts by selecting a Planeteer faction consisting of a rocketship miniature, a rocketship interior map, a crew of six Planeteers miniatures, a captain miniature, a two-sided captain card and a deck of maneuver cards unique to each Planeteer faction. Player place their crew on their rocketship map - in the cockpit, manning the control systems or manning a raygun -  each gives advantages in flight and combat.&#10;&#10;Play is divided into three phases: rocketship movement, rocketship combat, crew movement and combat. Players plot their Rocketship's course using maneuver cards or star cards which are added to the player's hand each turn to provide additional tactical and combat advantages during play.&#10;&#10;As the gigantic rocketships maneuver on the Star Map, they blast away at each other with their deadly rayguns. Crew members can leap out of the airlocks to jetpack into combat with other Planeteers or board enemy rocketships to engage in fierce hand-to-hand combat!&#10;&#10;Points are scored by defeating crew, playing star cards and destroying rayguns and rocketships. The player who reaches the game's victory point goal wins the game and is declared master of the galaxy!&#10;&#10;",

For the audience in Showtime! that wants to enjoy the offered blockbusters and score points, the right seating choice is the all-important factor. They want to avoid having tall men in front of them, children who are blowing bubbles in the middle of the row, or purses blocking neighboring seats. Many moviegoers also have certain preferences. They would like to sit together with their partner, be surrounded by men or women, or sit in the first row. One can only hope that before the start of a show, a riot doesn't break out and chase people away from their chosen seats. Whoever's visitors have had the most pleasure in the cinema after three rounds wins.&#10;&#10;Showtime! (formerly called Film ab!) is an easily accessible, brisk family game with a funny theme that everyone knows from their everyday life.

The terrain analysis includes rivers, woods, rough, mountains, karst, swamp, and impassable mountains. Six-hundred die cut counters represent the military units of the nine nations that took part in the campaign. Units are deployed as individual battalions, regiments, brigades, and divisions - each with its historical designation, strengths, and capabilities. Aircraft units are groups of approximately 40-50 planes organized by type (such as fighter or dive-bomber) and model (from obsolete CR.42 biplanes to Me109's). The Hungarian Duna river flotilla is included; for future Europa use, so are the entire navies of Greece and Yugoslavia.&#10;&#10;The standard Europa rules present a framework of movement, combat, and combat/motorized exploitation.

The Warchief checks the battlefield, then tries to choose the right order with a card in hand. When both clans have chosen their cards, all of them are revealed, and if both cards match on a clan, then the order is carried out. Some examples of orders: loading the catapult, firing with the catapult, progressing toward the Queen, looking at hidden cards in the middle to find the Queen, and avoiding traps...&#10;&#10;Of course, within a clan it is absolutely prohibited to make any sign or say anything to help the partner to guess which order is intended.&#10;&#10;When playing 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-2, the game is a bit different: The single player team cannot play the same order twice, one turn after another.&#10;&#10;With multiple copies of Goths Save The Queen, you can compete in a 3-vs-3, 3-vs-4 or 4-vs-4 format.&#10;&#10;",

You shall go and find me the greatest army of 7 watchmen who will protect the Tree of Destiny. One of you who will manage to assemble the best army, will be given a great fortune.

Each player competes in an armored racer equipped with an assortment of &quot;accessories&quot; not commonly found in your average Auto Parts store. Road hog won't let you pass? No problem&hellip; debate the right of way with a burst of your front machine-guns. Annoyed by that tailgater? &hellip;a few well-timed grenades should scrape him off your bumper. Reckless passer? &hellip;well, if your smoke screen doesn&rsquo;t discourage him, a nudge from your scythe-blade hubcaps should do the job. And these are just the &quot;standard&quot; accessories. In the Advanced Game, you can customize your car into something even James Bond would envy.&#10;&#10;Running low on fuel &hellip; better pull into the next Rest Stop, but beware of sabotage or theft. Only losers nap during RoadKill. Besides, what better time to salt the track with tire spikes or change a road sign or two. Everything goes in Roadkill, an uproarious game of highway combat more vicious than the Santa Monica Freeway.&#10;&#10;Players vie for the lead so they may lay the next section of the course. For example, a player with a Nuclear Fuel Cell will want to lead the others on a merry chase through mountainous terrain to sap their fuel. However, someone already running on fumes will opt for a desert straight-away to finish the race before he must pit and relinquish the lead. But pole position has its price-attracting more than its share of misfortune, while slipstreaming provides opportunities back in the pack.&#10;&#10;As if the players don't heap enough mayhem upon each other, the game throws an endless series of monkey wrenches into play as cars breakdown, the road widens and narrows or comes to a temporary stop in a blizzard, rock slide, or drawbridge (or does it?). You never know what is around the bend in Roadkill.&#10;&#10;",

Using the same rules as Fear God & Dread Nought, a novice can begin playing within a half hour of opening the box using the specially designed Jump start scenario.&#10;&#10;Dawn of the Rising Sun follows the same format as Clash of Arm's other rules used in the Admiralty Trilogy, making them easy to follow for experienced gamers, and novices alike.&#10;&#10;Tactical turns represent 3 minutes, with intermediate turns (for long distance maneuvering and long stern chases) representing 30 minutes. Gun hit probability is based upon a combination of factors such as visibility, range, target size, number of rounds fired at the target, and the speed of the firing and target platforms.&#10;&#10;Damage is a function of the type of shell, number of barrels firing and armor of target, and is easy to calculate also. Blank ship forms allow the player to list all the ranges and damages of his ship's particular guns in advance, making it quick and easy to calculate both damage and hit probability. Critical hits are a function of the amount of damage taken last round vs. the amount of damage able to be taken. Critical hits are typically scored against systems (engineering, bridge, steering or individual weapon mounts).&#10;&#10;Each scenario has its own map, showing the disposition of forces. In addition to the well known battles such as Port Arthur, Yellow Sea, and Tsushima Strait, several smaller battles are included. The scenario book is full of original after action reports as well as helpful sidebars on a wide range of topics. The Data Annex is complete for all the ships that were involved, as well as including line drawings of the major combatants and additional source material, making it a valuable reference in itself.&#10;&#10;Step onto the Admiral's bridge and see if you will sustain or reverse history.&#10;&#10;Russo-Japanese War contains:&#10;FG&amp;DN Rules&#10;RJW Data Annex&#10;Scenario Book - 20 scenarios plus numerous sidebars and articles.&#10;2 countersheets, 210 ship, and 140 markers (land based guns, searchlights, fires, torpedoes, etc.)&#10;&#10;",

The board is 5x6 squares, so it's a shorter game than regular Shogi, aimed at getting children even more interested in Shogi after they've outgrown the original D&#197;&#141;butsu Sh&#197;&#141;gi.&#10;&#10;Goro-Goro Dobutsu Shogi not only has a bigger board (goro is a contraction of go roku which means five six in Japanese, a reference to the board, as well as goro being onomatopoeic for purring) compared to Dobutsu Shogi, it also adds in some more rules of the full Shogi game:&#10;- Reaching the other side of the board with your lion no longer wins you the game. Only capturing your opponent's lion does.&#10;- You can't have two of your own chicks in the same column/file.&#10;- You can't drop a chick for mate.&#10;&#10;Taken from the publisher's website:&#10;&#10;The cute animal pieces are now combined with Goro-Goro Shogi, a small shogi on 5x6 square board. This is a very good next step for everyone who has played Dobutsu Shogi.&#10;&#10;The rules of Goro-Goro Shogi was invented by Japan Shogi Association, and is widely known to be a very good variation of shogi to learn important concepts in shogi, such as handling the generals effectively, importance of promoting a pawn, and mating the opponent's king with successive piece drops.&#10;&#10;Cats and dogs run and play in this small board. Highly recommended. Please have fun!&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Inside Pitch Baseball Game:&#10;&#10;ISG is proud to announce Inside Pitch Baseball.&#10;&#10;This game is based upon the Defense Independent Pitching Statistics, developed by V&ouml;r&ouml;s McCracken.  This is a statistic that operates under the revolutionary and controversial theorem that a pitchers value comes from his strikeouts, walks, and home runs allowed (because these are the only events over which the pitcher has total control).&#10;&#10;Each at bat starts on the pitchers card and while one of the outcomes from above (K, BB or HR) may come into play each batter has the final say.  The game includes split LH/RH ratings for all pitchers and hitters with at least 40 BF/AB against each side. Defensive plays such as range plays and errors are interwoven into the game so as to make it seamless.  All action comes from the players cards so outside chart lookups to determine the outcome of at bats are a thing of the past.&#10;Hitters are not left out as they are rated for where they actually hit the ball in the year represented.  Base running, stealing and bunting can be handled by the game engine for the solitaire player as well.&#10;&#10;Ballparks play a big part in IP.  Now each park will have its own card (look just like a hitter card)  that is referenced during game play.  Ballparks will be represented on more than just HRs allowed.  All hits, strikeouts and walks will be affected by the place a game is being played.  Just by looking at the ballpark cards you will see that the Astrodome will yield few HR chances while Coors Field will earn its rep as the launching pad.&#10;These ballpark cards have been seamlessly added to the game as well by not requiring any outside lookups.  They have also give the opportunity to add rare plays and the &quot;trying to stretch&quot; hits in the game.&#10;&#10;We have completed a sample game run through that shows how the game plays along with pictures to guide you the IP game play.  It can be found at http://forums.delphiforums.com/ISGF/messages?msg=214.1 .&#10;&#10;IP takes a unique approach to simulating the game of baseball.  From where you start with the pitchers card to how the defense gets involved the game just feels right.  So forget the 50/50 setup, forget the chart lookups and step inside the game of baseball with Inside Pitch.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "It&rsquo;s the most wonderful time of the year! Time to open up the boxes of Christmas decorations, untangle the lights, replace broken bulbs, and decorate the tree. To have a bit of fun, you&rsquo;ve decided to compete with your fellow decorators to see who can build their sets of lights the fastest. Sift through the bulbs, exchange information, and arrange them in the right order as you trade and build your strands. Ho ho ho!&#10;&#10;Players swap, play, trade and draw Christmas Light Bulbs into their own sets of lights in an attempt to be the first to complete two sets.&#10;&#10;The main game is designed by Adam Collins and Chad Head.

    "description": "The Ball and Chain Game is an abstract game for two. The oblong board contains hexagonal spaced holes for the ball-shaped pieces to rest. Each player has one large Guard and five pairs of smaller Prisoner pieces. Each pair of Prisoners is connected by a metal chain: two short chains and three long. A Prisoner may move as far as the chain will allow (1 or 2 spaces) while its partner stays put. The opponent's Prisoners may be temporarily immobilized by crossing one of your chains over theirs. The Guard moves one space at a time in any hex-axial direction. If, on your turn, you are unable to move your Guard, you lose.&#10;&#10;",
