Its market has become one of the most popular on the coast, and merchants are fighting to be able to install their stalls. Competition is tough to make a fortune, especially since the customer is demanding. This requires having well-stocked stalls to attract the wealthy customers and increase its reputation. But be careful not to incur the wrath of the consul as this could cost you. However, you can always count on the gods and goddesses to give you a boost, with, of course, some offerings. And yes, everything is paid in this world ...&#10;&#10;In Massilia, each player will be able to use different colored dice to perform actions. There are four different colors corresponding to four different actions. On his turn, a player can choose a die and perform the corresponding action: Buy goods at the port, move a client or the consul on the market, make offerings to divinities to recover bonuses (cards), and buy reputation. The value of the die shows the number of times that the action may be made. The goal is to obtain the highest reputation at the end of the day by setting up stalls on the market to sell goods at the best price that the player will have bought in port.&#10;&#10;",

(That piece symbol will light up, and the next piece - yours if playing solitaire or your opponent's - will blink.) There are five levels of difficulty - the time allowed to drop each piece is less at the higher levels. The 60 plastic pieces slide down grooves in the clear window, and you flip levers on the edge to show when a row is complete.&#10;&#10;",

Both challengers spin in turn, and the first to get a ring wins; if the challenger wins, the loser loses a bone.  If the challenged wins, the challenger loses two bones.&#10;&#10;",

Bl&ouml;ff, is a bluffing card game along the lines of Cheat and Bullshit in which players take turns laying cards into a central stack and making claims about what they played. As long as the next person in line doesn't call their bluff, they're off the hook!&#10;&#10;To start a round, each player receives a hand of 5-12 cards, depending on the number of players; cards range in value from -2 to 7, with a handful of special cards also being present. A limit card shows a 7, with players playing clockwise. On a player's turn, he lays one card face-down on the table, adds the number on that card to the sum announced by the previous player (if any), then announces the new sum; the player can play any card and state any sum, as long as it's not higher than seven. The next player has the option of playing a card (under the same circumstances) or calling the previous player's claim. If he does this, reveal all of the cards and sum them, with action cards counting as zero. If the claimed sum is correct, the doubter draws two cards from the deck and starts the next round; if not, the previous player draws two cards &mdash; even if he played honestly on his turn. As soon as you make a claim, you're responsible for what everyone played before you!&#10;&#10;Actions cards can be played face-up for their action, and they allow you to give one card from your hand to another player, force someone to draw two cards, force an opponent to play her next numbered card face-up, or change the direction of play while simultaneously flipping the limit card; when first flipped, the limit changes to 5 and players must now abide by that limit.&#10;&#10;The deck also contains three gloating &quot;Larry&quot; cards, and if one or three Larrys are in the central stack, then a player's claim of a sum is always correct!&#10;&#10;When a player runs out of cards, the next player can doubt the total or let it stand. the player who went out scores 2 points, while everyone else loses points equal to the number of little Larry symbols on cards still in their hand. After three rounds, the player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;",

Once you win an auction of the items that match each of your Curio cards you win the game. Item cards represent the items you can find for sale on the eBay website. During the game Item Cards are auctioned off to the highest bidder. There are 2 types of Bidding Cards: Money Cards and Action Cards.&#10;&#10;First the Curio Cards are dealt according to the number of players ... 3 or 4 players = 5 Curio Cards each ... 5 or 6 = 4 Curio Cards each. Second the Item Cards are dealt face up in a row ... 3 or 4 players = 4 Item Cards each ... 5 or 6 = 5 Item Cards each. Third, each player is dealt 5 Bidding Cards. One D6 die is then placed on each Item Card matching the number showing on the die to the Number of Rounds field on the item. Finally, each player rolls a die. The highest roll receives the &quot;Starter&quot; Card and goes first.&#10;&#10;One complete round of play consists of one turn per player and an Auction Update Phase. During each player's turn, they may perform any or all of the following actions in any order: 1) Draw hand back up to 5 Bidding Cards, 2) Discard one Item Card won on a previous turn to draw 3 Bidding Cards, 3) Either 3a) Play 1 Action Card and/or place 1 bid on an item, 3b) In lieu of placing a bid and/or playing an Action Card, you may discard as many Bidding Cards as you like. You redraw at the beginning of your next turn.&#10;&#10;When each player has taken a turn, The &quot;Starter&quot; Card passes to the left.  After this, starting with the first Item Card, the die on each Item Card is lowered by one. When a die reaches zero, the auction is finished and all bids are revealed. Players may, at this point, play Action Cards which are allowed during this phase.&#10;&#10;Action cards: Know Your Enemy, Bad Money Order, Tastes Change, Mass Amnesia, Offshore Financing, Lost Connection&#10;&#10;Cards played during Auction Update Phase: Expensive Shipping, Reserve Price, Bad Feedback&#10;&#10;You can change the length of the game by adding or subtracting the number of Curio Cards available.&#10;&#10;(Most of the above was taken directly out of the rules sheet that comes with the game. Personal note: Some of the Item Card titles and flavor text is pretty funny and some are just plain &quot;cute&quot;.)&#10;&#10;",

As soon as the other players hear the word &quot;Dingo&quot;, they must put their hands on top of the calling player&acute;s hand as quickly as possible. The last player to put his hand down must give one of his chips to the winner (the hand at the bottom).&#10;&#10;The game continues until the conditions agreed at the beginning of the game are fulfilled, or the player with the highest number of chips is the overall winner.&#10;&#10;",

Players answer questions in five categories as they move around the game board, attempting to collect four film frames tokens and then return to the start position. The game has questions in the following categories: Directors, Who's Who, Quotes, In the Movies, and Reel Knowledge. Answering a &quot;Directors&quot; question gives a player a special card which will allow him to either jump directly to one of the film frame squares or get a second chance to answer a question during one of his turns.&#10;Mad About Movies! covers a wide range of movie trivia including films from the late 90s when it was published. Many questions provide optional multiple-choice answers to allow people with different levels of knowledge to play. The game is  played with 2-4 players or teams, with a recommended minimum age of 12 years.&#10;Mad About Movies! contains a game board, die, four player tokens, sixteen film frame markers, a box of cards containing over 1500 questions from more than 700 movies, and a Directors card divider.&#10;&#10;",

Strategy, maths, probability and bluffing combine to make this a game unlike any other.&#10;&#10;How to play&#10;&#10;Each wizard holds nine spell cards numbered from one to nine. As our wizards are more &quot;Greedy&quot; than &quot;Gandalf&quot;, their spell-casting abilities leave a little to be desired -  making their spells a little on the unusual side. The game's incantations include things like summoning an &ldquo;absolutely massive chicken&rdquo; or &ldquo;a woman who shouts hurricanes.&#10;&#10;Players take it in turns to secretly select and then lay three spell cards face down, either side of a duel token. This is repeated until each wizard has played all nine of the cards they hold. Duels are resolved by adding up the total value of cards - with the wizard with the highest winning that particular scrap. Win two duels out of three and a piece of cake becomes theirs.&#10;&#10;However, three pieces of cake are needed to win the game - and because our Wizards are Greedy, they value cake over spells. Winning a piece of cake means discarding a spell card. And as the cake cards are double-sided, the opposing wizard can see exactly when they are being played. When cake is in play, the game becomes one of strategy, bluffing and probability - do you have what it takes to get your cake and eat it?&#10;&#10;Beautifully illustrated, easy to learn yet full of decisions and intrigue, it&rsquo;s a game which can be enjoyed by any level of player. As long as they are greedy.&#10;&#10;",

There are numbered tiles of wood on the board in three rows and three columns - where one player controls the rows and the other the columns. In secrecy the players choose a row and column, and the attacking player takes the tile in the intersection between the selected row and column. Then the other player become the attacker, and so on. At the end of the game the player whom have collected the tiles with the highest numbers the most points! A totally brilliant tactical game!&#10;&#10;Novem - ein Taktikspiel f&uuml;r 2 Spieler &ndash; einfach, aber brillant!&#10;&#10;Wer schafft es, nach zwei Partien mehr Punkte zu erzielen als der Gegner? Auf dem Spielfeld liegen neun Zahlensteine in je drei Reihen und Spalten. Ein Spieler kontrolliert die Reihen, der andere Spieler die Spalten. Geheim w&auml;hlen die Spieler in jeder Runde eine Reihe und eine Spalte aus. Der Angreifer gewinnt den Stein, der am Kreuzungspunkt der ausgew&auml;hlten Reihe und Spalte liegt. In der n&auml;chsten Runde wird der Gegenspieler zum Angreifer.&#10;&#10;Novem ist ein taktisches Spiel, f&uuml;r das Sie keine mathematischen Kenntnisse brauchen &ndash; aber einen klaren Verstand und Nerven aus Stahl!&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "The board is a map of the world divided into 6 areas each having 4 harbours. Each player owns a ship.&#10;&#10;The game proceeds in two phases. &#10;In the first phase the object is to trade and acquire wealth as quickly as possible. To that purpose, each player sails from harbour to harbour: in a harbour a commodity can be bought [wheat  - gold - wood - cloth - wool - fruit] &ndash; in some harbours no goods can be bought.&#10;Sailing can be short distance &ndash; form harbour to harbour which are connected by dotted lines or long distance using a &ldquo;Long Course&rdquo; card.&#10;Selling goods can take place in any harbour &ndash; player rolls the dice which determines which good can be sold &ndash; always at three times the cost.&#10;Using a &ldquo;Storm&rdquo; card a player can organise a storm in one of the six areas forcing the ships in that area to leave behind their goods in the harbour &ndash; available for the next ship that visits the harbour.&#10;The ships will return again using the dice as this determines to which area the ship will return &ndash; player can choose the harbour.&#10;When 2 ships are going to the same harbour the 2 captains need to fight each other using &ldquo;Squabble&rdquo; cards damaging the opponent more and more [pretty funny descriptions]. The loser of the fight looses his money.&#10;However, cards played do NOT return so there&rsquo;s limited supply. And you will definitely need some of these later in the game.&#10;&#10;The second phase starts as soon as a player is rich enough to acquire the corsair ship &ndash; the corsair ship is auctioned with a minimum cost. The player will then try to eliminate all of his or her adversaries. The dice decides in which area the Corsair ship starts. On the turn of the player &ldquo;owning&rdquo; the Corsair ship he can sail 3 steps &ndash; as opposed to the other players who can only sail to the next harbour. The &ldquo;Long Course&rdquo; cards are very valuable now.&#10;When the Corsair ship catches a player&rsquo;s ship that&rsquo;s the end of it: goods return to the bank and the owner of the Corsair gets the money. The Corsair ship has done its job and returns to the bank &ndash; available for another player to buy it.&#10;The Corsair ship is sensitive to the &ldquo;Storm&rdquo; cards and will sink.&#10;&#10;The winner is the one remaining player.&#10;&#10;The rules are simple, but the characters are limited in what he/she can do each turn. Also all eliminated players have to wait until there&rsquo;s a winner and are no longer participating in the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "It is the year of our Lord 1603. The Uskok Warlord Radoslav died during the last Venetian raid. All the Uskok leaders, including you, were invited to Nehaj, the unconquerable Uskok fortress, in order to choose their next Warlord.&#10;&#10;Dark storm clouds loomed over the stone fortress, its walls battered by the bitter nothern gales, and yet the Uskok leaders could not come to an agreement. Mighty warriors though they were, none of them had proved to be enough to their comrades, so no Warlord had been chosen. As midnight struck, the debate was cut short by a shot from a flintlock. The hall went silent. The old sea dog Stipe spoke: &quot;According to ancient customs, if no agreement is reached by midnight, the title of Warlord shall go to the first lord who collects enough loot to fill twenty-five Uskok vessels.&quot; So it was written, and so it was done.&#10;&#10;Uskoci were a historical pirate band in the 16th century who lived and prospered by being a nuisance for much more powerful opponents, but never on such a scale to provoke full-scale retaliation. Uskoci: The card game of Croatian pirates takes that idea of heart as players need to demonstrate both their skill as a pirate and restraint comparable to the historical Uskoci to prove the best captain among your peers.&#10;&#10;In the basic game, players must combine treasures (valued 1-9) on their pile until they total exactly 25; what makes this difficult are the 14 event cards (Venetians, traitors, storms) that can mess with a player's plans or change the value of a treasure, but thankfully they can also protect you. The more complex game adds card drafting to the mix, with the player who has the least treasure on the table drafting the most cards.&#10;&#10;The rules in both games are for 3-6 players, with modifications that allow two players to go head-to-head.&#10;&#10;",

Valiantly they made their way down to depths of the Earth and readied themselves to defeat the dragon, hoping to earn glory and riches &ndash; but the mighty creature was waiting, breathing a blast of heat and fire upon them, leaving only their boots!&#10;&#10;No one will remember the tale of these unlucky heroes except the hapless group of awestruck hirelings now standing in Rovert's lair, frozen with fear. Feeling helpless as the dragon moves closer and curls his tail behind them, the survivors tremble. The snorting dragon crawls right up in front of them, but instead of breathing fire, it opens his mouth menacingly, as if to draw another breath &ndash; or maybe to eat them! At that moment, the bravest of the group yells, &quot;Run!&quot;&#10;&#10;In an instant, the terrified hirelings scramble away, seeking the quickest way out of the dragon's lair. Unfortunately, that's not the way the heroes brought them in, but a new escape route fraught with danger! Their only hope of survival is to use their quick feet and the items strapped to their backs. Unfortunately, they are not too bright (and not very fast) and they have no clue how anything they're carrying might help them. Will they make it out? Only you can determine their fate...&#10;&#10;Hirelings: The Ascent is a board game for 2 to 6 players who become the frantic escapees, trying to find and fight their way back above ground.

It&rsquo;s up to you to commission a brave officer of the Royal Navy to pursue that black-hearted cur, catch him, and turn him into shark bait. But he&rsquo;s a rascal, that Pirate King, so you&rsquo;ll need to recruit one of the dregs of the Queen&rsquo;s dungeons because sometimes it takes a pirate to catch a pirate. Iffn&rsquo; you discover where that swab is hiding, you&rsquo;ll need to beat the Pirate King in a duel or acquire enough gold to buy back the ship. Act with haste because you&rsquo;re not alone in this hunt. Whoever saves the Sea Hammer first wins the Queen&rsquo;s undying gratitude - and the game!&#10;&#10;Here's a description of the game from Timothy Rose, who saw a presentation on the game at GenCon:&#10;&#10;The &quot;S&amp;S&quot; pirate game is a &quot;track&quot; based game (think &quot;Talisman&quot; more than &quot;Monopoly&quot; ). Each player controls two characters, a &quot;hero&quot; and a &quot;scoundrel&quot; type, and the goal is to retrieve the Queen's flagship from the Pirate King. Of course, each character has different ways to do that, either by derring-do and combat or by more underhanded methods (if you have enough gold, you could even BRIBE the Pirate King to get the ship back!). They showed the box design, pretty standard pirate/cutlass stuff, but nice art.&#10;&#10;",

Roll the bat die to see what color bat you have to add on your turn. You may be lucky and have to place a small one or not so lucky and have to place the biggest bat of all. As each player goes, the weight of all those bats begins to tug on the top bat so, be careful! If your bat is the one that makes them fall, you get a Bat Token. When a player has 3 Bat Tokens they're out of the game and the player who has the fewest Bat Tokens at that time wins!&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "The premise is quite simple: jump out of airplanes and get your guys to land as close to the coast as possible. The closer you are to the coast, the more points you score. If you splash down into the water, however, you will score negative points. The further from the shore you are in the water, the more negative points you will suffer. &#10;The board depicts a section of land, followed by a beach and ocean. There is a lake on one space of the land section, and a one-space island in the ocean. The board also has two 'landing' tracks running parallel to each other. The tokens are placed on these tracks once they have leapt from the planes. Finally, the board also has a scoring track to tabulate the points ultimately scored following a round, as well as a cumulative scoring track which runs the perimeter of the board.&#10;&#10;Each player loads his or her tokens (which vary with the number of players) into the two airplanes. There are four rows of seats in the airplanes, and where your tokens are positioned will be important when considering the timing of your jumps. Players then each receive six cards plus one 'jump' card. These cards dictate the actions that will occur during the turn. Most of the cards move one of the planes (red or yellow) forward or backward a certain number of spaces. Other cards allow a player to switch seats in or between the planes, cancel any jump attempts that round or blow a jumper off course a space. Finally, the jump card causes one of the player's token to leap from the plane and land on the space directly below where he was seated.&#10;&#10;The mechanics are quite simple. Each player lays a card face down, and then all reveal their cards simultaneously. Beginning with the start player (which rotates each round), each player carries out the action his card depicts. However, if a player reveals a 'jump' card, then opponents who played a 'wind' or 'cancel jump' card must reveal them, taking the appropriate action. The 'wind' card can be disastrous, as that player gets to bump the jumper one space up or down. This may have the effect of landing the jumper in the water. Cards played are discarded, with the exception of the 'jump' card, which is retrieved back into the player's hand.&#10;&#10;When a token leaps from a plane (due to the play of a 'jump' card), he is placed on the outside track of the landing track. If another token leaps into the same space, it is placed along the inside track. Any other tokens that land on that same space are shoved back to the next empty space on the landing track. This can result in a scoring reduction if the token is being moved further from the coast, but can also be a positive occurrence if this causes the token to be moved onto the land as opposed to falling into the water.&#10;&#10;Play continues until all tokens have jumped from the planes. They are then moved one-by-one to the scoring track, beginning with the token furthest from the shore. There is a positive scoring track for those tokens that were fortunate enough to land on solid ground, and a negative scoring track for those jumpers who splashed into the water. The more tokens that successfully landed on the ground, the more points the players closest to the shore will score. The converse is also true!&#10;&#10;Once all tokens have been repositioned onto the scoring tracks, each player tallies his final results and these are marked on the cumulative scoring track. This entire process is then repeated two more times and the player with the most cumulative points following the third round is victorious.&#10;&#10;",
