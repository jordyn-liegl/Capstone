    "description": "Korona (Finl.) and Couronne (occasionally also Koronn, Swe.) is versions (with very minor differences) of Carrom played in Finland and Sweden and to some extent in the other Nordic countries. The game is considered to have evolved from American Carrom early in the 20th century.&#10;&#10;As early as the 1930's regular competitons were held at famous departement store Nordiska Kompaniet (NK) in Stockholm, but since the war (WWII) no Couronne contests took place until they were revived in early 21st century in the Swedish provinces of Scania and J&auml;mtland. The former being student activities (often at Blekinge nation - a student organisation with very old roots); the latter being an un-official world championship.&#10;&#10;Like in Carrom, there is a wooden square shaped board usually less than 1 meters wide. The idea of the game is to hit small round pieces with a bigger piece into corner pockets. In this Nordic version you use cue sticks to hit the big stone instead of using your finger which makes Korona / Couronne even more similar to billiards than the Carrom.&#10;&#10;The pockets are typically larger than in Carrom but there's some space between the pockets and the edge of the board. Therefore it's possible for a piece to go behind the pocket which can sometimes cause some extra trouble.&#10;&#10;In Finnish Korona, during the setup, the pieces of each player are placed in a tight row against the wall on the opposing side of the board instead of a pattern in the center. There's no bonus pieces in this game. Because all the pieces are separated according to their color, it's possible for a skillful player to put all the pieces in a pocket with only one strike.&#10;&#10;Each player in a three or four player game may play with their own colors instead of forming teams with opposing players.&#10;&#10;The Swedish version Couronne is similar in that it typically has space behind the pockets and uses cue sticks, but the pieces (usually 15 of each colour) are initially placed in the middle.&#10;&#10;Minikorona is a space-saving version of this game.&#10;&#10;H-ring spel is a Dutch version that has similarities to this game.&#10;&#10;",

Vigilante brings social deduction, action management, and tableau-building into a unique combination that leaves you with many different paths to take to accomplish your goals, new strategies and synergies between heroes, and a lot of tension!&#10;&#10;There are a variety of scenarios (game modes) depending on player preferences. The game plays in rounds, where players have 4 actions to either fight (and imprison) villains, recruit new heroes, search for equipment and other helpful cards, or heal. Afterwards, players secretly roll their dice and contribute one of them, which sometimes will help the group but usually hinders them.&#10;&#10;In Brought to Justice, each player gets a secret role. 'Good' players represent the majority and must imprison 7 villains per good player before the end of the game (i.e. if there are 2 Good players, they need a combined total of 14). 'Evil' players are trying to foil their plans, and Neutral players have independent missions which generally throw a little chaos into the mix.&#10;&#10;Shifting Allegiances takes Brought to Justice and creates even more uncertainty by only guaranteeing one 'Good' player, while the rest of the mix could be any combination of 'Good', 'Evil', or 'Neutral' players. Even though there's a possibility that all players are good, it will take time to gain each other's trust, and you could end up sabotaging your own victory!&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Regine is a card game of betting and bluffing, designed by Dani G&oacute;mez and Josep M Allu&eacute;, the author of games like The Color Monster, Castellers!, and Dragons &amp; Chickens.  It is illustrated by Bea Tormo.  It&rsquo;s for 2 to 4 players ages 10 and up and games last around 30 minutes.  Regine brings us back to the European courts of the end of the 16th century and the goal is to be the first player to reach 31 points.&#10;&#10;Watch your backs&hellip;because the daggers are flying!  In Regine the interaction among players is constant and the majority of the effects of the cards affect the hands of your rivals.  As the game progresses, each player tries to get the best combinations to score points but they don&rsquo;t always have control over their hands.&#10;&#10;The intuitive card design makes it quick and easy to learn how they function.  And if you know how to play Mus, some of the rules will seem familiar.  Rounds are structured in 3 phases:  hand construction in which players try to get the most favorable card combinations, a betting phase where they bid on the best hands, and point resolution.  To start, put the 4 scoring cards in the middle of the table alongside the betting chits.  Shuffle the remaining 40 cards, deal 4 face down to each player, and put the rest in the middle of the table.  You&rsquo;re now ready to start the first phase!&#10;&#10;In a turn, a player can do 1 of 4 actions.  The first is change one of the cards in their hand for the top card of the deck.  The second is to announce &ldquo;no changes,&rdquo; which blocks the rest of the players from changing cards from the deck.  The third is play a card either face down or face up on the table.  If a card is placed face up, it may trigger an action.  The jester, for example, negates a &ldquo;no changes&rdquo; declaration previously made by another player.  The peasant forces a player to play a card face up on the table and use its effect.  The assassin eliminates a card that has been played on the table, the courtesan forces a player to reveal a card that has been played face down, the herald lets one look at the top card of the deck and the knight forces one to change a card from their hand.  Finally, each player can also pass and when all players pass, all remaining cards are placed face down and the betting phase begins.&#10;&#10;Be sharp and observant, because it&rsquo;s now time to bluff!  Taking turns, the players will bet on the scoring cards.  They&rsquo;ll bet on the highest number of queens and jesters, on pairs and trios of cards, and for the total value of their cards.  It&rsquo;s not always necessary to have the best hand in order to score points!  You can always trick the other players into thinking you have better hand than you really do.  In the last phase, the resolution, all cards are revealed and points are awarded.  Rounds continue like this until a player reaches 31 points.&#10;&#10;A good memory and a big dose of shrewdness will be your best allies in Regine, ensuring quick games and hours of fun.  Families and friends, young and old will enjoy this game (try playing with your grandparents or card playing in-laws and they&rsquo;ll quickly get the knack).  So move with caution among the knights and courtesans and don&rsquo;t get caught with the wrong cards!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "At the turn of the 16th century in Japan both the Emperor and the tycoon lost control of the country &ndash; the time when pushy and ambitious daimyos to subdue islands, the time for strong warriors to demonstrate their boldness and great warlords to show their art, the time when cunning secret agents decided a battle of the clans.&#10;&#10;In the tactical card game Shinobi: War of Clans players will take on the role of secret agents of the most powerful clans of feudal Japan. The aim of the game is supporting your clan with military advantage; the clan which has the most troops at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game each player gets a clan card which shows what clan the player will belong to and four troop cards from the deck. The area before the player (his table) presents one of Japan&rsquo;s provinces, so the more players the more provinces. The players take turns clockwise from the starting player. Each player&rsquo;s turn consists of the following orders: the troop deployment order, the troop movement order and the attacking order. During his turn the player must place a card from his hand on any province except his own one. If by the end of his turn in his province he raised the army (some troops of the same clan) which is stronger (more numerous) than any other army in any other province, the battle is unavoidable. It will be impossible to stop the warlike samurais from attacking but there is an opportunity to direct them to the proper side.  Once there are no more cards in the deck players take a final turn and come in true colors (reveal their secret cards). Clan cards are summed up and the player with the most cards of his clan in all the provinces wins the game.&#10;&#10;What&rsquo;s feudal Japan without ninjas! Without them no game about Japan can be complete. The ninjas&rsquo; function is obvious &ndash; to shorten the number of warriors from the enemy clans.&#10;&#10;From 3 to 5 players can take part in the game. The tactics of the game changes depending on the number of players. You will need careful calculation to win in a five-player game; fans of bluff and &quot;psychological&quot; game will like the game with three participants. The game seems simple at first sight, but believe or not, keeping your clan in secret, guessing which clans your rivals play for and making them to play into your hands is not simple at all.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Simulation of the Seven Days' Battles which started Robert E. Lee on the road to glory.&#10;&#10;The setting is the Union&rsquo;s Peninsula Campaign in the spring of 1862.  McClellan has formed and trained a large army, transported it by sea in an outflanking maneuver, marched it to the gates of the Confederate capital, and is poised to capture the city and probably bring an end to the rebellion.  On the Confederate side Lee has taken over the Army after Johnston was wounded.  Unlike Johnston, who was content to fight a largely defensive campaign, Lee gathered every unit he could get his hands on and launched his own offensive.  The Union had placed its army in an awkward position, with one corps north of Chickahominy River and the rest south of it.  Lee&rsquo;s plan, and the position of the units when the game starts, was to crush the Union Corps and then drive the rest of McClellan&rsquo;s army from the capital, destroying as much of it as he possible could.  With that accomplished he would have a free hand to turn north.&#10;&#10;The system is a simplified version of two games, the last area-impulse Avalon Hill published, Breakout: Normandy, and MMP's Monty's Gamble: Market Garden.&#10;&#10;The game features leaders who are rated for initiative and combat effectiveness. Another mechanism in the game is the &ldquo;advantage&rdquo; marker which can be traded to the opponent to do things like rally, conduct a combined assault, declare a heroic defense that turns a success into a stalemate, or receive additional replacements.&#10;&#10;The victory conditions are based on territorial control.  For the Union that was Richmond.  For the Confederacy that was the Union supply heads &ndash; White House Landing and Harrison&rsquo;s Landing &ndash; and Malvern Hill.  A key decision for the Union player is when to shift his supply train from White House Landing to the more secure location at Harrison&rsquo;s Landing.&#10;&#10;The unit scale is divisional including artillery and cavalry.&#10;&#10;There is the campaign game, and a few optional rules.  Playing time should be under three hours between experienced players.&#10;&#10;",

It's not often a straightforward path from 1 to 9, so the real strategy comes from knowing what cards can best counter your best opponent, and secure your place on the Throne. For example:&#10;&#10;The Assassin has a low value of 2. But as a trained killer, she immediately can assassinate any King she can find. Thankfully, there are other cards to help, such as the King's Hand (by stepping in the way) or Inquisitor (who can preemptively force the Assassin out of the darkness with a pointed finger).&#10;&#10;The Soldier has a middle of the pack value of 5. They tirelessly fight for the King throughout their lives, and now they're confused to which King to serve. If they follow their leads and prove their suspicions, they grow more potent on the Throne.&#10;&#10;The Queen/Princess sits comfortably in the upper echelon of society with the highest value of 9. They push around all members of the Court with their thoughts, and very few can stand up to them. However, characters like the Elder (value 3) can remind the Court that no one is above the law. Or perhaps an Oathbound (value 6) will step up to the Throne. These mysterious beings are the Kingdom's most revered members and may brush anyone aside to share their agenda. And of course, the King can always take matters into his own hands...&#10;&#10;Fight viciously with your allies! Bluff and deceive others about what you may have! Assassinate all that stand in your way! Foil plans by forcing your opponents hand! There are a fantastic amount of possibilities, and you have to try to fulfill your objective while hindering others.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Espa&ntilde;a 20 features two complete games covering key battles fought over control of the Iberian Peninsula.&#10;&#10;Considered one of Wellington&rsquo;s finest battles, Arapiles 20 (July, 1812) from Lance McMillan focuses on the hard-fought meeting engagement between his veteran British forces and Mareschal Marmont&rsquo;s French army in the hills south of Salamanca. With two armies of equal strength, victory requires careful planning, precise maneuvers, and exact timing to take advantage of the opportunities offered by unexpected events. Will the British player be able to pounce on a fleeting French blunder to win the day (as happened historically), or will the French be able to simply bludgeon his opponent into submission? In Arapiles 20, the outcome of this famous battle is in your hands.&#10;&#10;Hans von Stockhausen's Bail&eacute;n 20 (July, 1808) showcases the stunning triumph of General Francisco Casta&ntilde;os&rsquo; Spanish army over French General Pierre Dupont&rsquo;s Corps d&rsquo;Observation operating in the mountains of Andalusia. This game challenges both players: The Spanish must struggle to coordinate the actions of their large and enthusiastic but mostly untrained army, while the French must decide whether to try and hold against superior numbers or conduct a fighting withdrawal back to Madrid. With Spanish guerrillas, a baggage train full of looted treasure, and treacherous Swiss mercenaries who might change sides in the middle of the battle, Bail&eacute;n 20 offers players plenty of military adventure.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "In Das Labyrinth des Pharao, players are graverobbers who want to go as deep inside a pyramid as they can, preferably discovering chambers that contain treasures along the way.&#10;&#10;Each player starts the game with 28 identical tiles and a 5x5 grid  representing a pyramid. Players each add the same tile to the grid each turn, slowly creating (if all goes well) a winding labyrinth inside the pyramid. When a player places a tile that shows one or more scarabs on it, he can choose to place a treasure marker on one or more scarabs. By the time that the third tile is placed, each player must decide which entrance to the pyramid his figure will take.&#10;&#10;The game ends once the 5x5 grid is filled. Each player counts the length of the corridor that extends from his starting point, scoring one point for each space in this path. In addition, the player scores two points for each treasure that's surrounded by four walls as long as at least one of those walls abuts the corridor walked by the graverobber. Whoever has the highest score wins!&#10;&#10;Das Labyrinth des Pharao includes rules for solo play as well as an advanced variant in which treasures are worth 1-3 points depending on their color, with this point value then multiplied by 1-4 depending on where its shared wall meets the corridor. The deeper the treasure along the path, the more points it's worth.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Veletas is a drawless territory game for two players: Black and White. It is played on the spaces (squares) of a 10x10 checkered square board, which is initially empty. Apart from the board, the necessary material comprises seven shooters and a sufficient number of black and white stones.&#10;&#10;Both players control a number of neutral red pieces and shoot stones of their own colour from them. In order to win, a player must claim a majority of neutral pieces by having them surrounded by larger groups of their own pieces than their opponent's.&#10;&#10;This game won (along with Four) the BoardGameGeek Best Combinatorial 2-Player Game of 2013 Award.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;DefinitionsA group is a set of one or more like-colored, orthogonally adjacent stones. The size of a group is the number of stones in it. Stones on top of shooters are not part of any groups.&#10;&#10;A trapped shooter is a shooter that cannot make any legal move in the current position.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;PlayThe first player begins by placing three shooters and one black stone on empty squares of the board. The second player then chooses which player will be Black and which will be White. Next, White places the remaining four shooters and one white stone on empty squares of the board. In both cases, no shooters can be placed on the perimeter of the board. This restriction does not apply to the rest of the game.&#10;&#10;From then on, the players take turns, starting with Black. On your turn, you may (but are not obliged to) move a shooter to an empty square in a straight orthogonal or diagonal line, without jumping over any stones. Then, you must place a stone of your color on an empty square that is a straight orthogonal or diagonal line away from the square onto which the shooter was moved (or from any shooter, if none was moved), with no stones in between along that line. This is called shooting. Claimed shooters (see below) cannot move or shoot. Note shooters can move and shoot over claimed or unclaimed shooters.&#10;&#10;After shooting, if there are any trapped shooters on the board that have not been claimed before, each one of them is claimed by the player who owns the biggest group orthogonally adjacent to it. If there is no such group or the biggest such groups of each color are the same size, the shooter is claimed by the opponent. Claiming a shooter is indicated by placing a stone of the corresponding color on top of it. Claimed shooters remain unchanged for the rest of the game.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player has claimed the majority of shooters, i.e. at least four of them. That player wins. Draws are not possible.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Smaller versionsFor shorter but still reasonable games, the following variants are suggested:&#10;&#10;&#10;     7x7 board with three shooters. The first player places one shooter, and White places the other two. Whoever claims two shooters wins.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     9x9 board with five shooters. The first player places two shooters, and White places the other three. Whoever claims three shooters wins.&#10;&#10;&#10;Online Play&#10;&#10;&#10;     Board Game Arena (real time, turn-based)&#10;     Boardspace.net (real time, AI option)&#10;     igGameCenter (real time)&#10;     AbstractPlay (turn-based)&#10;&#10;&#10;Mobile Apps&#10;&#10;&#10;     Boardspace.net local multiplayer or online, IOS&#10;     Boardspace.net local multiplayer or online, Android&#10;&#10;&#10;",

With the high cost for every bird you hatch, it probably won't be worth it in the end. You can't tell at the beginning of the year which of the six bird varieties will do best, and beware the birds with exceptional plumage! If they thrive, they can be worth big money &mdash; but if they go wrong, they can bankrupt your ranch.&#10;&#10;In Emu Ranchers, a Decktet game for two players, each bird on your ranch is represented by a stack of cards. Cards in a single bird stack must all share a suit and must be in rank order. At the end of the hand, the value of a bird is determined by the total of the number cards in the stack. If the total is too low, then you can end up losing money on a bird. An Ace or Crown makes the stack worth more: more profit if you can cover expenses, but more loss if you can't. The object, naturally enough, is to raise profitable birds.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "On October 6, 1973, Egyptian forces, lavishly equipped with the latest Soviet weaponry, launched a surprise attack in overwhelming strength against the 436 Israeli infantrymen and 200 tanks that were guarding the Suez Canal.  The Egyptian onslaught was spearheaded by seven divisions and over a thousand tanks - with another three divisions and 300 tanks in reserve around Cairo.  Despite these long odds, the Israelis believed they would be able to repel the assault with relative ease.&#10;&#10;Within 72 hours, the assumptions that formed the foundation of the Israeli strategy - the defensive value of the Suez Canal, the absolute superiority of Israeli troops, and the decisive role of the Israeli Air Force - were proven to be shockingly, undeniably mistaken.  First of all, the Egyptians, displaying an unexpected mastery of engineering technique, built no fewer than ten bridges over the Canal by the end of October 7 - an achievement which enabled them to pour tanks and other heavy equipment across much faster than the Israelis had thought possible.  More shocking yet, every Israeli counterthrust had been thrown back, with appalling losses.  Those supposedly inferior Egyptian troops did not falter in the face of the immediate and violent Israeli counterattacks, but bravely stood their ground - knocking out better than 300 Israeli tanks in the first three days of the war.  Finally, when the Israeli Air Force was sent to the rescue of the hard-pressed ground forces, it ran into an almost impenetrable wall of antiaircraft guns and SAMs (including the hitherto unknown - and very deadly - Soviet SA-6s) that took a dreadful toll of the attacking Phantoms and Skyhawks.&#10;&#10;History tells us that the Israelis managed to overcome the initial consequences of their own hubris and overconfidence, and reverse the course of the war, through a combination of sheer guts, brilliant improvisation, and superior technique in mobile warfare.  Yet, the outcome of the war along the Suez Canal was, to quote Wellington, &quot;A very near run thing,&quot; that might easily have ended in a humiliating Israeli defeat.&#10;&#10;TIME SCALE    12 hours per turn&#10;MAP SCALE    2.5 miles per hex&#10;UNIT SCALE    Battalion / Brigade&#10;NUMBER OF PLAYERS    One to four&#10;PLAYING TIME    Two to twelve hours&#10;&#10;",

Can you help the wolves build the highest house and find the best home for them?&#10;&#10;Three Little Wolves is a family game in which each player needs to build three houses by playing cards from small numbers to large.

Plans, disguises, and a pinch of luck in your hand are all you need to win the game!&#10;&#10;In more detail, players take turns playing one card from hand to build one of the three houses &mdash; blue, green, and red &mdash; in front of themselves, then refill their hand to four cards. If the Big Bad Pig (BBP) is drawn, it rewards the tallest house at that moment, but if you can't keep the house tall enough at the end of the game, you will get punished. If you don't want to play a card, you can discard a card and send one of your three wolves to live in other players' houses for a chance to score points!&#10;&#10;The third time the BBP rewards the tallest house triggers the end of the game. All players compare the height of their buildings, and the shortest of each color is knocked down by the BBP! Whoever scores the most points wins!&#10;&#10;",

In the Adventure Time episode &quot;Card Wars&quot;, Jake begs Finn to play his favorite trading card game. Finn accepts, despite warnings from Beemo on how very competitive Jake can be while playing the game. Finn and Jake battle against each other to decide who will be the Dweeb and who will be the Cool Guy.&#10;&#10;Now fans can play the actual Card Wars game in Adventure Time Card Wars: Lemongrab vs. Gunter, with all of the action taking place in four combat lanes.&#10;&#10;Each turn, a player has two Action Points to spend on Creatures, Spells, and Locations, and cards cost between 0 and 2 Action Points to play. When you summon a Creature, you choose which lane you want to place it in; some Creatures have FLOOP abilities that allow you to use their special abilities. When you attack with a Creature down a lane, you might find an opposing Creature, or you might get to deal your damage straight to your opponent's Hit Points. Reduce your opponent's Hit Points from 25 to 0 and you're the Cool Guy (and you win the game)!&#10;&#10;In Adventure Time Card Wars: Lemongrab vs. Gunter, The Earl of Lemongrab and his sour disposition take on the cool as a cucumber penguin, Gunter! Lemongrab's deck contains cards that utilize SandyLands and Cornfield Landscapes. His new strategies include giving his opponent bad Creatures that take up space and mess up his opponent's combat phase. Keeping your opponents Creatures alive might just be your key to victory! You will also find new &quot;bounce&quot; Creatures that can enter and leave play at a moment's notice. And this deck can mess with your opponent's Landscapes!&#10;&#10;Gunter&rsquo;s deck utilizes IcyLands and Blue Plains Landscapes. As a penguin, Gunter likes to hang out on the ice. Now he can! His deck has brand new ways of putting Frozen tokens on Landscapes...and this time, he might want to freeze his own! When his Creatures occupy Frozen Landscapes, they will be much more powerful. Of course, if he wants to get rid of the tokens he will need a lot of cards in hand. Blue Plains is still the king of card draw. Blue Plains is also the best at moving Creatures between Landscapes. You will find that ability very useful with Frozen tokens hanging around! You will also find some very powerful Blue Plains Creatures that must move each turn, or suffer the consequences.&#10;&#10;Each Card Wars starter set has a pair of different forty-card decks and is ready to play right out of the box. Mix the decks together to come up with your own righteous combos!&#10;&#10;",

The other player controls the Germans and tries to prevent it, or failing that, to grab a source of supply in one of the surrounding Allied colonies.

Each player has a unique set of campaign cards generating movement, combat bonuses, historical events, and reinforcements. Playing the right card at the right time lets one side concentrate the forces needed to win that great victory against all odds, or perhaps go down to inglorious defeat. Combat is resolved using a quasi-tactical procedure in which units take turns firing at one another.&#10;&#10;Skills:&#10;&#10;     Level: Battalion&#10;     Hex: 85 miles per inch&#10;&#10;&#10;",

A single token of a third color called the Neutron starts in the center of the board. To win, either surround the Neutron or move it to your baseline. On a turn, a player does these two actions in this order:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Move the Neutron: Move it any direction to the furthest vacant square possible without leaping over other tokens; if you can't move it, you lose (because the other player has surrounded it).&#10;    Move one of your tokens: Move it any direction to the furthest square possible without leaping over other tokens.&#10;&#10;&#10;On the first turn, the starting player skips the Neutron move.&#10;&#10;Neutron was invented by Robert A. Kraus and first appeared in 1978. Bobail is nearly identical to Neutron, except in Bobail the Neutron can only move one vacant adjacent space. The publishers of Bobail claim that it's a traditional African game that pre-dates Neutron, but there is no evidence to back up this claim.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "publisher's description&#10;&#10;Breaking the Chains (BtC) simulates a hypothetical future military conflict over the South China and East China Seas around the year 2021. Conflicting claims of sovereignty have roiled those &quot;near seas&quot; since the Cold War. After decades of patient diplomacy, Beijing's new navy could offer military options for finally asserting sovereignty over prizes within the First Island Chain - that string of islands which runs from the Ryukus south through Taiwan, the Philippines and then curls back to the mainland via Malaysia. BtC presumes that China comes to blows with a Southeast Asian country in a conflict that could expand to possibly include: Australia, India, Japan, the United States as well as a variety of Southeast Asian nations. However, beyond China and one South East Asian nation, the exact composition of opposing coalitions is not predetermined but rather a function of the decisions players make as the game unfolds.&#10;&#10;Two or more people play BtC with two reference cards, dice, and about 350 counters on a 22&quot; X 34&quot; map where each hex spans about 70 nautical miles (80 land miles) and each turn represents one day of real time. Players alternate maneuvering air, ground and naval units for up to 14 nations to resolve battles with a universal &quot;strike&quot; mechanism that applies across all types of combat; missile defense capabilities are central to survival. Air units represent from 30-90 aircraft each, most ground units are regiments, and naval units are small groups of surface ships/submarines or individual aircraft carriers. Specialized chit play simulates black ops, cyber warfare and various political developments.&#10;&#10;BtC is solitaire friendly. The naval operations which dominate play are based on a roll-to-evade model rather than search-to-find model. That means, owing to a battle space awash in electromagnetic emissions, enemy positions - except for motionless submarines - are assumed to be known unless a last-minute dice roll determines a potential target has evaded detection. So there is no &acirc;&#194;&#128;&#194;&#156;hidden movement&acirc;&#194;&#128;&#194;&#157; to stifle solitaire play; and the &acirc;&#194;&#128;&#194;&#156;hidden placement&acirc;&#194;&#128;&#194;&#157; of submarines can be forgone. Finally, the special chits that govern black ops can be played at random to further enable solo game play.&#10;&#10;",

Lee, the other acts as Maj.Gen. Joseph Hooker (until June 28th) and then Maj.Gen. Geore G. Meade. Movement determined by command points which is determined by quality of leaders. Rules include the variables of replacing Hooker with Meade. There are two identical maps with each player having one and hidden from each other. Players will need to search out the other's army by using cavalry and pickets. Victory is determined by destroying enemy units and capturing or defending real estate. Two additional scenarios: The Great Invasion (starting on turn 14), and Lee vs. Meade. Optional rules cover Rain, Bridge Burning, Naval Movement, Piccett Goes West, and Reynolds Takes Command.&#10;&#10;A complete game will take about four hours to play, but the additional scenarios can be finished faster.&#10;&#10;125 counters, two 17&quot;x22&quot; maps, two sheets for battleboard and Turn Record, 14 pages of rules.

The main goal is to breed, exchange and gather different animals (rabbit, sheep, pig, cow, horse and two kinds of dogs) and the winner is a person who can gather at least one of each kind (except the dogs). But be careful there are foxes around trying to snatch your rabbits and wolves which can eat all your other animals (that is why you need dogs to protect your herd).&#10;&#10;The game was designed, and originally named &quot;Hodowla zwierz&#196;&#133;tek&quot; (&quot;Animal husbandry&quot;) in the occupied Poland during Word War Two by famous polish mathematician Karol Borsuk and his wife. In these hard times the game became very popular and there were many home made copies sold by the Borsuks family. Sadly during the Warsaw rebellion at the end of war all copies were destroyed save one that was in another city. After the war it was returned to the Borsuks family. Now one of the Polish publishers decided to release the game.&#10;&#10;The turn of each player consists of two actions: first you have a possibility to exchange your animals according to the special table (e.g for six rabbits you get one sheep, three pigs for a cow) and then you roll two special 12-sided dice with the pictures of animals on the sides. You count the number of pairs of the animals on rolled dice (together with the ones on the farm) and this is how many new animals you get, divided by two. The trick is that there is a fox on one dice and the wolf which are eating your animals.&#10;&#10;The game is mostly based on the luck factor (dice). But there is a little strategy to it. Do you go for more &quot;expensive&quot; animals (which have less probability of creating offspring) or you stay with fast breeding but &quot;cheap&quot; rabbits. Do you exchange your animals for an &quot;insurance&quot; (dogs) from the foxes and wolves or risk in order to catch up with others farmers?&#10;&#10;Game was intended for children but surprisingly it is also fun for adults.&#10;&#10;Reimplemented by:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Have You Herd?

    "description": "Western forces in Vietnam soon realised that traditional military strategies and tactics would not win the war. Jungle based guerilla warfare required a different approach. Part of the tactical revision involved using smaller teams of men going deep into enemy territory. Intelligence gathering was extremely important in Vietnam. Development of the Long Range Reconnaissance Patrol followed. In fact, the concept was not new and similar methods had been used many years before in the American Revolutionary War and in World War II amongst others. In Vietnam, the LRRPs (pronounced Lurps) usually consisted of around six men. They worked closely as a team, were heavily armed and generally did whatever was necessary to get the job done. Their aim was to remain undetected if possible. Working deep behind enemy lines, as well as reconnaissance they carried out a variety of mission types.&#10;&#10;In this game you will control a LRRP as they are dropped in the jungle, carry out their mission orders and then proceed to the extraction zone. The death of any member of your team will result in instant defeat.&#10;&#10;This game book is a solitaire wargame. You play the game, and the enemy is controlled by the game book (or the Artificial Intelligence). You will need around a dozen standard six-sided dice.&#10;&#10;&mdash;descripion from the designer&#10;&#10;",

V-2, Hitler's Wunderwaffe, a ballistic missile able to wipe London from the map and win the war, bringing Britain to her knees. But the deepest secrets of German war technology are revealed by the UK's staunchest allies - the Poles...&#10;&#10;Czas Honoru: Operacja Most III &ndash; a.k.a. Days of Honor: Operation Wildhorn III &ndash; is a fast-paced, tactical card wargame for two players. The first player takes the role of the Polish commander. His goal is to collect fragments from rockets test-fired from the German missile base. The second player takes the role of the German commander and is trying to protect the secrets of the rocket testing area.&#10;&#10;The game lasts four turns. Each turn begins with a missile test, which scatters new fragments of the rocket in the peripheral area surrounding the testing ground. Players alternately take turns during which they place their units on the table and perform actions. Players use scouts to collect missile fragments, but they need to be protected by soldiers and partisans because enemy contact can lead to combat. These actions are supported by elite units: Polish Unseen and Silent commandos and German SS Stormtroopers, who are able to penetrate enemy lines. In addition, players build a network of command and support units, which allows them to effectively carry out their actions.&#10;&#10;Players also affect the course of the game during their opponent's moves, playing cards for immediate effects. And each side has a set of unique events, e.g., Germans can use their logistical advantages while Poles can hide, and even evacuate rocket fragments to England! To determine combat and exploration results, players each use a six-sided die, but they have many opportunities to modify the results, so a good plan should work even with bad luck.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, the player with more rocket parts wins. This means the player successfully stole (Polish) or concealed (German) the secrets of the V-2 weapon.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Justinian is a strategic level board-wargame game set in the early 6th century, after the collapse of the Western Roman Empire and the burgeoning of the Byzantine Eastern Roman Empire.  The Byzantine Emperor, Justinian I, has started his reconquest of the Western Roman Empire, and the game attempts to simulate his endeavor for players to emulate.&#10;&#10;One player takes on Justinian's role, the other coordinates the Barbarian faction (basically the non-Byzantines); the designer also said the game can be played solitaire.  The two factions' design are asymmetrical.  Each turn, the Byzantine has to manage its finances, gaining income by taxing its controlled provinces and spending the money to raise and maintain its armies.  Then the Barbarian and Byzantine factions alternate with each other to take actions (one at a time).  They can raise more armies, move the troops, or do nothing.  Whereas the extent of the Byzantine faction's orders are certainties, most of the Barbarian faction's are random; i.e. dice rolls sometimes determine how many armies join the Barbarians and whether these armies join the Byzantines instead.  Both sides conquer territories by moving their armies into the lands.  If two armies meet, combat occurs, which is resolved by dice rolls and cross checking the results with tables.  The game features mutinies, naval actions, and random events.  The latter throws up revolts, removal of generals and plagues.&#10;&#10;The game ends after 10 turns or after a second plague has erupted.  The Byzantine faction has to control a certain majority of the empire by that time to win.  The game also ends if the reconquest was accomplished much earlier.  If the Byzantine faction is unable to win when the game ends, the Barbarian faction is the winner.&#10;&#10;&#10;JUSTINIAN is a game covering the reconquest of the Roman Empire by Justinian I, Emperor of Eastern Rome (Byzantium). Justinian&rsquo;s reign represents Byzantium&rsquo;s high water mark; his conquest of lands is exceeded in Roman history only by that of Augustus and Trajan.&#10;&#10;Players. The game may be played by two players, or solitaire.[...]&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the rulebook&#10;&#10;",

At the same time, you aspire to brew beer that's the best of the festival &mdash; but these two elements do not always go hand in hand.&#10;&#10;That&rsquo;s why players have to examine what the market expects from their beer, which styles are in current trend, and what festival critics like. As if that was not enough, the world in which we brew beer is alive! Shifts on the beer market change trends and critics taste. The market set-up is unique each time, so you need to manage your resources wisely and follow carefully the market and other players' actions.&#10;&#10;Beer Empire is mainly based on a set-collection mechanism as players compose recipes using a variety of ingredients (resource tiles) like light and dark malts, hops, fermentation type (open or closed) and type of container (bottle, can, barrel or keg). Each of these components may add different effects and influence on quality of beer.&#10;&#10;     Increase/decrease beer attributes  (aroma, color, taste)&#10;     Produce more or less bottle caps (market share)&#10;     Add extra points&#10;&#10;&#10;What ingredients we&rsquo;d use, thereby what effects in our beer we&rsquo;d get influence all game areas:&#10;&#10;     Market (area control), represents what consumers expect from beer. Some prefer aromatic beer, some prefer to drink from bottles, other ones favor specific style (India Pale Ale, Bock, Pilsner). Players brew beer that meets several tastes thereby achieve points from different markets at the same time!&#10;     Beer Festival(bidding &amp; combo):  Here matters especially aroma, color, taste. These characteristics are assessed by the critic. He assign festival points and it&rsquo;s worth effort because only at the festival you can win rare brewing passion tiles!&#10;     Trends: In Beer Empire world there are few main beer trends (Pilsner, Bock, India Pale Ale, Lager and ALE). Brewing beer compatible to the trend gives you experience tile that opens new great possibilities for brewing!&#10;&#10;&#10;What is most important, it is up to you and your abilities of smart resource management (tile placement &amp; worker placement) and right recipes composing,  which direction you&rsquo;ll go. Would you accomplish goals in all fields or you&rsquo;d focus just on chosen elements?&#10;What we want to underline is that each of these elements influence on each other making every play one of a kind.&#10;&#10;It seems it&rsquo;s gonna be a really hard work to build your Beer Empire.&#10;&#10;(Espa&ntilde;ol)&#10;&#10;Beer Empire es un juego competitivo para 2 a 4 jugadores que asumir&aacute;n el papel de due&ntilde;os de peque&ntilde;as cervecer&iacute;as que tendr&aacute;n que crear sus recetas, obtener recursos, ampliar su industria y construir su propio imperio de la Cerveza&#10;&#10;Los jugadores se convierten en due&ntilde;os de peque&ntilde;as cervecer&iacute;as, aut&eacute;nticos entusiastas de la cerveza, que luchar&aacute;n ferozmente para hacerse con el mercado y competir por el reconocimiento de su habilidad artesana en los festivales de la cerveza.&#10;&#10;Para poder conseguir sus metas, crear&aacute;n recetas de cervezas que elaborar&aacute;n asegur&aacute;ndose de que tenga los rasgos correctos.

The German player is generally on the offensive, attempting to win the game by isolating or capturing Moscow, or by seizing all the other key cities on map. The Soviet player is primarily on the defensive, but the situation also requires that he prosecute local counterattacks.&#10;&#10;Play encompasses the period that began with the Germans launching their offensive on 1 October 1941 and ends on 7 December of the same year. By that time it had become clear the invaders had shot their bolt without achieving their objective. Play may end sooner than the historic termination time if either player concedes defeat prior to the official end of a game.&#10;&#10;Each hexagon on the map represents 7.5 miles (12 kilometers) from side to opposite side.

    "description": "Around 800BC China was blossoming as a civilization. The Zhou emperor sat on the throne of a feudal China and ruled through wise philosophers, able warlords, and a strong army. The Chinese world was making huge cultural, scientific, and philosophical strides.&#10;&#10;But a single generation later, those same advisors and lords rose up against the throne, and each other, to claim hegemony for their philosophy and way of life. Welcome to the Spring and Autumn period of ancient China.&#10;&#10;Spring and Autumn: Story of China is a 4X civilization game in which you take control of one of the pre-eminent states of the time to explore the world around you, expand your borders, research powerful advancements, build up your economy, and bring honor upon your name. Your goal is to establish a true dynasty in China.&#10;&#10;Spring and Autumn: Story of China expands on the system from in Hellenica: Story of Greece, introducing all-new gameplay elements like a philosophy system, diplomacy, enhanced combat, honor, expanded victory conditions, the Great Wall, and did we mention Chinese dragons? As with all &quot;Story of&quot; games, Spring and Autumn: Story of China will include the best AI and solo play system available in a 4x game.&#10;&#10;Can you guide your civilization during these turbulent times? Will your vision of Chinese civilization be remembered for all time, or will you merely be a stepping stone for another&hellip;?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "VOR is a science-fiction miniatures game that takes place inside a mysterious galaxy-sized anomaly (VOR) of unknown origin.  The anomaly randomly sucks worlds (and their inhabitants) through time-space and once in the VOR, all worlds drift toward the center (the Maelstrom) and their doom.  The inhabitants of the worlds pulled into the Vor are locked in a struggle with each other for survival.  Players fight as one of many races trapped in the VOR.&#10;&#10;VOR is a squad-based wargame from FASA (beloved publisher of material for the well-known Battletech, Traveller, Fading Suns, and EarthDawn games).  It has an extraordinarily innovative ruleset from which other games have since borrowed and with perhaps one of the best movement systems of any of the squad miniature games.  The system supports a unit popping around a corner (out of cover), shooting, and moving back efficiently.  This game uses a hit and wound determination model much like GW's Warhammer 40K.  The rules allow you to put together your own units and characters to represent new civilizations drawn into the Vor.  Yes, you can use all those miniatures from all those other games you own!!&#10;&#10;There are some interesting miniatures (such as the Growler race) included with the base game and you can purchase additional units (even some unreleased) from Iron Wind Metals and Ral Partha, but the game is now fan-supported as the original publisher is no longer actively releasing new supplements.&#10;&#10;",

The web is a spiral, you roll the die and move Auntie, then take turns to move one of your bugs towards the exit space. Initially, Auntie is in a good mood, if she runs into a bug or bugs, they go back to her larder. But as soon as someone escapes, she loses her temper and kills anything she catches! The game has a scoring track, and each time a bug is caught or escapes, a marker moves up, also adding a number to the die roll. So Auntie runs around the web faster and faster. Players can share some spaces, but most of the time, bump each other back and forth. Naturally, nasty bugs push others into Aunty's path to certain death!&#10; Slightly confusing when you start, this is actually a really simple game, easily as good as any D&amp;F game. The original set had wooden pawns for the bugs, but D&amp;F issued a series of neat rubber bugs, which do add to the games' style.&#10;&#10;",

The best among explorers, archeologist, and adventurers will compete to decide who's the most excellent. The veil of mystery continues to surround many treasures and legendary places: Will you be able to dig them up and prove that you are the best? &mdash;&quot;Legend Raiders Inc. - Scouting Bureau&quot;&#10;&#10;In Legend Raiders, each player represents an adventurer who wants to collect as many ancient coins (a.k.a., victory points or VPs) as possible, searching for legendary treasures and mythical places. In every round on the main board are four different missions, each composed of a discovery to be performed and two random tools (ropes, shovels, compasses and maps) supplied by the bureau. The explorer who gains the most points wins.&#10;&#10;On their turn, a player chooses between two actions:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Take a discovery and place it on the personal board together with the two randomly related tools, or&#10;    Perform one or more discoveries with the tools already on the personal board.&#10;&#10;&#10;To be discovered, each treasure requires a specific combination of tools. Places require more tools than artifacts, but will give more VPs in the following expeditions. When a player uses their favorite tool, they gain more VPs; the torch can be used as a joker by turning it off, but only if it's on!&#10;&#10;Discovering new treasures gives the player VPs based on number of ancient coins visible on the personal board, uncovered by the ongoing missions. Solving one mission at a time allows the player to have more visible ancient coins and thus to score more VPs, but having more missions on the board and solving more of them in a single turn gives the player a benefit in terms of time. Each time one or more legendary treasures are discovered, the player also gains a expedition card from the four available at the bureau; expedition cards show goals that grant VPs at the end of the game if achieved.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of each round, the player rolls the adventure die and gains the resulting benefit &mdash; or causes the torches of all players to be flipped over!&#10;&#10;The game ends when the first player has dug up six or more ancient treasures. Which strategy will you choose to apply? Will you succeed being the best explorer in the world? How many and which mythical treasures will you uncover?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The largest naval battles in history are included here &ndash; the Battle of Leyte Gulf and the Battle of the Philippine Sea.  In addition, the Battles of Cape Enga&ntilde;o, Surigao Strait, and Okinawa are covered by the game.

To &lsquo;balance&rsquo; that side in hypothetical scenarios, some projected but never completed, or sometimes built, units are available as options to the Japanese &ndash; such as the third Yamato-class battleship, all six Unryu-class carriers, the &ldquo;B64&rdquo;-type Battlecruiser (one of the two named by AP &ldquo;Sagami&rdquo;), as well as squadrons of hypothetical &ldquo;second generation&rdquo; Japanese aircraft.  It&rsquo;s a &ldquo;worst case scenario&rdquo; plan for American military staff.&#10;&#10;The Americans get some new toys, too, including the first appearance in the series of the F4U Corsair, the Iowa-class battleships (and a special guest appearance by the Montana-class), Baltimore-class heavy cruisers, Cleveland-class light cruisers, Independence-class escort carriers, Essex-class fleet carriers, and the fabulous Alaska-class battlecruisers...errr...&rdquo;large cruisers&rdquo;, that is.&#10;The Royal Navy, Australian Navy, and New Zealand Navy all make appearances as well, driving this product up to simply ludicrous counter numbers!&#10;&#10;Leyte Gulf includes: &#10;&#10;     24&rdquo;x18&rdquo; tactical map &#10;     Three 34&rdquo;x22&rdquo; operational maps &#10;     Nearly 2,000 game pieces &#10;     24-page series rule book &#10;     24-page scenario book &#10;     2-player aid cards &#10;     6-organizational cards&#10;&#10;&#10;",
