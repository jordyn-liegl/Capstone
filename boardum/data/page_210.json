    "description": "Winner of both the Judges' and People's Choice awards for 'Best Abstract Game' at the UK Games Expo 2018, and of Imagination Gaming's 'Family Gold Award'.&#10;&#10;In Thieves, two players compete to steal a hoard of gold from the heart of a dragon&rsquo;s lair. Through a labyrinth, with doorways that open and close with every roll of a pair of dice, they direct the moves and actions of their gangs of thieves. Players have three goals: to take the treasure, to keep it, and to escape with it.&#10;&#10;Throughout the game its dice deliver sudden reversals of fortune, challenging players&rsquo;strategic skills by compelling them to keep adapting their plans. Every game played will be different and, whilst luck may affect the outcome of individual games, superior use of strategy will determine the winner of a series.&#10;&#10;The rules only take a few minutes to learn. Games typically take 30 minutes, although fortune with the dice, the skill of the players, and the speed of play can result in shorter or longer times.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

They also roll a randomizer die which tells them how many re-rolls they are allowed.  Once they're finished, they construct a hand (e.g. flush: 1-2-5-9-K) and mark one of the 16 tracking cells on the board with their color pegs.  They may also usurp someone else's claimed cell if their poker hand is of higher rank (hence the need to meticulously mark exact hands with the pegs).&#10;&#10;Once someone claims four cells in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal), they win. If a player cannot peg into a new cell because they can't beat a hand on the board, that player is eliminated.&#10;&#10;Games Magazine's Best New Family Game for 1994&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Jagdfieber (&quot;Hunting Fever&quot;) is a light-hearted card game in which you need to play your cards cleverly in order to capture precious prey. But beware! Your fellow hunters may be tempted to steal from you, ending the hunt sooner than you might expect. At the end of the day, captured cards score points for you, but hunters who are caught during the closed season and cards that remain in your hand will reduce your score.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with a hand of one hunter, two wolves, three rabbits, three carrots and one closed season/carrot. On a turn, each player secretly chooses a card from his hand, then they reveal the cards simultaneously. If someone played a &quot;closed season&quot; card, than all hunters played are placed in the prey pile of those players. If not, hunters each capture a wolf (starting with the &quot;Hunt starts here&quot; card and going clockwise), place that card in their prey pile, then return their hunter to their hand; any hunter that can't capture a wolf is placed under its owner's hunting lodge (a play area in front of each player).&#10;&#10;If any wolves remain, they each capture a rabbit (again starting with the &quot;Hunt starts here&quot; card and going clockwise) and are then placed in the &quot;easy prey&quot; section of that player's hunting lodge; if a wolf doesn't catch a rabbit, return it to its owner's hand. Rabbits are handled the same as wolves, but they hunt carrots (and not themselves!), moving to &quot;easy prey&quot; if they eat and returning to their owner's hand otherwise. Cards in a player's &quot;easy prey&quot; section are captured before a similar card played by that same player during the current turn; if a card is not captured while in the &quot;easy prey&quot; section, it's moved to that player's prey pile at the end of the next turn.&#10;&#10;If everyone still has at least one card in hand, move the &quot;Hunt starts here&quot; card one space clockwise and play another turn. If at least one player has no cards in hand, each player scores their prey pile, with hunters worth -4 points and all other cards worth 1-4 points. Players then reclaim their cards and play another round. After four complete rounds, the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Step-by-step strategy for two players&#10;There are four armies inside the box, the armies of the North, West, East, and South. There are 17 units in each army, but the armies have a different balance of strength. This affects the tactics and allows you to have a new experience every time you play.&#10;&#10;Each unit card has a picture of a warrior, which can be either on foot or horse. There are also numbers of the attack strength and counter-attack strength. Players will compare these two to decide the outcome of a fight.&#10;&#10;Players put out a battle field that consists of 3 columns and 4 rows. Now everything is ready for battle.&#10;&#10;How to play?&#10;The first player takes the top card from his army reserve and he leads it out onto the battlefield into one of the three cells of the first row. The unit is marching out of camp and joining battle. The unit comes out of camp and activates the unit in front. It displaces one of its comrades, that unit is activated and so on, until a unit comes into contact with the enemy. If a unit moves into an enemy cell, then the units start combat.&#10;&#10;For this we compare the attack strength of the attacker with the counterattack strength of the defender. The unit with the larger number is the winner of the round. The losing unit leaves the battlefield and is put into the discard pile, where it will remain until the end of the game, it cannot enter the battlefield again.&#10;&#10;Then it is opponent's move. He goes through the same steps. He draws the top card of his army reserve and decides on the cell it will occupy.&#10;&#10;Who wins?&#10;1. If we lead all of our units out onto the battlefield and there are no more reserve cards available, then the game is over. The winner is determined by the number of units still remaining on the field. The player with the most units wins.&#10;2. If a unit manages to cross the edge of the battlefield on the enemy side, we call this a break into the enemy camp and the game stops immediately, and the player who managed to break through wins immediately&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

More importantly, however, you must offer sacrifices to the Gods to gain their favor as they help your team toward victory.&#10;&#10;GAME PLAY&#10;&#10;The game consists of a cycle of &quot;Race Legs&quot; wherein players play Chariot, Rider, and Horse cards in an effort to win Victory Spaces on the race track.  In addition to these cards, there are also God Cards that provide special powers. Because players use up their cards (&quot;resources&quot;) to race, in each cycle there is an opportunity to acquire more resources by making sacrifices to the gods. The more you sacrifice, the better resources you receive. However, your sacrifice power is limited, so you must be careful to use it wisely.  Each cycle sets specific &quot;Racing Conditions&quot; that change from cycle to cycle, allowing for different strategies as the game progresses. The game contains a strong auction element, a fair amount of guesswork concerning what the other players will do, and a little bit of luck.&#10;&#10;COMPONENTS&#10;&#10;83 Playing Cards&#10;&#10;1 Game Board&#10;&#10;15 Tokens&#10;&#10;1 Die&#10;&#10;1 Instruction Booklet&#10;&#10;",

The game also provides brief tools to design many scenarios of your own.  In fact you could say that it is this that the game does most best.

The 19x19 board is colored in two distinct areas, the central lozenge (just reaching the edges) being called the arena. The squares are sprinkled with numbers, of values increasing near the outer corners. The players have sets of 18 (for the two-player game) clear and smoked plastic of tangram shapes, some of which have a 2 or 3 over a certain square.&#10;&#10;Starting in the center, the players lay their pieces so as to score, adjacent to an existing piece. A piece normally scores the numbers it covers; if it has a number of its own and that number falls directly over a scoring square, they are multiplied. You can sacrifice a piece by playing it upside down; it scores half (rounding down) and the opponent isn't allowed to play a piece adjacent to the sacrificed piece on his next turn --this is a neat trick when approaching a high-scoring area. You cannot sacrifice on the first turn. You cannot play outside the arena until you've accumulated at least 75 in score.&#10;&#10;Score is kept with the help of tracking pieces on the outside edges of the game board.&#10;&#10;The playing tiles come in six different shapes, each with their own name:&#10;&#10;The Eye (covers 1 square);&#10;    The Rod (covers 2 squares);&#10;    The Quoin or Corner(covers 3 squares);&#10;    The Snake (covers 4 squares);&#10;    The Door (covers 5 squares);&#10;    The Gun (covers 6 squares).&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Over the years a number of chess variants have been proposed for boards featuring hexagonally shaped cells (commonly called hexes). The most popular of these is Hexagonal Chess which was invented in 1936 by Wladyslaw Glinski of Poland.&#10;&#10;David Pritchard says, in the Encyclopedia of Chess Variants, that Glinski's game is played by over half-a-million people, mostly in Eastern Europe.&#10;&#10;It features a hexagonally-shaped (of course) 3-colour board. Otherwise, it differs from traditional chess in that it has 9 pawns and three bishops--one for each colour. The set-up naturally varies from that of a square board, but beyond that, much of the play is fairly similar.&#10;&#10;",

The theme, general gameplay, etc., are the same as original Falling.&#10;&#10;From the publisher's website:&#10;&quot;Everyone is falling. And fighting. The object of the game is to hit the ground last. It's not much of a goal, but it's all you could think of on the way down.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;One player deals the cards, while the other players fall. There are no turns; everyone is playing at once. Players can play cards on each other, or on themselves. These cards are called &quot;riders,&quot; and they change how the dealer will deal. A &quot;Hit&quot; means &quot;Give me two cards.&quot; A &quot;Skip&quot; means &quot;Don't give me anything.&quot; And so on. Those Skips come in really handy at the end of the deck, when the dealer starts handing out the Ground cards. Catch a Ground card, and you're dead.&quot;&#10;&#10;Falling is a real-time game, it takes as long to play as it takes to deal a deck of cards at a leisurely pace.

Sometimes you&rsquo;re lucky and get a large hand of cards you can choose from, and sometimes you have to micromanage and get the best out of a small hand. It&rsquo;s a game where your luck can change suddenly when the Sandman lashes out, testing your intuition and skills. Will you hide and wait for the attack to blow over, or will you actively attack and escape by the skin of your teeth?&#10;&#10;In Sleep Tight you need to constantly be alert and think few steps ahead, as you will need to guess the other players&rsquo; next move or even worse, the Sandman&rsquo;s!&#10;&#10;The players uses action cards and Soul Fragments as a &quot;fuel&quot; for their action. They choose to cooperate with other players or can even join the Sandman in his evil goals.&#10;&#10;The Sandman has a stack of action cards that represents also his health pool. When the Sandman is out of action he is defeated. There are a lot of ways to inflict faster damages to him.&#10;&#10;There are two ways to win:&#10;&#10;     Kill the Sandman. If the Sandman deck is empty, all the players win. If you prefer to have one winner in this case, the winner is the player with most Soul Fragments. (The nightmare ends, and everyone wakes up.)&#10;     Escape the nightmare. If a player has 10 Soul Fragments and plays the card, that player wins and the other players lose. (The dream collapses, leaving the other players to be consumed by the Sandman.)&#10;&#10;&#10;There are two ways to lose:&#10;&#10;     Everyone dies. If every player dies by reaching 0 Soul Fragments, the players lose. (They die and are completely consumed by the Sandman.)&#10;     The nightmare traps you.

Collect 3 sets of dim sums cards and 1 pair of tea cards!&#10;&#10;10 cards are dealt to each player. All remaining cards are placed in a deck faced down. Players take turns drawing a card from either the deck or any card from the centre. The player then decides which card they want to keep and end their turn by discarding a card into the centre face-up.&#10;&#10;Play strategically and collect small, medium, big and dessert dim sums to wrap up the game quickly, or go for glory and collect the super, special and top dim sums to score as many points as possible. You are in control of your own fortune.&#10;&#10;A round of Yum Cha ends when a player draws the eleventh card which makes a complete hand, revealing 3 sets of dim sums and 1 pair of tea. When they do so, they announce Yum Cha! and the round ends. A set of dim sums consists of three unique dim sums from the same tier. Duplicate dim sums cannot form a part of a set. A pair of tea consists of two tea cards of the same flavour.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

(This wolf closest to him must be a legal move.) If a player can't move, he loses his turn and the other player can move any wolf of his choosing.&#10;&#10;The first player to place four wolves in a column wins!&#10;&#10;",

You could spend the rest of the day helping those miserable, wretched wastes of human skin who come in and demand service, or you could do what you always wanted - tell them were to go and have a good time. And you know which one it&rsquo;s going to be...&#10;&#10;From the instructions.&#10;&#10;In Severance each player assumes the role of one the characters at the store. They can steal items from the store, slack off, or keep performing their work duties. Each activity has risks and rewards. The player scores points after successfully slacking off and after taking their stolen goods to their locker. When a player gets caught (by the boss) doing something wrong they gain heat. Heat also naturally rises during the game. When a player reaches 30 they are fired. The game ends when all of the players but one are fired or the event deck is exhausted.&#10;&#10;Five Fingered Severance is a take that game. To gain points the players will have to open themselves up to the other player's attacks. I want the game to be more tactical though, so the plot cards in the deck are limited to just a few types of cards. This allows players to know about what they are getting when they take a turn to refresh their hand.&#10;&#10;",

In the game of Kamozza, you are exporters and your goal is to load as much of your freight as possible into ships.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, each player has the same set of freight cards of various loads.&#10;&#10;There are two docks on the table. Each round, two ships come into these docks. The one of these two ships has larger load capacity, and the other has smaller. Then each player secretly chooses a freight card from their hand and destination ship to load the freight. When they are revealed, count up the load for each ship. If the load exceeds the ship's capacity, the ship is sunk. Otherwise freight is successfully loaded and victory points are scored to the successful players.&#10;&#10;After the fifth round, the highest scorer wins the game.&#10;&#10;This game is simple but exciting, and its artwork is cute.

    "description": "A mancala game.&#10;&#10;From Mancala World:&#10;http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Mangala_II&#10;&#10;&quot;Mangala is a Turkish mancala game which was very popular in the 17th and 18th century. According to Metin And, a Turkish ethnologue, the game could be related to the &quot;mancala&quot; of The Arabian Nights (fifteenth night), one of the first literary accounts of mancala games. The game was depicted in Turkish paintings as early as in the 16th century. In Europe, it was first mentioned in 1694 by the English traveller Thomas Hyde. Mangala was also found by Edward Daniel Clarke in Balaklava, Crimea (now a suburb of Sevastopol) in 1801 and by Peter Emund Laurent on Chios Island (now Greece) in 1818. It might have influenced Mandoli (Hydra Island, Greece) and Ban-Ban (Bosnia). Mangala has almost the same rules as the Baltic German Bohnenspiel, which originated in Persia where it was known as Manqala or Manqalat.&#10;Two Ottoman Women playing Mangala (18th century)&#10;&#10;The classic Mangala is still known in Turkey. However, the Mangala played in Gaziantep in Southeast Anatolia is not related to it at all, but is a close variant of La'b madjnuni (&quot;The Crazy Game&quot;), which was played in Damascus (Syria) in the late 19th century. More games called &quot;Mangala&quot; (again with quite different rules) are popular among the Bedouins in Egypt.&#10;&#10;Mangala might be the first commercialized mancala game in a western country. A game called &quot;mangola&quot; (a common synonym for the Turkish Mangala at this time) was published by Jaques in England in 1863, after Walter Whitmore Jones claimed to have invented it. Jaques pattern book covering shows a thick wood board with two rows of six cells in which something like white beans are placed. The records of copyrights kept by the Stationers company, the Public Records Office at Kew, includes a volume covering 1862-64, which has an entry showing that the rules of Mangola were protected by copyright at that time. Richard Ballam, a board games collector, found an advertisement in the Illustrated London News (December 23, 1865) saying: &quot;Mangola, a new game. By the author of Squails, Frogs &amp; Toads etc. Wholesale Jaques &amp; Son&quot;. Claiming foreign or nearly forgotten boardgames as own designs happens frequently in the game industry. (...)&#10;&#10;Rules&#10;&#10;Mangala is played on a board, which consists of 12 holes dug into the earth. Initially there are six glass beads (&quot;boncu&#196;&#159;u&quot;) or cowrie shells in each hole.&#10;&#10;On his turn a player distributes the contents of a hole, one by one, in a counter-clockwise direction into the succeeding holes.&#10;&#10;If the last bead falls in a hole on either side of the board, making a total of two, four or six beads including the last bead, its contents are captured.&#10;&#10;If this hole is preceded by other holes which contain two, four or six beads, their contents are also taken.&#10;&#10;A player must move if he can, but passes when his holes are empty.&#10;&#10;The game is finished when all holes are empty.&#10;&#10;The player who captured more beads wins the game.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

But they still haunt the house.  You must try to find out who was murdered, by what means and why.&#10;&#10;The cards include Motive cards, No Clue cards and a single &quot;It's a Mystery to Me&quot; card.  In addition, there are cards that can be assembled side by side to form larger pictures: the six guests (Cleopatra, Napoleon, etc. --they were costumed, you see; in four pieces), four weapons (also in four pieces) and Alfred Hitchcock (in six pieces).  Seven cards are dealt to each player, the rest into the house's rooms.  You enter a room by exact count, except that a 7, 11 or doubles allows you to go directly to the spot of your choice.  When you reach a room, you pick up the top card there and discard either it or another card from your hand to the &quot;Lawn&quot; --off the board.  These cards are laid face down without overlapping each other but are shown to the other players as they're laid down.  Later, you may try to recover a Lawn card by showing a card from your hand of the appropriate type (a piece of a guest, for example) and then pointing to a Lawn card and picking it up.  If you remembered right, you may repeat the procedure.  You can also claim cards from other players by meeting them in the house and &quot;accusing them&quot; of withholding a particular card (this is what the No Clue cards are defence for).  Once the rooms are empty, everyone gathers in the hall and play is speeded up.&#10;&#10;First player to assemble a Ghost, Weapon and Motive OR Alfred and &quot;It's a Mystery to Me&quot; wins.&#10;&#10;",

Unfortunately, the school is also a training ground for dark beings from the 5th dimension. These beings, while capable of unfathomable universe destroying power, have a long way to go in order to reach their full potential. The MSfB will help them reach that potential!&#10;&#10;In a twist on the Miskatonic genre of games, instead of players taking on the roles of humans trying withstand the dark forces around you, players instead play the dark forces of the Lovecraft universe (or at least &ldquo;dark forces in training&rdquo;). The game takes place during the final 3-day test in the &ldquo;Human Possession&rdquo; course. Each 5th dimensional horror starts the test in control of one of the human students of the school. The goal for the beast is to figure out which student they are in possession of before the other members of the class figure out which student they are controlling.&#10;&#10;Designed by Garrett Herdter, MSfB takes the standard deduction game concept of &ldquo;I try to guess the other players hidden roles&rdquo; and flips it. In MSfB, each player has no idea who they are, but they DO know who all the other people are. This dynamic and the fact that 1 or 2 of the players can lie during the game make MSfB hysterical fun while still being easily accessible and quick to learn.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "(from the introduction:)&#10;&#10;The Moscow Option: Guderian's Gambit is a simulation of the fighting that could have taken place between Smolensk and Moscow during the first half of August 1941 if Hitler had decided to concentrate his eastern armies' supply in order to allow the mechanized forces of Army Group Center to make the 150 miles to the Soviet capital city. Historically, of course, the German dictator chose instead to halt the AGC, temporarily de-emphasizing Moscow as a target while diverting his forces' strength on the front's northern and southern sectors. Here we assume he chose instead to reorganize the mobile divisions of Panzer Groups 2 and 3 and ad hoc Panzer Army Guderian, putting that general in charge of a daring effort to take Moscow, thereby winning the war by plunging the entire Soviet Union into strategic paralysis.&#10;&#10;This is a two-player, operational-level, alternative history wargame of low complexity. In it, the German player controls all Panzer Army Guderian units and is opposed by the Soviet player who controls all the Red Army units.&#10;&#10;The situation is inescapably such that the German player controls the strategic initiative and sets the overall tempo of play. We therefore recommend opponents who share a particularly competitive relationship should play a series of matches, switching sides each time, before deciding who between them owns bragging rights to the game.&#10;&#10;1 hex : 9 miles&#10;GT : 1 day&#10;Units : divisions and brigades (3000-12000 men and/or about 50 to 180 armored vehicles)&#10;&#10;",

Land battles, naval operations and special forces are included, but serve mainly as a background of the air war.&#10;&#10;The Polish player manages his squadrons and sends them against enemy troop concentrations with bombers and ground-attack aircraft, engages the enemy aicraft with his fighters, and decides about the use of his air-defence assets... hoping for the timely arrival of NATO squadrons coming to his aid.&#10;&#10;The &quot;Agresor&quot; commands ground forces, supports them with his aircraft squadrons and tries to destroy the Polish airforce, or at least take out its airbases.&#10;&#10;The idea behind Eagles and Missiles is based on scenarios being considered by the Polish staff and tested on big field war games such as: Anakonda and Dragon. Like in the real-world simulations the invasion is performed from three directions: the Baltic (naval invasion), Kaliningrad District and Belorussia.

    "description": "(from MMP website:)&#10;&#10;In July, 1763, Fort Pitt (now Pittsburgh) was under siege as part of Pontiac&rsquo;s Rebellion. A relief column was sent out from Carlisle in order to try and break the siege. The column was under the command of Colonel Henry Bouquet and consisted of approximately 500 British soldiers of the 42nd Highlanders, 77th Highlanders, and 60th Royal Americans.&#10;&#10;On August 5th, several hundred Indian warriors of the Delaware, Shawnee, Mingo, and Huron tribes attacked the column east of Bushy Run Station. The British held out, and that night a redoubt was constructed from the supplies, and the wounded were treated inside this perimeter. The next day, the Indians attacked again, and a British counterattack broke the Indians. The British column was able to advance, and relieve Fort Pitt on August 10th.&#10;&#10;The Battle of Bushy Run game uses a simplified version of Iwo Jima: Rage Against the Marines (in Operations Special Magazine Issue #1). The American Indian units use a concealed map and have dummy units to help hide their movement. The British force is a mix of soldiers, grenadiers, and scouts (who can reveal hidden Indian units). To increase replayability there are random events each turn (8 turns, 10 event chits, so 2 are not played each game...their identify is not revealed). Both sides have multiple ways in which they can secure victory.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Welcome to Banana Republic, a political unstable country where the economy is controlled by political and business elites. You are one of the elite of this nation, and your objective is to stash enough money in an offshore trust fund that you can retire comfortably. Invest your income in stocks, properties and bonds, then exert influence on the government to manipulate the economy for your personal gain. Orchestrate the downfall of other elites by destroying their personal life through car accidents, expensive divorces, and shotgun babies. Do you have what it takes to survive in this cutthroat world of money mania?&#10;&#10;Wongamania: Banana Economy is an economic and modern finance board game that reflects the complexity of modern investment portfolio management by incorporating multiple asset classes that behave differently under different economic situations. Deviating from the traditional auction mechanisms used by most stock-trading board games, Wongamania: Banana Economy uses a combination of resource management, environment manipulation, and take-that mechanisms to reflect the brutal competition and uncertainty of the modern global financial markets. Players have to manage a portfolio of stocks, properties and bonds, and assess the risk-reward of holding them in different allocations. Players are also able to influence the economic environment by manipulating it to either benefit their personal investment allocation or to wreck havoc against other players who are using a different asset allocation strategy. Players are also able to make use of their money for other purposes, such as sabotaging the personal lives of other players, hiring professionals to disrupt the strategy of other players and buying insurance to protect against sabotages. Whoever stashes enough money in a off-shore trust fund wins the game.&#10;&#10;Wongamania: Banana Economy is a reimplementation of the 2014 game Wongamania (only available in SEA), and multiple changes have been made to cater better to the international audience.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "You are in the enchanted forest, and you must leave before night. The magic tree stands in the middle of the forest. It is a multi-colored tree that you may grow or shrink, and you must overcome its challenge to escape. Specifically, you have to insert all your wooden pieces in the tree trunk and capture a precise number of your opponents' trunk pieces. Be smart and skilled, and you will succeed. Otherwise, you will turn into a mushroom and spend one thousand years near the tree with all the ones who missed before you!&#10;&#10;All players start Arbra Kadabra with ten wooden trunk pieces in your color, with the die (showing 1/1/2/2/3/3) and the base of the tree in the center of the table. On a turn, you roll the die, then either add a number of pieces to the tree or remove a number of pieces to the tree equal to the number that you rolled. (If the tree is too short to take pieces, then you must add them.)&#10;&#10;When you add pieces to the tree, you must add pieces of your own color first. Once you have no more pieces of your color, you can instead place pieces of other players' colors. Why would you have pieces of their color? Two reasons: (1) When you remove pieces from the tree, you must take them from the top down; you can't remove pieces from the center of the tree. (2) If the tree collapses on your turn, then you must take all of the pieces that fell and add them to your collection.&#10;&#10;What are you trying to do with all this building and unbuilding? To win the game, you must have none of your own pieces in front of you. In addition, you must have exactly four of the opponent's pieces in a two-player game, exactly three of each opponent's pieces in a three-player game, or exactly two of each opponent's pieces in a four-player game.

    "description": "The Bridge to Treasure Cave', first released as Die Br&uuml;cke am Rio D'Oro, is old and brittle &ndash; no, not the game itself, but the bridge that spans the river, the bridge that connects explorers to the treasure cave on the other side of the gorge.&#10;&#10;But who will be first to cross this dangerous path? Players must exercise the highest level of caution because a rotten plank of wood in the bridge might break at any time, causing the player &ndash; or worse, some of the precious treasure &ndash; to plunge into the gorge. What's more, the other treasure hunters will be only too glad to pilfer your finds should you give them the chance.&#10;&#10;The goal in The Bridge to Treasure Cave is to cross the bridge (a 3D structure inside the box), grab the treasure and cross the bridge again to return the treasure to your camp. On your turn, you roll a number of dice to determine how far you move. Each die face shows how far you must move and possibly some event:&#10;&#10;     Danger, which adds another die roll which may cause the bridge to (partly) collapse at your location, or may cause you to lose a treasure;&#10;     Repair, which allows you to repair a damaged part of the bridge;&#10;     Pilfer, which allows you to steal a treasure from another player, if you land on his location.&#10;&#10;&#10;There are three dice: a green die, which in general permits only slow, but safe movement, a yellow die, which gives a good chance to pilfer treasure, and a red die, which allows for fast, but risky movement. The number of treasures you are carrying determines how many dice you may roll: the more treasures you carry, the fewer dice you roll. After rolling, you select one die to execute.&#10;&#10;If you reach the treasure cave, you can immediately claim up to three treasures. If you reach your camp, you may unload your treasures and prepare for the next crossing. If you end your move at a gap in the bridge, or if the bridge collapses under you, any treasures you are carrying are lost in the river, and you return to your base camp.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, the cave holds 25 treasures. The first player to carry a certain number of treasures (depending on the number of players) back to his camp wins. Alternatively, if no player has acquired that number of treasures before all treasures have been claimed or lost in the river, the player who has collected the most treasures wins.&#10;&#10;",

The heart of the game is an electronic buzzer device that records who will answer the question first.  Up to 6 players have this buzzer pad in front of them and the first one who hits the button gets to answer.  However, you can lose points for incorrect answers so before you hit the button you'd better know the answer.  The game comes with a book of trivia questions divided into Champion, Master, and Wizard levels of play.  Rules for nine variations of the 3 levels are included in the rules. Quizzard has three game setting labeled Fast Hands, Strategy (machine selects who will answer) and Countdown.  Quizzard runs on 4 AA batteries and has a built-in score track.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "From Publisher Website:&#10;&#10;Pathagon is an exciting, ever changing new strategy game of building paths. While Pathagon is quick and easy to learn, there is a depth of strategy that will keep you on your toes. Players take turns placing their wooden game pieces on the board in an attempt to build a path from one side of the game board to the other. There is a &quot;trapping&quot; move that allows a player to &quot;trap&quot; and remove one of their opponents game pieces from the board. The first player to complete the path wins. Sounds simple, doesn't it? The catch is that the two paths cross. Every move has an offensive and defensive consideration. Pathagon is simple enough to be played by children, strategic enough to engage a true gamer. The rules have been drafted so that there is always a winner, no ties, stalemates, or cat's games. Hand crafted from high quality hardwoods, Pathagon is pretty enough to be left out on the coffee table or bookshelf to be played again and again.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Destruction of Army Group Center: The Soviet Summer Offensive, 1944, is a simulation on a corps/division level of the Russian Summer Offensive of 1944 on the Eastern Front (Operation Bagration). Historically this offensive destroyed one entire Nazi Army Group, and prevented large transfers of men and equipment to the newly formed Western Front where the Anglo-American forces were expanding their beachhead in preparation for the August Breakout. The game covers the first twenty days of the offensive, during which all the decisive action took place. There are several scenarios, depicting a variety of likely possibilities, from the historical one through various degrees of German preparedness and 'sanity'.&quot;&#10;&#10;Units represent Russian corps and Axis divisions. Stacking limit is 3 units/hex. Players alternate moves. Order of phases in each movement turn is: movement phase, combat phase, second mechanized movement phase. Semi-active zones of control extend into adjacent hexes, with some exceptions. Units pay two extra movement points to enter or leave an enemy zone of control, and may move directly from one controlled hex to another if they have enough movement points. Attacking is voluntary. Combat results involve unit eliminations, exchanges, and retreats, but the Axis mechanized units have a modified step-reduction mechanism (an eliminated Axis mechanized unit is replaced by a weak battlegroup which has no zone of control, and is worth extra victory points to the Russian player if it's eliminated in a later combat).&#10;&#10;Victory is determined by victory points, gained by eliminating enemy units and, for the German player, for failure by the Russian player to have a continuous line from the north to the south board edge at the end of his turn.&#10;&#10;Four scenarios are provided, ranging from the historical one where Hitler's propensity for issuing &quot;Stand Fast&quot; orders finally caught up with the Axis, to the maximum withdrawal scenario, in which the Axis essentially eliminates the portion of the front historically covered by Army Group North and uses the forces of that Army Group to strengthen the resulting greatly-shortened line in the Army Group Center area.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 2 days&#10;Hex: 10 miles / 16 km&#10;Units: Kampfgruppe to Corps&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 22 x 28&quot; map&#10;One single-side printed countersheet (200 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One foldout rules folder (folds out to 10 pages)&#10;&#10;",
