Additionally, the contestants are allowed to use anything as weapons against one another, with a fat cash prize encouraging such motivation for the contestants.&#10;&#10;In Space Junk, you've landed a spot on this reality television show, and now it's time to clean up outer space while entertaining the masses! Orbit the earth seeking out and picking up space junk, both to build a ship with and to recycle! The game is simple, easy to learn and will reduce you to tears (of laughter) as you build the most ridiculous ship imaginable.&#10;&#10;You will use your ship to speed around the earth, crash into and attack other players, and collect valuable junk to become the most famous contestant! Space Junk plays 2-6 players and plays different every time with the huge variety of cards.&#10;&#10;",

And those who really start sinking can make a comeback using the large Mr. Monopoly token that gives players advantages over everyone else. So get playing, get the revenge you've been craving, and feel good about losing!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Starting with Black, players take turns placing and swapping stones on the intersecting points of a square grid (with side lengths of either 5, 9, 13, or 19) which is initially empty. Passing is forbidden. Same-colored stones with orthogonal adjacency are connected. The game is over when a player wins by connecting their designated sides of the board with a single group of connected stones of their color, at any time during their turn or their opponent's turn. Cutting stones are four stones in the following generic crosscut configuration:&#10;&#10;OX&#10;XO&#10;&#10;On your turn, place a stone of your color on an empty point, if possible. If that created a crosscut, swap the placed stone with different adjacent enemy stones that share a crosscut with it, until that stone is no longer part of a crosscut. If you haven't placed a stone this turn, then instead choose a friendly stone in a crosscut and resolve as above.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

You, on the other hand, are more interested in old shipwrecks &mdash; more specifically, sunken Spanish galleons filled with gold. Time to embark on an old-fashioned underwater treasure hunt. What you didn't anticipate is that several of you have discovered the legends of these buried riches. To make matters worse, a barracuda is prowling through the shipwrecks.&#10;&#10;The challenge in Barrakuda is to be the first player to have eight gold pieces in their vault, but before you can lock away gold in your vault, you need to find it on shipwrecks or steal it from others.&#10;&#10;To set up the game, lay out shipwreck cards numbered 1-6 in some orthogonal arrangement, and give each player movement cards numbered 1-5, along with a barracuda card. On a turn, each player chooses a card from their hand, then they reveal them simultaneously. If you played a movement card, move your pawn to that shipwreck card; if you're the only player there (and the barracuda isn't), take both the special action and general action listed on the card. If more than one player is on the same shipwreck card, then whoever has the fewest movement cards in front of them has the initiative and can either take the special action or take all the gold from one player's bag; after this, all players take this card's general action.&#10;&#10;If you're the only one who played a barracuda card, roll the distance die, then move it up to that many spaces in the direction of your choice. If a barracuda is on the same space as a player, they have to drop their gold on that shipwreck space; others can pick up that gold starting next turn. If none or more than one player play barracuda, roll the direction and distance card to determine where it goes.&#10;&#10;Actions on cards let you pick up gold, move gold from your bag to your vault, protect you from the barracuda, take back movement cards, move the barracuda, and so on.&#10;&#10;",

You do not have to purchase boxes of cards to play.  You buy a character pack and a story pack then find someone else who has done the same and play.&#10;&#10;In the character pack you will get a character who stands up and all the cards you need to make him unique.  Each character has stats for might, resolve, savvy and combat.  You can add 5 points to spend upgrading your character.  You upgrade with 5 types of cards called merits with varying costs.  Abilities generally boost one of your 4 attributes.  Advantages are special skills available to the character. Allies are friends that travel with you and add their skills to help you.  Arts are magic abilities that help you in various ways.  Treasures are items that you can carry to help you or you can find them in your journeys.  If you want to add more then 5 points to your character you can add flaws which are worth negative points.  If you add 2 points of flaws then you would have seven points of merits you could add.  These come in three flavors.  Curses represent special liabilities of your character.  Enemies represent individuals or races with great hatred for you which if met fight with an advantage.  Weakness usually affect your stats.  Once you have created your character you can go on an adventure.&#10;&#10;In your story pack you will find leagues which are put together to create a map. Each league has a terrain type or types, cost to enter or leave, special affects and what attribute you may recover if resting there.  In your story pack you will also find quest cards.  The quest card tells you what you are trying to achieve.  Each quest has four attributes.  These are Experience points received when the quest is achieved, Total points of waylays allowed against the quest, total points in treasures that can be seeded and the victory conditions required to complete the quest.  You will also find waylay cards in your story pack.  These will have indicators on them to tell you in what terrain you are allowed to play them in.  There is a point rating that is applied against the quests waylay rating.  Each waylay also has a test that must be passed.  Failing a waylay can have dire consequences or it may just delay you by one turn.&#10;&#10;It is a very simple game that never plays the same way twice as long as you have a few boosters around to mix things up.&#10;&#10;",

Crayons are used to draw narrow- and standard-gage track on the hex map. Income is acquired by contracting mines and by first entry into cities.  Interaction is provided in the form of lawyers, whose injunctions can stop opponents from blasting their way through difficult mountain passes.&#10;&#10;Advanced Tracks to Telluride (1995) is a ziplock bagged expansion game kit by John Bohrer, the resulting game lasting 6 hours.&#10;&#10;Colorado Rails is the cheaper tube version of Tracks to Telluride.

While Warriors can move in any direction (like the Queen in Chess), Sabers may only move cardinally (as rooks) and Tridents may only move diagonally (as bishops).  Defenders, as the name implies, cannot capture but are used to block or confound one's opponent.  Pieces are captured in a Checkers-like fashion of being jumped over, with special rules for corner captures, and piece substitution.  An unusual game combining very well-known mechanics from two of the classics.&#10;&#10;",

Players are big investors (and I mean big - the smallest notes are $50 million and billions of dollars change hands) and wheeler-dealers.&#10;&#10;Players acquire shares in companies, primarily randomly (picked up as cards), but also possibly through purchase of other players' previous sales. To form the companies they must also acquire resources, which are bought from 4 sets. The pricing mechanism for these is like Palmyra and McMulti - each purchase increases the price and each sale decreases it. Once an appropriate set is acquired for a matching set of (at least two) shares in a company, the company can be formed. Companies pay income to their owners each turn. They can also be sold off at a premium, or split up (provided the owner has enough shares and resources) to gain double income. The real heart of the game comes in the option to conduct hostile takeovers. A player lays one or more shares in a company owned by another player and then starts a bidding war to takeover the company. Each player is bidding to buy the shares of the opponent (bids are per share). The &quot;winner&quot; gets the company and all the shares, the &quot;loser&quot; is paid off at the final bid price. Who is actually the winner and loser depends, of course, on the balance of the final price.&#10;&#10;There is a sudden death variable finish, when assets plummet in value, so there is a tense few final rounds when players can try to realize assets while they are still valuable. During this period the judgment of takeover prices becomes even more tricky (and a gamble).&#10;&#10;",

The &quot;mortal powers&quot; of Armenia automatically pursue the magicians whose major defense is their ability to conjure fearsome demons.&#10;&#10;(paraphrased from the Historical Notes section of the instruction manual)&#10;&#10;The basic story of the key of Solomon holds that when Solomon was building the first temple in Jerusalem, one of his workers was seized by an evil spirit.  The archangel Michael appeared and delivered to Solomon a magical ring which gave him the power to command all spirits.  Solomon commanded the spirits into a brass vessel, which he sealed and cast into a lake in Babylonia.  Solomon had foreseen the possibility of the demons being released again and had prepared a testament detailing the various rituals and instruments that could be prepared by any person to command the spirits once more.  This power was to have been used for curing disease and preventing harm, but when printed examples appeared again in the 17th century the emphasis had switched to the finding of treasure and personal gain by the magician instead.&#10;&#10;",

The juxtaposition of incongruous concepts, the odd but perfectly understandable expressions for familiar concepts that often result on at least one side of the anagram, and the deadpan stock photography illustrations are all played for absurd humour.&#10;&#10;This sort of memory based on playing with words is more difficult than the usual one.

    "description": "Cubilete is an old and very traditional game in Cuba that is second in popularity only to Cuban dominoes. Similar cubilete games are played in other Latin American countries, but the rules vary all over the map, with many cultures playing a version that is very much like the card game Poker/Poker Dice. The Cuban game however is unique!&#10;&#10;There are five Dice in the traditional Cubilete set. Each dice has six sides, and each side has one of the following characters on it: Ace, King, Queen (also known as &quot;Cundangas&quot;), Jack (Jevas, or Mujeres), 10 (Los Gallegos), 9 (Los Negros).&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to roll five dice of the same kind. A hand with less than five of a kind has absolutely no value.&#10;&#10;To win a round, you need to get the highest hand. The winner of each round (and only the winner) wins points based on the value of their hand. A game is played to a total score of 10 patas (points). Whoever gets 10 points first wins the game, even if all of the players have not had a turn.&#10;&#10;The ultimate goal of the game is to score &quot;Carabinas.&quot; If you roll any Carabina during the game you immediately win the round and get to keep rolling for another round.&#10;&#10;There are three types of Carabina, listed in order of value.&#10;&#10;Carabina de Aces -- is worth ten points and is very difficult to obtain. To get Carabina de Aces, you need to get a complete set of five aces within the three-roll limit. If you get Carabina de Aces, you are awarded 10 points. The game is over. You have eliminated everyone else in the game. You are the winner of the game, even if no one else had a chance to roll! If you get Carabina de Aces, then you are always the first roller in the next game.&#10;&#10;Carabina de Ks (Kings) Naturales -- you need to have five Kings within your three allotted rolls. If you get this type of Carabina, you get five points. You win the round, the round ends and you keep on rolling on to the next round.&#10;&#10;Carabina de Ks (Kings) No Naturales -- the only way to obtain this is by pairing the Aces with the Kings. (The Ace can be paired with any of the other dice because it is wild.) If you obtain this type of carabina, you get two points. You win the round, the round ends and you keep on rolling on to the next round.&#10;&#10;If nobody gets a Carabina after everyone has had their turn, one point is awarded to the person with the highest hand:&#10;&#10;&middot; Five Queens&#10;&middot; Five Jevas (Jacks)&#10;&middot; Five Gallegos&#10;&middot; Five Negros&#10;&#10;The strategy in Cubilete is knowing what to play for and when, depending on what your opponents score. Obviously, luck is the dominant factor. Cubilete is often played as a drinking game, with several scoring variations.&#10;&#10;",

Landing on the same space as another player bumps the player who was there first ahead one space. Use Trigger and Defuse cards strategically to find safer routes for yourself and move opponents faster!&#10;&#10;Red and Orange split paths may have certain advantages and disadvantages, choose wisely!&#10;&#10;Landing on a Panic Room or Retreat space for the first time sends a player to a safe haven. For the next round, that player may not play nor can they be played on. After their next turn they are sent out according to the arrow, where they will be vulnerable to play. If all opponents are in safe havens a remaining player MUST play a card on themself.&#10;&#10;The first player to be sent to the Anxiety Spiral loses. But they are not out of the game because misery LOVES company! The losing player may now move one space in either direction EVERY TIME a card is played. If the losing player lands on the same space as a remaining player, the remaining player is sent directly to the Anxiety Spiral and then begins to go after other players in the same fashion until there is only one active player.&#10;&#10;The last person to be sent to the Anxiety Spiral is the winner!&#10;&#10;",

Instead, players roll the color-coded die, and answers a question matching the color rolled. If a player correctly answers a question, he may &quot;go for a wedge&quot; by answering another question in the same category. If he does so, he keeps that card. If the player answers a question incorrectly, it is the next player's turn. Play ends when a player has collected six cards/correctly answered 12 questions.&#10;&#10;",

Players explore the ruins of the modern world completing quests, honing their skills and maneuvering for social status in order to claim a precious spot as a citizen with a Golden City. To enter the golden city you must:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Become an expert: Reach 20 skill points.&#10;    Serve the city: Fulfill three secret quests.&#10;    Become a nobleman: Get the most possible character points.&#10;&#10;&#10;In each turn, the players can spend action points to do several actions such as moving through the city, raiding buildings, attacking other players, and more. Each player has a specific skill &mdash; mechanic, trader, electrician, bodyguard and medic &mdash; and has his own unique items to build; those items can be traded off against other items or resources.&#10;&#10;The board of the game is modular so that in every game you have a new map to discover. All over the map, the players find different buildings which they can raid. Each time a player raids a building, a raid card of this type of building is taken and read, which leads to specific circumstances taking place. The player will be made to make various decisions including important moral decisions! Upon resolving the various decisions, you will receive character points. The choices you make, for good or for bad, will lead to specific perks and advantages (or disadvantages) during the progress of the game. When raiding a building, you get resources (tools, scraps, mechanics, electronics, etc.). By combining these resources, you can craft items with special abilities. By doing so, you will advance your skill points.&#10;&#10;Every player also gets secret quests of the golden city. To fulfill these quests, the players have to spend the resources mentioned on the card. To fulfill a quest will not only lead the players closer to victory but also give them advantages for the rest of the game.&#10;&#10;",
