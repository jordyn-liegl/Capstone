Every project assigned to you is doomed from the start, so your best bet is to dump it on someone else or try to get it killed before it eats away any more of your life. In fact, the only thing that really matters in the end is your own happiness.

Play as Cale and do your best to rescue the orphans, or play as Richard and harvest these innocent souls before the fire gets them first.&#10;&#10;Every turn is divided into two phases: the action phase and the fire phase. During the action phase, you have three actions to use and six actions from which to choose: Move your pawn; Guide an orphan; Put out a fire; Stop, drop, and roll; or your character's two special actions. During the fire phase, roll to see how many fires spread, following the immutable rules of the fire phase.&#10;&#10;Cale's player gets to use the pawn's unique orphan-hauling grip. Cale's arms are designed to hook onto the orphans' hands, allowing our elven hero to carry the orphans he saves with him.&#10;&#10;Richard uses the red fire pawns that, like the yellow fire pawns going around the orphanage, clip to the base of the pawns they set on fire.&#10;&#10;Orphans &amp; Ashes is a fast-paced two-player tile-laying game with push-your-luck and dexterity elements that plays in 45-60 minutes. The game contains over one hundred plastic pieces, including more miniature orphans than any other game on the market, guaranteed.&#10;&#10;",

The aim is to score 10,000 or more points (although with 6 or more players you can decide to play to 5,000 or 7,500 points).&#10;&#10;There are 110 cards - 14 each of 1-6, 22 Farkles and 4 score summary cards. Each player is dealt one card BUT all players can play off anyone else's cards. The rest of the deck is placed in the middle of the table and each player takes it in turn to draw one card from the deck and place it in front of themself or another player. The goal is to create combinations that score (eg three 1s = 300 points, three 6s = 600 points, six of any number = 3,000 points and so on). If you create a winning combination you can either slide it to the center of the table for potential scoring or leave it where it is to try and build a bigger score. You can stop drawing at any time and score any cards you've placed in the center. However, if at any time you draw a Farkle card you MUST stop drawing, and any cards in the center can't be scored and become part of the face-up cards in front of you. You keep your Farkle card to one side and no other players may take it but you may use it to score later. Farkle cards are scored whenever their owner makes a successful scoring combination. The first player to 10,000 points (or the agreed total) wins!&#10;&#10;The publisher places no limit on the number of players.&#10;&#10;",

Lucifer opens his Wings of darkness while the Archangel Michael protects the host of blessed pious souls. The judgment day came. The Beast devours the last chimes while the souls of men are contested by unleashing the Four knights of the Apocalypse.&#10;&#10;Apokalypsis is a biblical game for 3-6 players from the age of 13. As fallen angels, players will challenge themselves using the Knights of the Apocalypse, Events and Deadly Sins, reaping and stealing Souls before the last chime. Keep an eye on the position of Lucifer, the Beast and the Archangel Michael: like three hands of a terrifying clock, they move between light and darkness threatening the end of time. There is even the possibility that all players will lose the game, if the Archangel will be able to save more Souls, raising them to Heaven.&#10;&#10;The game is designed by Jacopo Casiraghi, Andrea Vitagliano and Gianni Negrini. In order to treat the matter in a dignified way and avoid flattening its complexity, Apokalypsis was developed after a serious and thorough historical and philological research: in the rulebook a short compendium about the events described in the Apocalypse of John.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

If the bidder can make his bid, the caller must pay him the number of chips equal to the difference between his bid and the actual count, otherwise the bidder pays the caller.  If the bidder made his bid exactly, he wins the pot.  In any case, the loser of that challenge also loses one of their dice.  A player is out of the game if he runs out of chips or dice.&#10;&#10;",

Is so appropriate to train memory, attention and creativity capacities and also communication and social skills needed in any social context.&#10;&#10;1.

Cards must be placed face down so that no one can see them.&#10;&#10;3. The player with the strangest face begins, by taking a card and placing it face up in the middle of the table, within reach of all the players. Clockwise, each player will take a card and place it in the central stack. The moment two cards showing the same alien or the same letter coincide, any player can cover the central stack with his/her hand and the fastest in doing so must shout out a word beginning with the letter on the covered card.&#10;&#10;Then, he/she must take all the cards from the central stack and, mockingly, distribute them how he/she chooses among the remaining players. This player will place a new card in the central deck to continue the game. The cards that players receive are incorporated to their stack of cards at the bottom.&#10;&#10;4. The game continues in the same way: the moment two aliens or letters coincide again, any player can cover the central stack with his/her hand and, at that moment, he/she must shout out the preceding word and add a new one beginning with the letter on the card that he/she has just been covered.&#10;&#10;Progressively, a word sequence will be formed that must be memorized. If a mistake is made while shouting out the word sequence or if a word is invalid because of a spelling mistake or if he/she has covered the central deck when two cards do not match, the player receives the central stack of cards and places a new card in the central deck to continue the game. The existing word sequence is eliminated and begins to reform.&#10;&#10;5.

(A player can choose to make a joker any color, so she can include or exclude a joker as she wishes during her turn.) Any tokens that were above these will slide down inside the racks. The player keeps all the tokens removed.&#10;&#10;Players take turns removing tokens until either a player is eliminated from the game or no groups of two or more tokens remain. At this point, the game ends and players reveal their secret colors. Whoever has the fewest tokens of her color on the board wins! If two or more players are tied, they compare the tokens they collected during the game; whoever collected fewer of his or her own color wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "The aim in Ninja Dojo Fight! is to prove you're the best Ninja by participating in unsanctioned battles. To help you win, you must break into the dojo and look for the best weapon you can find at the break of dawn. The game is made up of five rounds with each round consisting of three turns followed by a battle phase. Each turn has three phases:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Select: Each player secretly chooses an action.&#10;    Reveal: All players simultaneously reveal their chosen action.&#10;    Resolve: Actions are resolved in ascending order.&#10;&#10;&#10;After three turns, a battle occurs and a new round begins. The player to win the most battles after five rounds is declared the winner. In the event of a tie, the players tied play one additional round, called the showdown; whoever wins the showdown wins the game.&#10;&#10;---&#10;&#10;Ninja Dojo Fight! is a micro game inspired by Entropy. You play as a ninja from one of four rival disciplines. As a ninja in training on your final test, your goal is to win the most battles using the weapons at your disposal.&#10;&#10;The game play has similarly to the main counterpart Entropy, through the use of simultaneous action selection, but it's not quite the same game. With only 42 cards, it is more thematically and technically accessible than Entropy. The visual design is minimalistic and the cards do not have any text.&#10;&#10;",

The results are the speeds at which the players may move their pawns. The players bid for these speed dice in a blind auction. Once all the speed dice have been distributed, the pawns are moved. After any movement, a check is made to see if your worker has kept his balance; if this check fails the coffee is spilled and one marker is lost. Play continues until a player crosses the end line.

You get to choose the dig site, but you are not in control of what will come out of the ground. Once all the treasure is gone, the game ends and the player who acquired the most money wins.

The result of the dice roll determines how many tiles to move the pickax within the dig site. After rolling the dice, move the pickax from the pre-selected dig site to the right and collect the tile that you land on. This treasure tile is then kept on your player scoreboard. When moving the pickax, always skip empty spaces and move from tile to tile like stepping stones. If there are no more treasure tiles to your right, use your remaining moves by continuing from the left side of the dig site.&#10;&#10;After being moved, a pickax must occupy the vacant space left by the collected tile until it is moved again by another player. All players move the same pickax when digging at a particular dig site. Once moved away from the dig site's starting picture label, the pickax is never placed there again.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

At the word card deck you will find 9 Mariano Rajoy's sentences chopped into pieces, so each card of the deck will have one piece of any of the sentences. The objective of the game is to build new sentences up by remixing the original sentences.&#10;&#10;This are some of the sentences conforming the game:&#10;&quot;Un vaso es un vaso y un plato es un plato&quot; (entrevista a Televisi&oacute; de Girona, 23-9-2015).&#10;&ldquo;A glass is a glass and a plate is a plate&rdquo; (interview at Televisi&oacute; de Girona, 2015-9-23).&#10;&quot;Espa&ntilde;a es un gran pa&iacute;s que hace cosas importantes y tiene espa&ntilde;oles&quot; (Mitin del PP, 17-5-2016).&#10;&ldquo;Spain is a great country that makes important things and has got Spanish people&rdquo;. (at a Popular Party's meeting, 2016-5-17).&#10;&quot;Lo que nosotros hemos hecho, cosa que no hizo usted, es enga&ntilde;ar a la gente.&quot; (Tribuna Parlamento, 2-3-2016)&#10;&ldquo;What we have done, which you did not do, is to deceive people&rdquo; (Tribune of the Spanish Parliament, 2016-3-2 ).&#10;&quot;Espa&ntilde;a es una gran naci&oacute;n y los espa&ntilde;oles muy espa&ntilde;oles y mucho espa&ntilde;oles&quot; (Mitin de del PP, 20-5-2015).&#10;&ldquo;Spain is a great nation and the Spanish people is very Spanish and a lot of Spanish&rdquo; (at a Popular Party's meeting, 2016-5-17).&#10;&quot;La cer&aacute;mica de Talavera no es cosa menor, dicho de otra manera: es cosa mayor&quot;.

(Rueda de prensa, 2015-9-24).&#10;&#10;How to play: Eight cards are dealt to each player: six word cards and two &ldquo;Fin de la cita&rdquo;. The first player opens a sentence by placing a card on the table. In turns, each player must continue the sentence by adding a card that is gramaticaly correct with respect to previous word cards; it doesn't need to make any sense. Each &quot;Fin de la cita&quot; allows you to close the sentences: so when a sentence is gramatically closed, the player in turn can close the sentence by using a &quot;Fin de la cita&quot; and he we'll win the sentence.&#10;That is a general explanation of the game rules.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "This CCG is based on the original series. Each player plays with the same core crew cards in the middle of the table. These cards, Kirk, Spock, McCoy and the Enterprise, are in every starter. This is a blessing in that most CCG's make the most popular characters very rare.&#10;&#10;The game can be multi-player but is designed for and best with only two players.  Each player takes turns being the &quot;Current Player&quot;: the crew of the Enterprise, while the opposing player represents the obstacles to the crew as the &quot;Challenging Player&quot;.&#10;&#10;The game revolves around completing episodes as the Current Player. Each episode is made up of three cards, Mission, Plot and Discovery. You have all three cards in a generic form that you can play if you did not draw one of the types.&#10;&#10;You play a mission card then the opponent plays challenges against it. You then play a plot card and more challenges. Then a discovery card and yep, more challenges (well&hellip; really you just resolve any outstanding challenges). At the end each side gets points called XC for how they did or did not do during the Episode phase.  The Current player gets XC for completing the episode while the Challenger gets XC for stifling the Current Player's efforts.&#10;&#10;XC is put on the core crew and crew you enter on your side and the first player to end their turn with 25+ XC total on the crew wins. This means that XC on the core crew will count for each side when it is their turn.&#10;&#10;The shots from the series used on the cards will make Star Trek fans very happy. My favorite card - Shirtless Kirk.&#10;&#10;There is also an expansion for this game. See here&#10;http://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/18487/starfleet-manuevers-checklist-xls&#10;&#10;There were also 6 additional cards, that were chase cards from the Star Trek Phase 3 trading card set.

Is a musictherapy the right treatment for the vegetarian cat? Show that you have the courage, the right tactics and the necessary pinch of luck to become the chief physician .....&#10;&#10;You work as veterinarians in a nutty pet clinic. The animals there are not really ill but&#10;a little strange. The patients cards show how many therapy points are needed to heal the patients. To gather therapy points you have to deal with the strange therapies in the nutty pet clinic.&#10;&#10;Every therapy card is worth at least one therapy point. In order to cure your animal patients it requires a lot of therapy cards. Therapy cards are uncovered one after the other and placed in a row. Whoever thinks that enough therapy cards are displayed places his doctor figure below the last uncovered therapy card, since as soon as a second therapy card of the same kind is uncovered, chaos breaks out in the nutty pet clinic, ending this phase of the game immediately. Whoever has placed his doctor figure in time receives one therapy point for every uncovered therapy card up to his doctors figure, the others are left empty-handed.&#10;&#10;To gather a larger amount of therapy points, the players have to use the special functions of the clinic rooms on the gameboard. Having gathered enough therapy points the players place their feeding bowls in clinic rooms. With the feeding bowls the players gather more therapy points so that they can cure the stranger patients. &#10;So it's up to the players to seek a career in the nutty pet clinic and reach the upper clinic floors.&#10;&#10;Action cards allow special actions and provide surprising events. The player who cures many patients and thus collects most victory points wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "The beginning of the twentieth century was marked by an extraordinary art movement known as Art Nouveau, which aimed to modernize design away from the previously popular eclectic historical styles.&#10;&#10;Alphonse Mucha, born in Moravia in 1860, was one of the artists closely linked to this artistic movement. The Czech became known for his work in 1894 when famous actress Sarah Bernhardt invited him to produce the poster for the play Gismonda.&#10;&#10;From then on, Mucha started producing other posters and advertisements of various products, always emphasizing its most striking features. Her style drew attention because it portrayed with emphasis the feminine forms, in a kind of Byzantine mosaic that plays with colors and floral arabesques.&#10;&#10;In La Muse, we bring a gallery of 20 works by Alphonse Mucha to compose the game cards, produced between 1897 and 1902.&#10;&#10;In the game, we are collectors looking for the most beautiful and valuable works of Alphonse Mucha. By allocating data about Musa's cards, we can collect them for our portfolio by performing special effects and gaining gems.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, the player with the highest gem value is considered the winner!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Players start with two tokens of matching color. Each player rolls the dice and must move one of his tokens the full dice count, in either direction. The board features various locations and special action spots. When a player's token lands on a Big Foot space, they roll the dice again and moves the creature the full count. If the creature moves over an opponent's token, a disk is dispensed and if it is a footprint, that player's token is out of the game. The winner is to be the survivor after Big Foot has removed all other opponents. The game is intended Ages 8 - 14, but it's fun for adults as well.&#10;&#10;",

The Confederate garrison actually outnumbered the Union troops 18,000 to 15,000, but Grant's judgement of his opponent's psychology served him well. The unconditional surrender of the fort on Febuary 16th, 1862, shattered the Confederate defenses in western and middle Tennessee.The equivalent of an entire corps was taken prisoner, and the Cumberland River was opened to the Union Navy. Within weeks Nashville would fall and the remaining Confederate forces would retreat into Mississippi. The victory made a national hero of it's previously unknown author, who here began his rise to command of all the Union armies - U.S. Grant. Yet the battle could have turned out much differently, and the controversy in later years over what really happened and why, would be among the most intense surrounding any action of the war.&#10;&#10;",

The armies are deployed, awaiting orders to move, and in both headquarters the same speech is being presented: &quot;For you, Buttons, the goal is clear: End up on top!&quot; Soon the battle will commence, with each general trying to use the available spies as well as he possibly can to dominate the final battlefield.&#10;&#10;As you might guess from the punny names, Button Up! is a non-serious look at combat during war &ndash; so non-serious, mind you, that the pieces are buttons, none of which are eliminated due to sucking chest wounds during play. In fact, Button Up! is an abstract game in which players try to manipulate the button troops to score more points than the opponent.&#10;&#10;To set up each round of the game, randomly arrange nine buttons in a circle: three red for Buttonaparte, three black for Von York Buttonburg, and three neutral white spies. On a turn, the active player takes one stack that contains a spy, then distributes that stack clockwise one button at a time, with the buttons coming off the bottom of the stack as they're placed. Thus, the first move is a single white button being placed on its neighbor to the left; if that stack is moved on the second turn, the bottom button is placed on its left neighbor, then the white button on top placed to the left of that. If the last button placed matches color with the button it covers, the player who moved it takes another turn. (This doesn't apply if the stack being moved contains more buttons than remaining stacks; in this case, the final buttons are placed on the last stack without rearranging their order.)&#10;&#10;When only one stack remains, the round ends. Each button has strength equal to its height in the stack; players sum their strength, and the player with the most strength earns points equal to the difference between the two sums. If one player now has 15 or more points, he wins; if not, shuffle the buttons and start another round with the player who has the fewest points going first.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Mighty Warriors was produced in the early 1990s by Games Workshop as part of a series of introductory-level miniatures games. The four-game series included Mighty Warriors, Ultra Marines, Kerrunch, and Space Fleet. The game includes dice, floor tiles, door stand-ups, 36 highly detailed Citadel Miniatures, and reference cards for army lists and spells.&#10;&#10;In Mighty Warriors, players choose from either a band of Heroes or Skaven Ratmen. The Heroes are led by a Noble Knight, a Fearless Dwarf, and a Heroic Elf while the Skaven Ratmen are led by a Chaos Wizard and four Skaven Champions. The Elf and Chaos Wizard can cast spells. The other characters have differing combat abilities.&#10;&#10;Players set up the castle from modular floor tiles, which are then connected by stand-up doors. The players then position their forces throughout the rooms of the castle. Finally a &ldquo;shield&rdquo; for each side is placed.&#10;&#10;The game is played in phases including Magic, Movement, Missile Combat, Melee Combat, and Recovery from Stuns. Each player attacks the other while moving from one room of the castle to another. A player wins by capturing the opponent&rsquo;s shield.&#10;&#10;This game is basically a &ldquo;light&rdquo; version of HeroQuest or Warhammer Quest, more of a skirmish style than exploration, Dungeon Crawl.

For example, let&rsquo;s say the ITZI card reads, &ldquo;It&rsquo;z an animal.&rdquo; If a player has a letter card with a &ldquo;K&rdquo; on it, they could call out &ldquo;kangaroo&rdquo; and at the same time smack down that letter card on top of the ITZI card.

The discovery of gold, in one valley by the river in today&rsquo;s Yukon in Canada, had started the greatest gold rush ever related to Alaska wild-west. Get there as one of two to four gold- miners and experience one of two possible game variants this title offers. Each variant, based on different principles, stands as a complete game and offers a different gaming encounter&hellip;&#10;In the first game variant each gold-digger is in a search for the best parcels in his landscape to claim them for treasures to be gained. Golden nuggets bring victory points and rubies are to be possibly spent as resources for claim tokens in random and limited offer. In an auction player can smart out the others for strategic claim tokens or bluff them out of rubies as well. .. in other words checking on others might work a bit too! &#10;The first player, in a round based flow, who manages to dig through to the other end of his landscape, presented by four boards in a row, closes the game. However the winner is the richest gold-digger, a player with the most collected golden nuggets after the final VP count with possible penalties. &#10;The strategy and tactical decisions are made upon open information only.  The depth of pre-planning can lead to overwhelming dimension as well as it can be taken as a no rush family friendly play-style.&#10;&#10;The second game variant offers exploding fun and whole different player&rsquo;s interaction. Being quick and cool headed, knowing a landscape to claim is a sure way, still outsmarting or bluffing the others might help in some cases! &#10;Winner is an experienced and ambitious gold-beater with the most popularity points for a council seat. Popularity is in relation to four down-town VIPs such as brothel madam, sheriff, mayor and horse trader. Each round player has a set of 10 unique tetris shape claim tokens to place them onto his set of four landscape boards. This happens in a race that starts with uncovering a random request card for this turn.&#10; The only closed information is the one before the moment of truth, when the picky requests of celebrities shall be satisfied. How well did you dig for them? Your popularity in four tracks may rise as well as it can fall by not following the exactions for gold and rubies.&#10;&#10;Via the title Klondike 1896 players are looping back in time to meet one of the earliest and never before published creations of Vladim&iacute;r Such&yacute; presented by StragooGames (SGG).&#10;&#10;",

Two to four players assume the role of the crime lords and compete to become the richest of all.&#10;&#10;To do so, they need to recruit safe crackers and use their skills to crack vaults.

The deck is shuffled, then set up with three or four &quot;Feeding time!&quot; cards shuffled into the deck at various points. On a turn, a player first turns up a card from the deck if the market is empty (as it is as the start of the game). Then the player looks at the fish and plant cards in the market and decides whether to pass or try to buy them. If he passes, he takes $2 from the bank and adds the top card to the market; if he wants to buy, all other players get to influence what's on the market and what the cards cost.&#10;&#10;First, each other player chooses one of their five action cards for use in phase 1 of a buy. These cards force the active player to add, remove or swap a card from the market or simply allow the card player to make a fish swap of his own! (Players can also pass, with all action cards but the &quot;pass&quot; being set aside.) Second, each other player chooses one of their five action cards for use in phase 2 of a buy. These cards add or subtract 1 from the cost of the market, or double or halve the cost of the market. In the latter case, the player of the card receives money from the active player instead of those coins going to the bank.&#10;&#10;Once the goods and the cost are set, the active player chooses to buy all the fish and plants on offer or none of them. The cost is equal to the sum of the card values, plus or minus any modifications, then doubled or halved as appropriate. All purchased cards go into a player's personal aquarium. If a player has two identical fish, he can move them to a separate breeding tank where they will earn him 1-3 coins each turn.&#10;&#10;Each time a &quot;Feeding time!&quot; card is revealed, players reveal one &quot;food cost&quot; card at random, then pay money equal to that cost times the number of stars on fish and plants in their aquariums. Any fish not fed starve and float away to the big toilet bowl in the sky. Each plant in an aquarium reduces the food cost by one.&#10;&#10;After the final &quot;Feeding time!&quot;, players count the stars on their non-breeding fish, then receive bonuses for collecting all colored fish of the same size, all three sizes of fish of the same color and different varieties of plants.

As the dragon, your ultimate goal is to amass the largest treasure hoard to solidify your place as the most formidable dragon of all time.  The other dragons will envy your success and try to stop you at every turn, while they try to amass their own treasure.  Only greed, strategy, cunning, and ruthlessness will allow you to prevail and take what is rightfully yours as all others will bow before you.&#10;&#10;Each dragon has its own strengths and weaknesses, along with their own preferred terrain, breathe weapon and special ability.  The dragon will fly from its lair, encountering challenges, ranging from easy to extremely difficult.  If a dragon chooses to fight an encounter tile, dice are rolled and if the dragon is successful it gets the gold that the encounter is worth.  Dragon versus dragon combat is a possibility if you wish to test your strength against the others and gain additional rewards. Once all the encounter tiles have been removed from the playing area, the game ends and the dragon with the most gold wins.&#10;&#10;There is a 110 card deck in the game that allows players do a variety of things.  There are cards that can strengthen your dragon and there are cards that can hinder other dragon&rsquo;s abilities (i.e. Attack Power, Speed and Carry).  Additionally, there are cards that have the ability to manipulate game play of your choosing.&#10;&#10;The playing area is modular and customizable depending on the amount of players and the size of game you wish to play. Recommendations are included in the rules, but you make each game as big or small as you like.  While gathering gold is the main objective of the game, the underlying intent is to bring friends and family together to have fun.&#10;&#10;",

The judge draws a cat card from the top of the deck and gives the cat a name. The rest of the players each build a story using the cards in their hand. They tell the story to the judge, embellishing all they want (that's the fun part!), and the judge picks their favorite story as the winner!&#10;&#10;",
