    "description": "On May 11, 1944 at eleven o&rsquo;clock in the evening, nearly 2000 cannons opened fire on the German defenses of the Gustav Line. The French, under the command of General Juin (CEF), and the Polish, Canadians, Indians and British, under General Leese, (8th Army) launch an assault to open the road to Rome while the Americans under General Clark (5th US Army) carry out a support attack on the Tyrrhenian coast.&#10;&#10;Operation Diadem follows the unsuccessful attacks on the Gustav Line during the winter of 1943-1944. Confronted by the Allies, the German units remain determined and give up nothing. In the town of Cassino and around the monastery of Monte Cassino, totally destroyed by February&rsquo;s massive bombardments, the green devils of the 1.Fallschirmj&auml;ger-Division, supported by mountain troops, will defy the assailants until the night of May 17-18. In this game, VaeVictis takes you to the assault of the Aurunci Mountains. The French troops will have to infiltrate as Juin had imagined. The game also captures the harshness of the hand-to-hand combat between the Polish, British and German paratroopers. In the Liri Valley, the breaches allow the Canadian and British armored forces to be quickly launched on the road to Rome.&#10;&#10;Cassino 44 is a game in the World War Two Series from the magazine Vae Victis (Ardennes 44, Alsace 44, Korsun 44, Targu Frumos 44 and Arnhem 44).&#10;&#10;In this game, the player will have to assault of the Aurunci Mountains.

    "description": "Pavlov&rsquo;s Dogs is a pseudo-psychological card game of memory and conditioning. A fast, engaging game of following the rules and acting like fools! You&rsquo;ll be drooling for more!&#10;&#10;Players are dogs working together during a series of tests (rounds) given to them by famous Dogtors such as Sigmund Fetch, Collie Jung, and Bark F. Skinner! Each round one player is the Dogtor and ensures that the dogs are following the rules.&#10;&#10;All players start with 3 bones. If they ever make a mistake they lose a bone and if one player is out of bones the game ends immediately. However,&#10;&#10;The dogs (players) are tested each round by being dealt 5 cards from the test desk which they do not look at. The test deck consists of numbered cards in 3 suits (BLUE,YELLOW and BROWN) each featuring 6 different dog commands (SIT,SHAKE,SPEAK, FETCH,ROLLOVER and BEG). There are also 6 BELL cards in the test deck which are WHITE and valued at zero.&#10;&#10;On a player&rsquo;s turn they will flip one of their dealt test cards and say the total value of the test. The first player may flip a YELLOW SHAKE ONE and they would state &ldquo;ONE&rdquo;.  The second player may flip a BROWN BEG TWO and they would state &ldquo;THREE&rdquo;, and so on.&#10;&#10;The parameters/rules may change the value of a card or add an action requirement when a card type is played. Example rules are: SIT commands = ZERO or Bark when any BLUE card is played. Each round another parameter/rule is added making it more challenging to complete the full series of test. It is the Dogtor's job each round to ensure the dogs are following the rules.&#10;&#10;If a dog announces the total value of the test correctly, the Dogtor will say GOOD DOG. This signifies that the dog was correct and the next dog (player) may go. In the event that a dog is incorrect, the Dogtor will say BAD DOG.&#10;&#10;Whenever you are a bad dog, you lose one bone. The Dogtor then resets the total test value to zero and play continues until all dogs are out of test cards.  The game end immediately once one dog is out of bones and all players fail. However, players may share bones in between rounds as long as each player has at least one bone but no more than 3 bones. If all players still have bones at the end of your final round, you pass! Your collective score is based on the total number of bones at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Pavlov's Dogs has 3 levels of difficulty: Puppy (3 rounds), Dog (5 rounds) or Wolf (8 rounds). All players decide their level at the beginning of the game to determine the number of rounds they will play.&#10;&#10;There is also a fun TEAM VARIANT in which players split into 2 teams and play 4 rounds to determine who did better.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Their earliest followers harnessed fragments of their immeasurable power in earthly objects. Chaos and destruction spread throughout the land leaving no family untouched by darkness. A great war ensued and these once great objects of cosmic power became lost and forgotten in time&hellip;&#10;&#10;You lied to the other scientists on the expedition to Am&rsquo;harb, an uninhabited island in the Pacific. Only you, a true servant of the Ancient Ones, is powerful enough to move the deadly dark towers surrounding the island.&#10;&#10;Manipulate the towers to strategically scatter your priests and cultists around the island and gain control of the dark altars. Excavate esoteric resources left behind by lost civilizations. Wisely exchange them for the cosmic powers of the Ancient One to advance your position.&#10;&#10;Can you solve the Towers of Am&rsquo;harb and unlock the secrets before your rivals? Do this before the other cults to ensure you and you alone lead humanity from the deadly light and into the peace and safety of a new dark age!&#10;&#10;Gameplay Overview&#10;&#10;In Towers of Am&rsquo;harb, you are a leader of a doom cult, and you are competing with others just like you, all trying to unleash the Ancient One of their worship to conquer the world!&#10;&#10;Players will take turns moving their set of 4 different sized discs, manipulating them according to the rules of the mathematical puzzle toy Tower of Hanoi/Brahma. Then you send your followers(disciples) to the 2 columns you just moved a disc into, in order to gain control of scoring altars that provide doom points at the end of the game. Your followers come in different sizes, 3 priests which provides 3 influence, and 6 cultists which provides 1 influence; each follower spreads influence to the 8 surrounding spaces, so it can influence more than one altar.&#10;&#10;Since players will sit and play their discs on different orthogonal sides of the map, the result is that the vertical columns you can play into will be the horizontal rows of the next player, and generates to very interesting interactions. When playing your followers on to the board, you will need also to pay a cost depending on how crowded the area you are entering, which can be offset by the height of your towers, so you must plan ahead on where you need to concentrate your efforts.&#10;&#10;There are 8 different Lovecraftian Ancient Ones to worship in this game, each with a different Cosmic Power for players to rely on. The map is made from dual-sided modular boards, with different layouts for 2/3/4 player scaling; you can start with symmetric distribution of scoring altars, or flip them around for dynamic asymmetric layouts.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the first player plays all 9 of their followers to the board, then all other players gets to take one more turn. Then players resolves each altar on the board one by one and give out doom points to the players with highest influence. The player who accumulates the highest doom points awakens the Ancient One of their worship, and releases unfathomable cosmic horror upon the world.&#10;&#10;Disclaimer: Moaideas Game Design is not liable for the unexpected or premeditated summoning of any Ancient One or Elder God and in no way endorses or condones belief or membership of any doom cult.

The pieces are solid cylinders that lie in the grooves of the board in between the Hubs. The grooves that lie along the longer edges of the board are the goal lines. Each player has two Woods and two Granites while the Flag is a communal piece.&#10;&#10;Each move is a single 90 degree rotation in any direction off a Hub. Woods can only do ordinary rotations (Free moves). Granites can do Free moves but can also shunt past any Woods that they&rsquo;re connected to (Shunt moves). The only way you can move the Flag is by rotating it off any of your own pieces that it&rsquo;s connected to (Flag moves). Players take alternate turns to make their plays. You have two moves per play to move your pieces, and you can also move the Flag as many times as you wish and at any time in your play.&#10;&#10;Create structures with your pieces to move the Flag forward, and try to break up any structures that your opponent may be trying to build. Once you have moved the Flag onto your opponent&rsquo;s goal line, you&rsquo;re the winner.&#10;&#10;",

The Germans hoped to take Russia out of the war, but they never dreamed how much the world would change.&#10;&#10;Now, Against the Odds lets you explore the tangled facets of the Russian Civil War, with the historical situation exemplified by a game that handles two to four players&hellip;with up to three of them commanding the &ldquo;White&rdquo; Russian factions! (In multi-player games, if the Reds are defeated, the game isn&rsquo;t over yet!) For Bloody Honor: Civil War Russkaya captures the interactions of political influence, railways, foreign intervention, and the discord among the White factions that gave the Bolsheviks their best chance to win in a battle against &mdash; as it seemed to them &mdash; their internal enemies and the whole Western Alliance. (Yes, there were British, French, Canadian, Australian, Indian, Japanese, and even U.S. troops fighting in Russia as late as 1920&hellip;and even later for the Japanese).&#10;&#10;For Bloody Honor includes 10 game turns, each representing 4 months of real time from the end of 1918 to the end of 1921, and driven by chit pull which will guarantee no two turns are alike. Units represent organized troops of various sizes, with each counter (except tanks) of relatively equal strength. Yes, depending on the situations, this can become a &ldquo;buckets of dice&rdquo; game&hellip;or the fate of a region (and the political points that go with it) may hinge on a single unit. Defeat can be costly, not only in lost units but in the potential for defecting as your units may decide the other side has more to offer them!&#10;&#10;Can you, as the Reds, repeat history and form a Union of Soviet Socialists Republics?

Now, Firefight Games offers it as a wargame. The game is unique for the rules cover everything in simplicity yet, making the correct decision makes it tough to master! Political influence and recruiting plays a vital and realistic role, for these decisions will impact military units and their use! Technology (tanks, aircraft) is important but it alone cannot win the game. The beautiful area map conveys at a glance the massive expanses of the war, for each area plays a critical political role. The game is deceptively simple to learn, yet, like Chess, hard to master. A grand strategic game on the Russian Civil War from 1918 to 1922, with each turn being four months, units represent 5 - 15,000 men, while tanks, aircraft, armor cars and armor trains are abstracted amounts. One player plays the Red , the other plays the White Factions (Polish, Kolchak, Denikin etc). The map is divided into zones. The game, designed by Mark Woloshen, designed a game that is used frequently by his students to learn about the complexities of the RCW. Thus, it is focused on how the political influence and control impacted the military events. One cannot win by military means alone. The game relies on activations and recruiting new men to man the armies is of major importance subject the game's political realities! Unlike other strategic RCW games, this plays in a few hours' time.&#10;&#10;",

Tiny Farms features a simple but unique dice rondel with shared pawns that you will use to collect animals for your farms.&#10;&#10;Each player is a farmer managing two 4x4 farms. On a turn, animals are drafted and placed on the farm by writing their initials (or by drawing, if you're feeling creative). Drafting involves a special rondel with eight sections containing the animals. The rondel is overlayed by a wheel with different hole patterns &mdash; the patent-pending Rolldel Wheel-o-Matic! &mdash; that reveal only two animals in each section. As the wheel rotates, different animals will be available. One red and one blue meeple travel clockwise around the rondel.&#10;&#10;Each round, roll dice equal to the number of players, plus one. Players then take turn drafting a die, moving either the red or blue farmer meeple that number of sections, and placing the two animals from that section onto their farm that matches the color of the farmer. The last die remaining after all players have taken one is used to rotate the wheel.&#10;&#10;Players also start with some milk tokens that can modify the values of dice by &plusmn;1.&#10;&#10;The game ends after ten rounds (with your farms hopefully now being full), and players score points. Each animal has a different scoring conditions, such as sets of adjacent animals of the same kind or different kinds, or the most animals of a kind between all players. You also get points for unused milk tokens, and lose points for any size difference between your two farms.&#10;&#10;",

There are 21 pre-printed images on the board, showing seven different types of scary haunted house resident. 20 of these images are covered with randomly placed, face-down tiles.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player flips one tile and tries to match the tile revealed with the only image on the board not covered with a tile. If the tile matches, the player places it over the top of the pre-printed image, with the image side of the tile face up, thereby revealing a new pre-printed image to be matched where the tile was previously positioned.&#10;&#10;Tiles that are revealed but don't match an image are also moved to a new spot to make it harder to match the token on future turns.  Play continues until all tokens have been matched, and the winner is the player who matched the most images.&#10;&#10;Damm/Egmont published Nordic editions have the added twist that there are 21 monster tiles instead of just 20, but one is removed before beginning and exactly one player during the game will have a chance to guess (write down) who they think 'mystery monster' is; a correct guess will be worth +2 points at the end of the game, while a wrong one carries a penalty of -2 points.&#10;&#10;From the back of the box / translation found at funagain&#10;&#10;The old haunted castle is filled with lots of creepy characters, all trying to find their own shadow.

Each player start with three RPM cards that can be played on theirs or an opponent's turn. Players earn more cards by landing on designated RPM track spaces. Multiple card combinations can be played to enhance effects or counter one another. RPMs last for one turn and include NOS, off-road tires, run-flat tires, green lights, tire spikes and sideswipes.&#10;&#10;The player with the most trophies after five races is the tournament champion!&#10;&#10;",

For 1-3, a Red question is asked, for 4-6 a Green one, for 7-9 a Yellow one, and for 10-12 a Blue one. Each question is worth the number rolled on the die.&#10;&#10;The questions are devilishly hard and sometimes feature trick questions. Examples: Which part, the bowl or the grinder, is the mortar? In medieval times, the first hay cut in the season was called the Math. What was the second cut called? (Answer: Aftermath) Most deal with word origins and obscure knowledge. Each card also features a small tidbit of information about the answer.&#10;&#10;The first player or team to get to 31 points is the winner. Replay value of the game is somewhat limited since only a single question set was ever produced, but the game is well worth picking up.

Grand Master Jean Parisot de la Valette (GM 1557-1568) had a force of 592 knights, to which several thousand arms-bearing men drawn from the Maltese population were also added. The Ottomans quickly defeated the Maltese militia, became master of the countryside and laid siege to the fortress, which was stubbornly defended by the Knights Hospitallers. After four months of siege, the knights, in a desperate fight over St. Elmo Fort and its natural harbor, inflicted heavy casualties (according to reports, 7,000 dead) on the Ottoman forces. Following the landing of 6,000 - 8,000 reinforcements from Sicily, the Knights again defeated the Ottomans, which embarked and left.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Conquer the world with history's greatest warlords under your command.&#10;&#10;The game plays in 4 turns where each player plays a ruler from history and conquers territories using a simple dice mechanic.&#10;The deck of world conquerors cards generates effects and goals to modify and drive the action.  If nobody has conquered the world by the end of the 4th turn to win immediately, the player whose empire got the largest at any given point wins.&#10;&#10;Each card can be played in one of 3 ways: Generals allow you to place a pawn in that card's territory to be used for rerolls in combats in or adjacent to the territory.  Playing cards as agents gives you one time effects that reflect that historical figure's abilities (Stalin assassinates, Victoria adds an extra die on a naval attack).  Playing cards as rulers gives you their ability for the duration of your turn and sets a goal that reaching it will net you a power bonus at the end of your turn.&#10;&#10;At the start of your turn, you're issued a number of tokens.  This number escalates by one during each player turn to ramp up the epic nature of the game.  You also get the bonus when somebody plays a ruler (including you) in one of your territories, and you'll get it at the end of your turn if you reach your ruler's goals. Tokens convert into armies controlling territories in successful attacks and are spent to pay for failed attacks and sea attacks as a Supply Cost.  Each time you pay the Supply Cost, it escalates.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Gameplay DetailsOn your turn, you campaign by throwing one die for each territory you control adjacent to a target territory. The defender throws one die for their defending army plus another for each adjacent territory they control. The highest die wins. Losses and Naval attacks have an escalating Supply Cost. When you are unwilling or unable to pay the Supply cost, your turn ends. Make it count, though, because you only get four turns.&#10;&#10;Strategic depth is layered onto this simple system by the deck of conqueror cards. Each historical figure has special powers based on their history, such as Erik the Red making unsupplied naval attacks, or Stalin using assassination to eliminate enemies. The cards may be played as your empire's ruler (which makes their power last your whole turn), a local agent (which gives you the power just once), or a general (which ignores their power but gives you combat rerolls). Ruler cards also have a strategic goal, such as Elizabeth's &ldquo;No one else controls a continent&rdquo; or Caesar's &ldquo;Win 5 attacks.&rdquo; Fulfilling these goals gets you a power bonus at the end of your turn.&#10;&#10;In the grand tradition of global conquest games, World Conquerors is epic in scope, but it addresses the genre's traditional shortcomings.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Short Play Time - just four turns per player each game. It plays in about an hour. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     No Player Elimination - each turn you get a new ruler, regardless of the last one's fate.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Quick combat resolution - one army per territory makes battles quick and easy, focusing strategy on card play instead of mass dicefests. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Reduced Kingmaking and Spoiling - ruler goals drive the action leaving little room for spite. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     No Hopeless Positions - supply is based on both time and territory, so it's possible to rebuild a shattered empire from no territories at all. Everybody is in it until their last turn, unless somebody conquers the whole world and wins instantly.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Use economic, military and subterfuge strategies to thwart the neighboring clans and advance your clan to eminence.&#10;&#10;Border Reivers is a game of strategy, warfare and chance  for 2 to 4 players, aged 12 to adult.

Soon enough, you find yourself digging holes in the ground and planting seeds of every kind. But in the shadow of these stems, hungry snails are waiting, ready to dash towards your precious labor and have their fill of your little paradise. Will you be able to avoid this disaster?&#10;&#10;In Spring Fever, players are planting flowers in their gardens while trying to avoid the snails that will eat these blooms. The card deck consists of a deck of cards with flowers (valued at 3) and snails (valued -1 to -10). The first player draws four cards, lays what he claims is the lowest valued card face-up in front of him, then passes the cards to the left. The next player can either:&#10;&#10;&bull; Accept this player's claim, in which case she draws a card to bring the hand back up to four cards, then takes a turn herself, claiming one card, etc.&#10;&#10;&bull; Or call the previous player's bluff by revealing the three cards she was passed. If the previous player lied, he must take all the snails in the three cards revealed; in addition the doubting player can hand over her largest snail or take a flower card. If the previous player told the truth, the penalties are reversed. In either case, the doubting player will take the next turn by filling her hand to four cards, choosing one card, etc.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player can't refill the hand to four cards. This player takes the lowest card remaining, then everyone tallies their points. The player with the highest total wins, with the number of flowers being the tiebreaker, if needed.&#10;&#10;",

Then they start racing!&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player rolls the five dice, sets aside any she wants to keep, then rolls up to two more times, rerolling dice set aside, if desired. The dice depict curves or straights in three different colors, and after the player stops rolling, she chooses all the dice of one color and must use all of them to move on the track. Colored track on the player board can be moved through only with dice of the appropriate color, while any die color can be used to cross gray track; if a player can't use all movement for a color, she must choose a different color. A player cannot cross the same square twice. End your movement in a tight corner, and you take another turn immediately.&#10;&#10;Players take turns until one reaches the finish line, which triggers the final round. After all players have taken the same number of turns, whoever has driven the farthest across the finish line wins. Variants in the rulebook include an option for oil slicks that take two dice to cross, a point system for a multi-race world championship, and a two lap race on the Indianapolis board that includes a shortcut. The challenge in this latter race is that you're still restricted from crossing the same square twice.

These represent historic events in space history and can be played to speed you progress or hinder your opponents. After completing the required number of missions, be the first to land on the Moon and win the game. MOONSHOT has a wealth of detail and flavor for the space enthusiast. If you're big on space travel or really enjoy space history, this game is a must.

The players who can pay the rent at end of game without &quot;hitting the wall&quot; wins.

Players then pick the sushi, side items such as ginger or wasabi from the bar until the timed sushi bar de-activates, shutting off the fans.&#10;&#10;Players continue drawing and fulfilling orders until someone hits the target money goal, and wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Each player in 5 Minuten Puzzle takes one of the player sheets &mdash; making sure that everyone is using the same side &mdash; and a pen. One side of the sheet shows a roughly hexagonal grid composed of black hexes and blue and red circles (collectively &quot;spaces&quot;), while the other side has these hexes and circles arranged like a bear's head.&#10;&#10;On a turn, any player rolls the die, then you each must draw one of the shapes next to this die result&mdash; e.g., a circle, two hexes, and another circle in a line &mdash; into the grid, then cross it out to indicate that you can't use it again. You can place the first shape anywhere, then all subsequent shapes you add must touch something you've drawn previously. If you've used both shapes for a number, you can choose any available shape, then cross it out. If you can't place a shape or decline to do so, you must still cross one out.&#10;&#10;After twelve die rolls, you will have three or more spaces still open (because the grid has 51 spaces). You then score penalty points for each unfilled space: 3 for red, 2 for blue, and 1 for black. Additionally you score 1 penalty point for each different area of unfilled spaces in your grid. Whoever has the fewest penalty points wins.&#10;&#10;As a variant for experience players, each player can fill in 0-3 spaces in their grid before starting play. This possibly allows you to have a lower score, but only if you can still place all of the shapes in your grid.&#10;&#10;",

And with a 5-10 minute play time, it&rsquo;s easy to fit a game in while waiting in line or riding in a car (playing while driving is NOT recommended).  We hope you enjoy playing Mine, All Mine!&#10;&#10;Game Play Overview:&#10;Each player starts with 3 Ship cards.  Each card has 4 options to chose from and players can play as few as 1 up to their entire hand each round.  They play these Ship cards to control and mine resource laden planets, with all players laying down their chosen cards at the same time. When the resources are divided up (based on a fleet's total Speed, Attack and Cargo) points are awarded accordingly. Then, new Ship cards are dealt, equal to the number that were just played, beginning with the player with the lowest score. New Planets are dealt and the next round begins.  After 3 rounds the game ends and the player with the greatest score emerges victorious!&#10;&#10;",
