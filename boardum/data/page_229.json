In addition to the standard numbers and suits the cards also contain a letter of the alphabet.&#10;&#10;The players are attempting to create &quot;runs&quot;, &quot;groups&quot; and &quot;words&quot;. A Run is four or more cards in the same suit in sequence. A Group is three or more of a kind. A Word is formed using the letters on the cards and can be any non-proper word found in a standard dictionary. A game consists of seven rounds, and in each round a player must form a specific number of Runs, Groups and Words.&#10;&#10;Each player is dealt a number of cards, the exact number of which varies depending on the round in play. Each turn the player draws the top card from the deck or from the discard pile then plays as many cards as possible (either by forming new Runs, Groups or Words or by adding them onto cards which have already been played, either by themselves or by other players). Finally, they discard one of their remaining cards. The round ends when one player manages to empty their hand.&#10;&#10;Players gain points by forming the number of Groups, Runs and Words specified for the round and for the cards in the melds they created. They lose points for cards left in their hand when the round ends. The player with the highest total after all seven rounds is the winner.&#10;&#10;An interesting variation of Rummy, Tryce adds an element of strategy to that game.&#10;&#10;Belongs to the 3M Gamette Series.  It was also released in a &quot;butterbox&quot; or &quot;butterdish&quot; version.&#10;&#10;",

The gallant but weary soldiers of the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) now prepared a daring invasion of Syria that could put them in artillery range of the enemy capital in a matter of days. Somehow, the IDF reformed the battered 7th Armored Brigade and the 21st Tank Division and sent them forward with the 20th Brigade's old Super Sherman tanks in support. Brilliant flanking maneuvers, a spirit of improvisation, and further reinforcements created a miniature blitzkrieg. Syrian troops and leaders alike panicked. The call went out for help from brother Arab nations. Only the timely arrival of the Iraqi 3rd Tank Division halted the advance of near Damascus. At that point, the United States put its forces on global nuclear alert to head off a Soviet para drop into Syria, and both superpowers proceeded to clamp down on their clients, ending the operation and with it the &quot;Yom Kippur War.&quot;&quot;&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Turn: 1-2 days (variable)&#10;Hex: 1.5 miles / 2.4 km&#10;Unit: Company to Battalion&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 22&quot; X 34&quot; mapsheet&#10;One countersheet (240 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 12 page rules booklet&#10;&#10;5 replacement counters were issued in S&amp;T 171.&#10;&#10;",

Created by French illustrator Claude Combacau, Catsass won a Golden Blog Awards 2015 in the &ldquo;Best Comic&rdquo; category. First book to be released in spring 2016 by Planeta (publisher in Spain of the comics Game of Thrones, Star Wars and The Walking Dead Chronicles).&#10;&#10;Developed by board game designer Delphin Druelle at Eclosion Games, &lsquo;Make a Mess&rsquo; features the comic&rsquo;s perfectly irreverent cat making an uncontrollable mess in the house &ndash; while trying not to get caught.&#10;&#10;HOW TO PLAY :&#10;&#10;Players begin with 8 Cat Prank cards and 3 Bonus cards.&#10;&#10;Each player has to make 3 actions during is turn: &#10;1. Roll the dice to move the Parents from one room to another. &#10;2. Move the Cat where you want (or stay in the same room). &#10;3. Play a Cat Prank card in the room where the Cat is located. Use your Bonus cards whenever you want to change the rules of the game and play tricks against your opponents.&#10;&#10;Each Cat Prank card has a level of nastiness from 1 to 5. If a player reach 10 points or above in a room, he has to take responsibility for the mess and put a Cat Paw Pawn.&#10;&#10;If the Parents go to the room where your Cat Paw Pawn is, you're out of the game.&#10;&#10;To win: be the first to play all your Cat Prank cards or last cat standing!&#10;&#10;TESTED AND APPROVED :&#10;&#10;Here are the top 5 game features that the gamers have liked the most:&#10;&#10;1. The players&rsquo; jokes triggered thanks to the Catsass comic art illustrations &#10;2. The level of adrenaline which quickly grows exponentially during the game &#10;3. The possibility to play tricks at the worst possible timing (for the opponent) &#10;4. The duration (15min max) which allows for successive games (revenge!) &#10;5.

Before recorded history, songs tell of a chieftain named Odif who led Clan Black to many victories and in time chiseled out the land of Blackwallen. He declared himself king and established laws for a royal bloodline. Descendents of Odif occupied the throne through centuries of in-fighting, war, and famine. To many, Blackwallen&rsquo;s constant instability meant it was cursed. To others, it was just home.&#10;&#10;One hundred years ago a new age dawned. Adjacent kingdoms were uninterested in conquering the land, and peace at home meant security in Blackwallen for perhaps the first time. With security came cultural and scientific pursuits and the king himself declared an &ldquo;Age of Peace&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;King Leopold is the third king of the Age of Peace. He has levied trade agreements with neighbors into alliances. He is a young king, but already the people talk of his wisdom.&#10;&#10;When he dies, a very real void will be left. His queen will no longer have a doting husband. His children will be without a loving father. The Orbly Street Tavern will no doubt miss its masked late night musician known only as &ldquo;The Night Singer&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;The Kingdom of Blackwallen will no longer have their beloved monarch.&#10;&#10;Blood Royals is a game about two relatives trying to claim the throne from a dying king. Secretly choose your action, reveal and then use your skills (and a bit of luck) to conquer lands and gain the favor of influential people with powerful abilities.&#10;&#10;This is a roll and write game. All you need to play is the perforated game sheets in this book, some pencils, and some dice.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Stealth Chess is a chess-under-imperfect-information variant, a kind of cross between chess and Stratego. In name and power, the pieces are standard chessmen, but they are shaped like Stratego pieces so that each player can only identify the pieces of his own army. At the start both sides arrange their armies any way they like on the first two ranks. Pawns are allowed to move two squares forward on either the first or second rank. The object is to capture the enemy King. The identity of a piece is revealed when it is captured. The official rules then call for the piece to be returned to its previous owner (off the board), facing away from its captor.&#10;&#10;Stealth Chess has the same pieces as conventional chess(16 Black &amp; 16 White) but unlike traditional chess, all pieces look the same and have the pieces title printed on the back side so your only chance to win is to memorize the movement of your opponents and which piece was moved. This memory play helps with regular chess play by improving your memory.&#10;&#10;The game begins with pieces being randomly placed by each player in the first and second row of each side of the board. You decide the strategic possibilities of the placement of your pieces. For example, you might put your Queen front-row center and hide your King in a corner. The excitement begins with the first move. From that point forward, you must try to figure out your opponent's pieces by their movements and seek out and capture the King. Of course, you may &quot;disguise&quot; a powerful piece by moving it as if it were a mere Pawn--until you strike without warning. No check, no checkmate. Boom! Victory is yours.&#10;&#10;There are several different rule sets included that the players agree upon beforehand. The simplest is a standard opening position setup. You'll know which piece is which at the beginning of the game and the trick is to remember.&#10;&#10;",

This game combines bluffing, hand management, and your ability to be a jerk in one tidy package. In a round, each player starts with a hand of five cards, with the cards being similar to a Pairs deck (one 1, two 2s, up to ten 10s), but with some of the cards from 1-5 being labeled &quot;low&quot; and some from 6-10 being labeled &quot;high&quot;; if a card isn't labeled, then it can be anything from 1-10.&#10;&#10;Each player reveals one card simultaneously, and whoever reveals the highest card starts. On a turn, the player choose one card from hand, places it face down with 1-3 honey chips on it, then draw a new card. The next player can either place the same number of chips on it to pass the card to the next player or take the card and chips; if the card matches a number the player already has, they are out of the round and must ante a number of chips equal to the card number to the pot. If no one takes the card, then whoever first played the card must take it, scoring lots of chips but killing themselves if they played a number they already had.&#10;&#10;The round continues until a player has cards that sum to at least 35, they have three cards valued 1-5 in front of them, or they're the only one still in the round. That player wins the pot, then everyone scores points equal to the number of honey chips they have. After a certain number of rounds, whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

A player controls at least one but can control up to three armies per game. You can use the board sections to create inlets, peninsulas, isthmuses, lakes, and more. Adding vortex and terrain markers allows you even more control over the layout of the game board and how it will be traversed. Your ability to take advantage of the layout of the battlefield is crucial to victory and defeat.&#10;&#10;Each army is made up of 12 Army Units, one General, and one Supply Pawn. At the start of your turn, you must decide if you are going for supplies or moving your army.  On taking possession of the dice: first see if any of your Army Units are in danger and if so, respond defensively; second, see if any of your opponent's Army Units are vulnerable and, if possible, attack; third, if neither of these choices applies, go for supplies. Sun Tzu says: &quot;Do not move without considering all the possibilities. Move always with a clear purpose.&quot;&#10;&#10;The rules for movement of your army allow you to simulate many strategies from the ancient battlefield. Even &ldquo;cavalry charges&rdquo; are possible&mdash;where a unit dashes across the board to attack an enemy position. Your mission is to surround and eliminate enemy Army Units until only your Army is left, leaving you the victor.&#10;Deals and alliances can be made in the open or in secret. But only one commander can emerge victorious: knowing when and with whom to form alliances and when to break them can sometimes determine who wins and who loses.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Fate of the Norns: Gulveig is a highly competitive card game themed around the struggle for supremacy involving four clans of nordic gods and mythical giants.&#10;&#10;Play is simple and quick, based on bidding for a power total against the other players.&#10;&#10;The game is based on a northern European card game called &quot;Tukstantis&quot;. The 4 &quot;clans&quot; have a parallel to classic card &quot;suits&quot; and achieving clan &quot;supremacy&quot; is akin to having a suit being &quot;trump&quot;.&#10;&#10;Cards are dealt to each player, and then players bid for the three treasure cards in the center of the table. The highest bidder receives those cards.&#10;&#10;A trick is led, and players must follow suit if they are able. If not, they may play a card of another clan, but the combat strength is reduced.&#10;&#10;Advanced rules:&#10;- Certain cards can be swapped out for others that add another dimension to play&#10;&#10;- Players can be dealt &quot;roles&quot; which grant them access to 2 &quot;powers&quot;: one activated if they lose the high bid, and another if they win the bid. The powers range from forced card exchanges to card value shifts.&#10;&#10;In 2016 the base game comes bundled with the &quot;Dwarven Kingdom&quot; expansion (PNH0301).&#10;&#10;",

Battle of El Alamein: The first British attack on the German line near El Alamein (15 turns).&#10;    3. Operation Supercharge: The big offensive that brokethrough the German lines and routed the Africa Korps (7 turns).  &#10;&#10;&#10;The components consist of the following: a 'Standard' Rules fold-out 'sheet'(about 3-Full pages) for the game series; an 'Exclusive' Rules sheet(1-page); a 4-COLOR paper Mapsheet-(17&quot; by 22&quot;); a set of cardboard counters(around 120). Players must provide their OWN 6-sided DIE prior to play.&#10;&#10;On the Mapsheet are the Turn Record Track, a Terrain Key, and the set-up locations for the Units of both the 'Campaign' &amp; 'Sidi Rezegh' games. Overall, the COLOR of the Mapsheet is WHITE with BLUE-(Water/Sea, Allied 'Fortified Box', Minefield Hex-sides), BROWN-(Rough), Light GRAY-(Broken), &amp; Dark BROWN-(Roads, Trails). The Area encompassed by this Mapsheet is the coastal road and areas south centered on El Alamein, and Alam Halfa Ridge.&#10;&#10;The game counters are TAN-with BLACK print for Germans, TAN-with GREEN print for Italians, GREEN with BLACK print for British. Game scale is given as 1.7 Miles across each hex, each Turn represents 1-Day, and Units range in size from Battalion up to Brigade level.&#10;&#10;One unique thing of Supercharge is that the supply rules in the standard rules game are ignored completely.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Experience the eye-bending effect of Crystallized! In Crystallized, players will match up colors on the hexagonal cards in their hand with those already played in the play area. Once the color or colors have been matched up, the player will deposit the appropriate number of crystals to the facet board. If a player makes a match with a card that scores more than enough to fill the facet board with that color, they may take the leftover crystals, and dump them on an opponent &ndash; as long as that player has at least one of that color in their collection. They are stuck with those unwanted crystals for the rest of the game.  Don&rsquo;t forget that cards can also be built on top of other cards within the play area, making the game even more complex and challenging. The game is made up of high-quality components that feature a satisfying tactile experience. The beautiful, jewel-colored crystals along with the beautifully designed hexagonal cards make up a gorgeous, abstract play area that&rsquo;s different each time. Crystallized is easy to learn and play, but can be as challenging as each player&rsquo;s mind desires.&#10;&#10;&#10;     THE GOAL IS SIMPLE: Deposit as many crystals as you can to the communal facet board by matching up colors on the hexagonal cards in your hand.&#10;     HOW TO PLAY: Deposit crystals to the facet board by matching colors on a card in your hand with a card already played on the play area. The more colors you match, the more crystals you can add.&#10;     STICK YOUR OPPONENTS: When you fill a facet board, you have the opportunity to stick other players with unwanted crystals.&#10;     END GAME: The game ends when the facet board is full of crystals.&#10;     WIN by having the fewest crystals in your collection at the end of the game.&#10;     EASY TO LEARN, DIFFICULT TO MASTER: Crystallized is easy to learn to play, but can be as challenging as each player would like it to be.&#10;     HIGH QUALITY COMPONENTS: Players will enjoy this beautifully crafted game with highly satisfying tactile elements.&#10;     FUN FOR EVERYONE: Families or Friends: 2-4 players, ages 8-99. Plays in 20 minutes. You will want to play again and again.&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

A continuation of the series of VHS and DVD Nightmare/Atmosfear board games.&#10;&#10;The aim of Atmosfear is to collect a key from each of the six regions of the board before heading to the &quot;Well of Fears&quot; in the centre and attempting to draw your fear from among those of your opponents in order to win the game. This must be done before the clock counts down to zero, or all players lose automatically.&#10;&#10;Like all previous games in the Nightmare/Atmosfear series, Atmosfear makes for stressful play. Players rush to take their turn and pass on the dice as quickly as possible before the Gatekeeper appears and calls on them, and are encouraged to work competitively against each other.&#10;&#10;Atmosfear 2019 uses an App - for apple and android devices - which acts as a timer, constantly ticking away toward the end of the game. It is also a channel for The Gatekeeper, who frequently appears on screen and causes problems for any or all of the players. As in the previous DVD version, the Gatekeeper&rsquo;s appearances are randomised so you cannot predict when he will turn up next or what he&rsquo;ll say. But unlike its predecessor, the game length is also randomised, varying between about 40 and 50 minutes. Where there was only one screen in all the previous versions, the App can run on multiple devices, so the Gatekeeper can sometimes pop on a player&rsquo;s own personal phone.&#10;&#10;",

The game ends during the first half of 1868 when, historically, the Allies broke through the Paraguayan river forts and went on to seize their capital. That advance signaled the ultimate doom of the Paraguayan cause and, though the war officially went on for another year and a half, that portion of it was more a rebellion-and-occupation struggle than an actual war.&#10;&#10;Each hexagon on the map represents approximately 15.5 miles (25 km) from side to opposite side. The ground units of maneuver for both sides are primarily battalions, along with some nominal &quot;brigades&quot; and &quot;divisions,&quot; which are actually all really battalion-equivalents themselves. Each riverine unit represents on naval combat vessel or several armed rafts or transport ships. Game Turn 1 represents three months, while each one after that represents half a year.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "In End of Atlantis: Revised Edition, you and your fellow players become leaders of powerful noble families faced with a prophecy of a certain, impending doom. The stone pillars of fate are falling apart while your carpenters and shipwrights toil ceaselessly building new ships for your people to escape from the mythical island before it is swallowed completely by the hungry ocean &mdash; and yet the senators and political factions still bicker for power, heedless of the tragedy of their nation. It is your sole responsibility to manipulate their decisions for the good of your vassals. You will have to evacuate as many as you can to the New Land using different fantastic vessels, hoping that the Atlaneans will recover and their legacy will endure for millennia to come.&#10;&#10;End of Atlantis: Revised Edition, created by the acclaimed Polish game designer Marcin We&#197;&#130;nicki, is an upgraded and reinvented version of a great and masterfully illustrated game of strategy based on a unique action execution and resource management system. Each player will use various methods to achieve victory: senate factions that provide different abilities, politics cards with different actions, and special cards that change the flow of the game. You should also keep in mind that as the game progresses, global events will unfold - if used to your advantage, they may push you ahead or completely hamper your doings... and that's on top of other players plotting against you!&#10;&#10;In comparison to the first edition of End of Atlantis, some major changes have been made. Firstly, the game is shorter and more dynamic thanks to completely new event cards which now affect the game from the very first round. At the same time, it's also more strategic as you can see future event cards and plan accordingly. Secondly, the mechanism used for choosing senate factions has been simplified and the factions themselves have many new, exciting functions and abilities. Thirdly, many politics cards have wider applications, allowing players to affect the game flow in more profound ways and giving them more flexibility in adjusting to the current in-game situation. Finally, the game and its rules have been generally streamlined and clarified with long card descriptions gone - &quot;End of Atlantis: Revised Edition&quot; is now fully language independent; you just need to master a few intuitive icons and keep on playing!&#10;&#10;Think, scheme and manipulate, and use every trick and tool at your disposal to secure your place among the survivors of the New Land &mdash; and whatever you do, remember that every alliance is easily broken in the face of the apocalyptic disaster that awaits just beyond the horizon!&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "In Bookmaker, players bet on horses in a series of races. They're not concerned about which horse wins, however, so much as making as much money as possible from the bets they place based on which race cards they hold in hand.&#10;&#10;Each turn is divided into two phases: the bidding and the race. During each race two players will be the bookmakers, the ones who set the odds on the four horses. At the start of the race, four race cards from the deck of 80 cards are turned face-up, while each player (including each bookmaker) is dealt four race cards face down. Players look at these cards to determine which cards are out of play &ndash; that is, which horses are less likely to move during the race. The bookmakers secretly exchange two cards each to give them extra information.&#10;&#10;Then the bookmakers individually set odds on the four horses (1:1, 1:2, and so on, with the total of the second numbers adding to at least ten). They reveal these odds to the other players, who must then place at least one bet with one bookmaker. They can place more bets if desired, even with both bookmakers. Each bookmaker records the amount bet and the odds for that horse, and he can then lower the odds on that horse if desired (but if the total of the odds would drop below ten, he must raise the payoff on another horse. Players continue placing bets as long as they want.&#10;&#10;Once all bets are finished, players remove all cards from play, then reveal cards from the top of the deck one-by-one, moving the appropriately colored horse forward one space for each card revealed. Whichever horse reaches the #10 spot on the track first wins. All players who bet on this horse are paid off in the appropriate amount from the bookmakers. During the race, the betters can ask for credit from the bank to spend and win more money &ndash; but of course in the end, they will be forced to pay the money back to the bank with interest!&#10;&#10;After an agreed upon number of races, with each player being bookmaker the same number of times, whoever has the most money wins!&#10;&#10;Variant rules in Bookmaker add wild race cards that move the horse which moved on the previous turn, a bet on which horse is the nag, and a harness option in which horses can break from the track and be disqualified.&#10;&#10;",

After some fighting and hissing Schrodinger finally manages to put the cat into the box and to close it. Happy that the struggle is over he proudly announces that from now on no one is able to know if the cat is dead or alive as long as nobody looks into the box. Schrodinger orders you and your colleagues assistants to watch the box and take notes. An so you do for hours and hours&hellip;&#10;&#10;Finally, you have had enough. You turn towards your fellow colleagues, announcing that you will wager your position of first assistant to whoever is able to make the best guess on whether the cat is already dead and how long ago it died. Enthusiastically, everybody agrees, however you have a plan: to sneak into the laboratory at night and risk a peek into the box to make sure the most suitable candidate gets the title of first assistant. After all, who else would be more suitable than you?&#10;&#10;In Dead Cat you try to guess how long the cat in the box is already dead. When it's your turn you have two options: you can either look into the box or you announce that the cat is dead.&#10;&#10;If you decide to look into the box you take a card from the box deck, look at it without showing it to your opponent and put it on top of the time deck. After that you have to change your bet. Take the your betting die and change it to another site. You choose which one as long as it is not the same as before.&#10;&#10;If you decide to announce the death of the cat the round ends and you start revealing cards from the top of the time deck until you find a dead cat or there are no cards left. In the first case the player with the closest bet to the amount of revealed cards wins the round, in the latter case the player with the highest bet. In case of a tie both player receive a point.&#10;&#10;You play until one player gets 4 points.&#10;&#10;",

Then, you'll like this game!&#10;&#10;Gameplay is based upon 50% strategy and 50% luck of the cards.&#10;&#10;The PEOPLE cards represent your friends and family.&#10;The EVENTS cards represent the good, bad and sometimes ugly things that can (and probably will) happen to you in your lifetime.&#10;&#10;Players score points by declaring a &quot;BEST&quot; FRIEND during their turn (with their PEOPLE cards), playing GAIN cards on themselves during their turn, and trumping LOSE cards with their friends when not their turn.  Trumping can be done with anywhere between 1-5 friends, so long as each friend is essential to the trump.  Scoring is based upon the number of friends used in the trump. (Example, 1-friend trump, gain attributes of 1 friend. 3-friend trump, gain attributes of all 3 friends MINUS the attributes of the LOSE card. 5-friend trump, automatically win the game, but is very rare.)&#10;&#10;Players also have a FAMILY in which they score points at the beginning of the game and then periodically, depending on the number of FAMILY REUNION cards (a type of GAIN card) played. (the narrative of this game perfectly captures the absurdities and truths of life)&#10;&#10;BONUS cards (a type of EVENTS card) help shake-up, speed-up and frustrate gameplay.&#10;&#10;The first person to score 10 points in all 7 attributes:&#10;AUTHENTICITY, CHARISMA, COMFORT, CONFIDENCE, KNOWLEDGE, RESPECT and SECURITY becomes the ultimate People-Person! and wins the game.&#10;&#10;Whether manipulative or wholesome, strategic or just-plain-lucky, People-Person! perfectly captures the relationships that bind us all!&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "The Battle of Gettysburg was fought in July 1, 1863 until July 3rd of the same year. It took place in and around the town of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. &#10;It was the battle with the largest number of casualties in the American Civil War and is often described as the war's turning point.&#10;Union Major General George Gordon Meade's Army of the Potomac defeated attacks by Confederate General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia. This battle put an end to Lee's plans for an invasion of the North.&#10;&#10;Lee vs Meade is a game that covers the Battle of Gettysburg. It was the first game in a series of games put out by Rand known as the 'Command Series Volume I'.  The later version put out by Gamut of Games featured a mounted map-board while the original Rand Games version had a map on heavy paper.&#10;Lee vs. Meade has a 17&quot;X17&quot; map 72 counters(36 for each player) combat charts and turn records charts along with a rulebook.  The scale used is 1/2 mile per square and each unit is considered to be an entire division.  The two-color map is mainly green but there are also some hills and ridges. There is a clearly shown road network of the area as well as terrain that are suitable for defensive outposts.&#10;&#10;The map of the Gettysburg area is broken up into a 12x12 square grid.  This grid system was used in several of the games developed by Rand Game Associates and was called the Time/Space Grid. Movement costs necessary to go from one square to the next are visible on the grid at the edges and corners between the squares making it easier to move without the use of a movement chart. Unlike some games that use a square grid, diagonal movement is permitted.&#10;&#10;Another feature common to most of the games offered by Rand Games was fairly elaborate combat sub-routine in which the attacker and defender would each pick a combat method from a 6x6 matrix called the Tactical Analysis Chart and draw the appropriate &quot;Tac Card.&quot; These &quot;Tac Cards&quot; are numbered from 1 to 6. The cell on the Tactical Analysis Chart that corresponds to the intersection of the two players' combat methods determines which combat results table is used. There are 6 different types of CRT used in this game.&#10;&#10;The turn sequence is easy. Firstly the Confederate army moves.Any combat resulting is resolved and then the Union army moves and any combat is resolved.&#10;In order to initiate a combat you have to move your units onto a square edge that contains enemy units. &#10;There are four different scenarios in the game. A different time of the battle is used in each one and different victory conditions are required for each one.&#10;&#10;",

As a demigod, a player initially has access to 24 heroes from which he can choose his army. With his choice he then faces his opponent(s) on sacred battleground.&#10;&#10;There are different game modes regarding picking heroes (chieftain, random, mirror, free pick mode), and regarding conditions on which victory is achieved (skirmish, tactics). It is the game that relies heavy on tactics, that is fairly simple to learn but hard to master and that has a great replayability.&#10;&#10;In time of Chaos, the God of War was supreme ruler over all other gods. But Time of Peace came, and lasted so long that God of War started to lose his power. He grew weaker as the years went by and was pushed to the side by other gods. When his power faded so much that he felt that the end was near he gave the task to his four sons, the demigods, to try to prove themselves as best commanders in the field of battle. The one who can emerge victorious should become the new God of War and bring back the former glory to their name.&#10;&#10;Gather your heroes, challenge your friends, become the God of War!&#10;&#10;",

Despite the release dates, the board game was actually designed prior to the computer game.&#10;&#10;The turn-based computer game's origin began with fighting mechanics that were meant to have a similar flavor to Avalon Hill's Titan, but the program lacked a story-line and theme. Meanwhile, development of the King's Bounty board game was wrapping up under the working title of &quot;Bounty Hunter.&quot; New World Computing, which owned Task Force Games at the time, decided to have the computer game adopt a storyline and theme similar to that of the board game.&#10;&#10;The computer game, designed by Jon Van Caneghem, is notably considered the forerunner of the Heroes of Might and Magic series of computer and video games. A sequel to the original computer game, called King's Bounty: The Legend, was released in 2008.&#10;&#10;New World Computing transferred ownership of Task Force Games  prior to the production of the board game, which delayed the board game's release. The major remaining component that had to be completed was final production and layout of the rule book, which is why rules artwork changed from that produced for other game components. However, the box cover art, originally contracted and completed for the board game and then adopted by the computer game, remained unchanged upon the board game's release.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Kampf um Rom (Struggle for Rome) is actually two games in one.  Two designers have utilized the same components and come up with two different games.&#10;&#10;Germanica by Hartmut Witt deals with the crumbling of the Roman Empire with the invasion of the German barbarians.  Kind of a cross between Britannia and Civilization, players play a series of tribes that flow through the region.  The aim of the game is to gain the most cultural advances by creating as much stability in a region as possible.&#10;&#10;Huns, Romans, and Germans by Gerhard H. Kuhlmann follows a similar theme although the game is broken down into basic and advanced rules and scenarios.&#10;&#10;The game comes with wood tokens as the playing pieces.  Detailed stickers are applied to the tokens to represent various types of units.  A deck of cards also accompanies the game which drives the invasions and advancements.  Lastly the game board itself is a beautifully painted map of Europe detailed in Latin.&#10;&#10;",

During this period, which ends around 6000 BC, the sea level rises almost 130 meters.&#10;&#10;The goal is to develop your civilization before it is swallowed by the waves. To develop your civilization, you must distribute, collect and share resources with other players. But if the players overexploit the resources and develop too quickly, they impoverish the land, the water will rise and the play area will get smaller. Additionally you can take the competing populations and force them to work as slaves, but you must also work to keep your population from turning into fanatics or becoming enslaved. The players earn points for both how developed their civilization is and how sustainable it is.&#10;&#10;",

The active player tells a story using 1-3 of the item cards he has in hand, then everyone else votes on whether or not he survives.
