Inviting landing pads are everywhere, but the flies only have eyes for the brown feasting pile of &quot;fly candy&quot;. Only the player who plays his cards correctly can quickly move ahead with his flies! But beware! No one is safe from the fly swatter, and some flies may have to return to the starting point just before they reach their final destination.&#10;&#10;User summary:&#10;In Fly Feast, each player tries to move his four flies from the starting space to the destination. The players take turns. Each turn, they first draw a card. This triggers some effect, which may apply a permanent special effect to a space. After drawing the card, the may move one of their flies one or two spaces. The first player to reach the destination with all of his flies wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

The game features a deck of cards consisting of heroes, monsters, weapons and treasure.  Each player starts the game with a party of adventurers (hero cards) on their side (think clerics, fighters, elves, etc.).  During your turn you draw two cards and play two cards, allowing you to perform actions like sending monsters to fight other players, equipping your heroes with weapons, or placing acquired treasure in your personal vault.  A simple combat system is used to resolve monster attacks (which can kill your heroes), and then play passes to the next player.&#10;&#10;Adding some complexity and theme are a number of special ability rules that apply to the different heroes and monsters, such as spells, turning undead,  armor abilities, fiery breath, etc.  When only one player has heroes left standing, that player gets a gold bonus and the round ends.  The cards are collected and a new round begins!  Rinse and repeat until the winning player reaches a certain level of accumulated wealth.&#10;&#10;Re-issued as a CCG with more cards in 1995 under the name Fantasy Adventures.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Another in the line of very small card games by Reinhard Staupe. The deck consists of four suits of cards numbered 1 to 7. The 1s have three stars, the 2s have two stars and all other cards have one star. Players start with 150 points (which serves as a starting score and a money pool for bidding). For 2 players, use 16 cards, for 3 players use 21 cards, for 4 players use 24 cards (so that players do not know which cards are in play) and these are auctioned off one at a time. Bid increments must be at least as great as the number of the card being auctioned but can be more - i.e. while bidding on a card with the number 4, a bid of four would require a bid of 8 or more from the next bidder). The first bid can be lower, the same or higher than the number of the card.  Bidding goes clockwise around the table.  First bid also moves clockwise around the table. When all cards have been auctioned, suits are scored separately for each player by adding the card numbers and multiplying that figure by the total number of stars in the suit. Scores for each suit are added to any remaining points from a players' starting pool (points remaining from the original pool of 150) to determine the final score. Comeback was nominated for Spiel des Jahres in Germany in 1997.&#10;&#10;",

Each card shows a monetary value, along with a number of shares. Reveal cards from the deck until you get one card of each color, and use these cards to set the starting price of the shares for each of the four corporations. Deal each player a hand of eight cards, and give each player $20,000 as starting capital.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you can deal in shares (both buying and selling) and change the value of stocks, but you must do all of your dealing either prior to or subsequent to changing stock values. When you deal, you can sell any number of shares you own, earning money from the bank equal to the number of shares sold by the current value of those shares; when you buy, you can lay down at most two cards from your hand, paying money to the bank equal to the number of shares bought by the current value of those shares.&#10;&#10;When you change value, you take one or two cards from your hand and cover a corporation's current value with this new value; corporations have different limits on how much they can be raised or lowered per card play, with some being more stable than others. If you play the highest-valued cards, you can either pump up the value tremendously &mdash; or tank the stock, bringing its value to $0, with all players discarding all shares they own of this stock. (A player can jumpstart the value of this company by playing a new stock value on it, even with the second card played on the same turn.)&#10;&#10;Alternatively, you can skip the dealing and changing actions to discard 1-4 cards from hand. In either case, to end your turn, replenish your hand to eight cards.&#10;&#10;When the deck is exhausted, take all of the discards and all of the stock value cards other than the top one of each corporation and shuffle them together with a &quot;Market Closed&quot; card to form a new deck. Continue play until the &quot;Market Closed&quot; card is drawn, at which point the game ends immediately, and all shares held by players are cashed out at the current stock value.

Once five or more rows/columns consist of at least two connected cards, you may place a letter only if you extend the length of a row or column to three cards or more.&#10;&#10;If you cannot place a letter card because you can't create a word, then you must remove all cards from the longest row or column and add half of these cards to your hand. (Set the other cards aside as a penalty pile.) If you still can't place a letter in order to create a word, you must remove another word, etc.&#10;&#10;If you place a letter card and connect separate areas of the grid &mdash; which were separated due to someone needing to remove a word &mdash; then you discard one of your penalty cards.&#10;&#10;Typo 2D includes icons on some cards that can be used for variants, such as a card that can replace another card or a card you must place behind an empty spot and &quot;fill in&quot; the empty spot by saying a word.&#10;&#10;",

Of course, players can vaccinate themselves: this hypocrisy costs them -1 point per vaccinate but give them a possibility to ignore the first card of a disease per turn.&#10;&#10;When one player has at least ten influence points the game is played to the end of the round, giving everyone the same number of turns, then the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

But the spinner also tells you if you have to Tip The Waiter.  If you do, you have to reach behind Manuel and flick a lever which extends his arm a short distance.  The more the arm extends, the more unstable the tray of dishes becomes.  Eventually Manuel's arm tips and all the dishes fall off and are given to the person who caused Manuel to drop the dishes.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to get rid of all your dishes first.&#10;&#10;Very similar in theme and name to Don't Tip the Waiter and Don't Tip the Waiter .&#10;&#10;",

Four to six players engage in head-to-head (-to-head-to-head) constant combat until the frenzy peaks and one player emerges victorious.&#10;&#10;Set in an alternate 1920s, an eclectic collection of some of the world&rsquo;s greatest fighters are pitted against each other by the magnanimous Baron Reginald Fistcuffington Smythe aboard his monolithic floating airship. Baron Smythe, inventor of the new super-element Hydrolium, offers the winner of his &quot;Fisticuffs Bouts&quot; the granting of a single wish, whatever their heart desires most. The surviving fighter will get their wish fulfilled - and become champion of Fisticuffs!&#10;&#10;Gameplay is simple. Each player picks a fighter from our cast of characters, each with their own backstory and special move. The stable of fighters include a sky pirate, a flapper, a saxo-magician, the son of a slain Chicago mayor, and a robot built by Baron Smythe himself. Every player gives their fiercest battle cry, and whoever&rsquo;s is best begins the game.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with five cards from the Punch Card deck. These Punches will be a fighter&rsquo;s offense and defense. On a player&rsquo;s turn, they throw a Punch against any opponent - but that player can Block if they are holding a Punch of the same name. This leaves the attacking player open for a Counter, allowing the defending player to attack with a Punch that is the same color as their Block.&#10;&#10;Combat continues until a Punch goes un-Blocked or a Block goes un-Countered. When an attack successfully lands, the defending player loses health. Everybody starts at 12, and when they reach 0, they&rsquo;re knocked out for the rest of the match. Every remaining player gets a turn each round.&#10;&#10;Once a full round (one turn for everybody) has been completed, the fighters return to their corner. This is when you draw new Punch Cards - and when you get a Round Card, a special action that will help provide a tactical advantage by giving you more attacks, depleting an opponent&rsquo;s defenses, or giving you the edge you need in the middle of combat. The new round begins to the left of the person who started the last round.&#10;&#10;The rounds keep going until there are two boxers left, at which point they enter Close Combat - no more rounds, no more Round Cards, just two boxers fighting over one dream. The fighter that is left standing is the winner of the bout and the champion of Fisticuffs!&#10;&#10;",

This punishment is not enacted immediately &mdash; rather, it sits face down in front of you until someone plays a DIG card on you. The DIG card will force you to turn over a scandal and abide by the punishment. Do you risk a scandal, or do you play it safe? The choice is yours in this dirty game of American elections.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Kawa is a game of quiet contemplation for 2 to 4 players, named after the word for river (&#229;&#183;&#157;) in Japanese.&#10;&#10;In Kawa, you guide petals down a river made up of 16 unique tiles. Each round, players will follow the currents and eddies printed on the tiles to send their petals downstream, leaving petals behind as they do.&#10;&#10;As the river comes alive with colour, players must carefully avoid flowing into other players' petals&mdash;when that occurs, those players gain points. This is made all the more challenging as when each player flows, they swap two adjacent river tiles, changing up the river's paths.&#10;&#10;Between each round, the river flows forward, washing away the furthest row of tiles and shuffling them back to the start. Hence, simply following the river's currents is easy - but mastering the game will require players to learn to read its constantly changing flow. After four rounds, the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;Flora and fauna, represented as special tiles, breathe life into the river. Every game, players replace two river tiles with special tiles, each with their own unique effects. These range from a Crab that shuffles up the board by scuttling across the river, to a Shrine that rewards players for spreading their petals across as much as the river as possible. With nine different special tiles of varying complexity to choose from, both casual and hardcore players will find something new to love each foray down the river.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

If the animals matched, they would want to say the opponent's numeric value. The winner gets their opponent's faceup&#10;cards, adds them to his own, and then shuffles them into their draw deck. There is also a slap jack element; there are hand cards that when revealed, cue players to slap the highest-value card showing a mosquito. The winner gets ALL face-up cards.

There are one less dreaded Pirate's Mark cards in the deck than players. Players take turns clockwise making a bluff of how many cards they can pull without getting a Pirate's Mark card increasing their bid by at least one each time. When the bid gets high enough, let's say 17, a fellow pirate may call the bluff.&#10;&#10;Once called, you have to prove your bluff by picking one card at a time from the grid. You can pick whatever card you have your eye one, but must follow the instructions on the cards. Some cards are curses that make the game more treacherous for you while others are a bit of luck. If you pull a Pirate's Mark card, you are out for now but may return later if you successfully call another pirate's bluff. However, if you are successful the player who called your bluff must pull a card themselves as punishment. Bluffing then resumes and gameplay continues until there are only 2 players left or 10 cards at sea. At this point, duel mode is enacted and players pull one card at a time until only one is left un-marked and wins the game!&#10;&#10;This game keeps you on the edge of your seat because the tides can turn at any time.

The last place player also controls the &quot;rogue&quot; bumper car, Jimmy Fudge -- who only wants to bump other players.&#10;&#10;Each player controls one bumper car. Simultaneous movement card play determines the movement order. Players score points for moving around the track in the appropriate direction, and for bumping other bumper cars. Draws are done from a face up draft of n+1 cards where n is the number of players. The remaining card is used to control Jimmy Fudge's bumper car. Play continues until someone has scored 21 points, thereafter, there is an increasing chance of the game ending every turn.&#10;&#10;From the Publisher:&#10;&#10;It's a beautiful day at the amusement park.

For the most part, M&uuml;ckenstich follows traditional trick-taking rules. The active player lays down a card, then each other player follows by playing a single card, following suit, if possible. Whenever a mosquito is played, that player declares one color to be trump. (The game starts with no trump color.) A mosquito or 12 played later in the round is considered higher than one played earlier. Once all players have laid down a card, the highest trump card (if any) wins the trick; with no trump, the highest card in the suit led for the round wins the trick. Players keep track of tricks won, and the winner of a trick leads to the next trick.&#10;&#10;Once all tricks have been played, the single player with the fewest tricks names one suit to count double during scoring, then the single player with the most mosquitoes names one of the three remaining suits to be worthless. Then players tally their points: The first mosquito in a suit is worth -5 points, while all other mosquitos are worth 0. Suited cards are worth 0-2 depending on whether they are worthless, scored as normal, or doubled.&#10;&#10;After a number of rounds equal to the number of players (or twice as many rounds with three players), the player with the highest total score wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Roadkill Rivals is a fast-paced, multi-player card game set in the American Southwest. Players collect cards, sabotage opponents, and compete to create roadkill.&#10;&#10;The deck is made up of three kinds of cards: vehicle cards, animal cards, and roadside cards. Players collect vehicle cards and animal cards. If the combination is right, a player will use a vehicle card to run over an animal card and score points.&#10;&#10;Roadside cards provide an element of randomness. Some affect an individual, and some affect the group. Some are beneficial, and some are punishing. Beware of offramps, rush hour, and the police.&#10;&#10;Lastly, players have the option to sabotage their opponent's strategy by attacking, forcing their opponent to discard. Strong animal cards can kill weaker ones, and large vehicle cars can run smaller ones off the road.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Four Mafia &quot;Families,&quot; controlled by two to four players, vie for control of the island of Sicily. Each Family consists of a Boss and two gangs of young thugs (picciotti).&#10;&#10;The mafioso are opposed by the forces of the Italian State who are controlled by an additional player (except under the four-player rules, where the players share responsibility for moving the State's counters). The State player controls the Prefetto (Prefect), three Carabinieri (military police) units, and a secret-service (SISDE) agent. The State has also established some static roadblocks around the island which can snare careless mafioso. Through their combined efforts, the forces of the State seek to arrest as many Bosses and picciotti as they can.&#10;&#10;Two decks of cards are used to reflect events stemming from the influence of mafia allies in the United States and support for the Prefetto from the Italian continent. A third card deck represents the evidence the secret-service agent can gather to establish grounds for the Prefetto to arrest Bosses.&#10;&#10;But the justice system is weak. Detainees and arrestees will be released without warning. Shootouts erupt across the island. Innocent diners can face repeated attacks at their favorite ristorante. The violence is unending, with ambushes and assassinations seeming to be as common as the leaves on the olive trees. However, there is no player-elimination element, or even permanent elimination of units. Replacements will always arrive from the continent, although that will take a variable amount of time.&#10;&#10;The playing board is a track of 26 loosely-defined spaces running around the perimeter of the island of Sicily, and through the center, in a sort of a B-shaped pattern. The board includes three significant Sicilian cities (Palermo, Catania, and Enna) which can serve as headquarters for the Mafia Families. Units move by a roll of the dice in a clockwise fashion, using the combined total of the dice to move one unit, or the individual numbers shown on the dice to move two units.&#10;&#10;The Families are in a race to be the first to control four spaces on the board, but the State can prevail if it imprisons enough Bosses and picciotti to remediate the plague of criminal violence.&#10;&#10;Mafia is a straightforward game with an unusual setting. It aroused some discussion in Italian newspapers when it first came out. The game approaches its deadly serious subject with a sarcastic tone, and somewhat sanitized violence, for a strategic and thematic gaming experience.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Lost in Time is a thematic game centering around time travel with three sets of rules that allow for different ways of play. The game consists of 88 cards with beautiful historical illustrations.&#10;&#10;The first version of the game is light and easy, specifically designed for children ages 10 and up. It's the year 2031: you are one of the very first time travelers and you have been sent to the past. However, your time machine does not work as it was supposed to (isn't that typical!) and you are left stranded in the past. Now you have to get back to the year 2031. The player who is the closest to the year 2031 after the eighth leap wins! Each game round the players must place a card on their timeline but the problem is: not everybody will want to travel to the future like you do, some will want to jump to the past. And if you can't place anything on your timeline, you run the risk of being absorbed by the vortex. It's a tug-of-war in time &amp; space. Duration of play: 20 to 30 minutes.&#10;&#10;The second version, The Time Bandits, is semi-cooperative and lets the players choose between being the secret agents or the thieves. The thieves, sent to the past by a criminal organization, must collect four historical artifacts before the eighth card has been played &mdash; without being caught by the agents. These agents have been hired &amp; vigourously trained by the government to hunt the criminals down throughout the centuries before they end up changing the past and thus also automatically...the future. All players receive a deck of 18 cards which represent their time machine's battery allowing them to conjure up a wormhole in order to jump into time. The players must keep a close eye on the level of their battery: if it's empty, they will not be able to jump in time anymore and they will end up Lost in Time. In this version, the players are allowed to take items with them in their backpack to help save their skin if they end up in a historical disaster (Battle of the Somme or Eruption of the Vesuvius...). Both the agents and thieves can also make use of famous historical characters (Elizabeth I, Napoleon or Lenin...) to help them stop their rivals! If a players ends up in a period within the influence of a historical character who is allied to his rival, he will be in serious trouble! Duration of play: 30 to 40 minutes.&#10;&#10;The third version is a solo variant. An attack has been made on your lab, and you've managed to escape in the &quot;nick of time&quot; by opening up a vortex and jumping in. You are a lonesome chrononaut with only one objective: get back to the year 2031 and prevent the attack on the lab. Before traveling to the past, you must decide how many batteries (deck of cards) to bring along. Every leap in time costs an amount of energy and even moreso if you end up in a period of disaster. When your batteries are empty, you are stuck in time, so you must be economical with your available energy! Will you jump in time immediately and save your battery, or will you press your luck and spend more energy in order to find a data chip that will help your travel through time more easily? Duration of play: 15 to 20 minutes.&#10;&#10;Can you survive the past?&#10;&#10;",

For putting, if the number rolled on the putting column is greater than or equal to the distance left to the pin, the putt is good.  Otherwise, unless the putt is badly missed (which checks another &quot;Second Putt Card&quot; to determine the length of the next putt), the second putt is assumed to always good.&#10;&#10;Record the score for the hole.

    "description": "Players advance around a board by choosing one of four questions on a card and moving forward based on the number or color that answers the question. The cards come in three types. With the 'color' type, each of the four colors of board squares will be one of the answers, and the player will move his playing piece to the nearest colored space that corresponds to his answer. On the 'list' and 'number' cards, '0', '1', '2', and '3' will be the answers, and the player will move his playing piece forward the number of squares corresponding to the answer.&#10;&#10;Each piece also comes with a character card, and that character's special move may be made once during the game.&#10;&#10;",
