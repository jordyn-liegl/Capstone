The game maps stretch from Vierville to St. Laurent and provide every draw, house, and German Stuetzpunkt (Strong Point).&#10;&#10;The map takes the American landing from Dog Green to Easy Green, with the Dog White and Dog Red landing beaches in between. As for depth, you will be battling almost a mile inland before the ATS gamer can consider his lodgment in Normandy secure. German players will have something to say about all this as they attempt to coordinate fire from Strong Points Wn71 through Wn66.&#10;&#10;A complete beach-landing presentation is provided, taking ATS gamers personally through a historical experience akin to the first 20-minutes of the seminal film Saving Private Ryan with the difference being their personal attachment to involvement in the action. Will your leaders rally your men off the beach?&#10;&#10;In keeping with the ATS approach you will receive a stack of small, fast-playing scenarios to get you on that gorgeous map right away. But this is also a monster game that will include a super-sized supply of counters, all you need to play a giant, full-map scenario!&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Olympus is shaking to its foundations. Faith among the mortals is waning and with it the very power of the pantheon. Zeus is in a rage: &quot;Hear me, gods! I command you to send forth my MONSTROUS pets. Make them rain from the sky and erupt from the underworld. We will rekindle these mortals' faith - through FEAR!&quot;&#10;&#10;Monstrous is a game of gods and monsters, fear and faith, dexterous skills and tactical combos.&#10;&#10;Players are Greek gods throwing mythical monster cards from their hand onto a shared tableau of ancient Greek locations to gain as much 'Faith' as possible. But a strong guiding hand is not enough - cunning use of tactical monster and location powers is the key to gaining the most faith of all the gods, and the favor of Zeus.&#10;&#10;During setup, a number of large location cards equal to the number of gods are arranged on the table - these are selected from 12 ancient Greek cities where the insolent humans cower. Locations have special powers and provide Faith when hit by Monsters. Depending on the number of gods playing, each god has a randomly constructed deck of between 7 and 10 out of 12 mythical monster cards, each with their own special power. Each god shuffles and readies these decks, then draws 3 of their monster cards ready to throw at locations and monsters already on the table.&#10;&#10;On their turn, a god chooses a single monster from their hand, and throws it (without their hand crossing the table edge) attempting to hit:&#10;1. a location - to use its special power, and any thrown monster power that affect locations, and gain its Faith.&#10;2. other monster cards on the table - to use the special power of their thrown monster on the other gods&rsquo; monsters. &#10;3. ideally both at the same time!&#10;&#10;Look for the best cards to throw and the best targets to throw at. But beware: monsters may do unpredictable and dangerous things. Some monsters even act like traps on the table, taking effect as soon as they are hit. If Olympus is in play, powerful legendary monsters can be gained for gods to throw too.&#10;&#10;Once a god has finished their turn, they draw a new monster and play proceeds to the next god. This proceeds until one god runs out of monster cards completely. Each other god then takes 1 final turn before the god with the highest Faith is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;Monstrous blends stunning art of mythic Greece with quick card throwing, fist pumping action and the tactical combos that gods and gamers love. Every game is different and there are optional rules to tailor your MONSTROUS experience for children, team play and longer games with legendary monsters.&#10;&#10;And yes, you can release the Kraken.&#10;&#10;",

Interest is added to the board by a river (navigable only by the rat, but the lion and tiger can leap across it) and pitfalls (which make all animals vulnerable to attack by weaker ones). Sets can be bought cheaply in many Chinese shops; some have rules in English. This is not a deep intellectual exercise, but a strategic game that can be enjoyed even by young children.&#10;&#10;",

That said, many different paths can be experienced during play, with more than one correct resolution to the story waiting to be discovered. Each title consists of three chapters, each taking about 75 minutes to play. Nothing is destroyed, so the games can be played multiple times.&#10;&#10;In Adventure Games: Die drei ??? &ndash; Das Geheimnis der Statue, dive deep into an exciting and mysterious adventure with Rocky Beach detectives Justus Jonas, Peter Shaw and Bob Andrews.

    "description": "[From the back cover...]&#10;&#10;VICTORY AT WATERLOO is a deceptively simple game covering that epic encounter between Napoleon and Wellington on 18th June, 1815. The onus is on the French player to defeat Wellington's army before the Prussians can have a definite influence on the outcome of the battle.&#10;&#10;The counter mix includes Infantry, Artillery and Cavalry for thre three armies involved: French, British and Prussian. Although the rules are simple the game can be played again and again -- usually turning out the be a cliff-hanger every time! Optional rules cover command control, the Old Guard and the strengths of artillery and cavalry.&#10;&#10;The game is suitable for beginner to the hobby of board wargaming, the rules being easy to learn and containing numerous examples of play.&#10;&#10;Components: 16&quot; x 23.5&quot; full color, mounted map board in two pieces, 100 die-cut counters, rules booklet and one six-sided die.&#10;&#10;",

Each player in this game is a businessman who has the opportunity of buying machines and raw materials, selling his products, paying taxes, raising loans or introducing rationalization schemes, and generally experiencing the ups and downs of everyday business life.&#10;&#10;Before starting, players agree the duration of the game. The player with the greatest net assets at the end of the game is the winner.&#10;&#10;The board comprises a circuit of 42 spaces of 5 different types: decision spaces on which the player can choose to buy raw material, purchase capital equipment, manufacture goods or sell goods, research &amp; development spaces which allow investment for productivity improvement or risk reduction, risk spaces which require the drawing of a risk card, additional cost spaces, and depreciation spaces.&#10;&#10;Each player has a factory card on which are placed machines, computers, raw materials and finished goods. At the start of the game, priced slots in the center of the board are filled with the goods: these slots are emptied and filled as goods are bought as raw material and sold as finished goods. The buying and selling price is determined by the next available filled or empty slots, though players can bid competitively for the purchase or sale.&#10;&#10;The Economy Game uses the basic mechanism and many features.&#10;&#10;",

The gardener must try to block the mole's moves and fence him in quickly, while the mole must dig as many holes as possible before being caught.&#10;&#10;Essentially, the mole may move any direction, horizontally or diagonally from square to square, while the gardener places boundary sticks down along the edges of the square, which the mole may not cross.  The mole and gardener may either move or place down a boundary stick, and move alternately.  Eventually, the gardener will hem the mole in completely and the round is over.  In addition, if the mole can move into flower beds, extra points are scored.  By moving to the center, the mole may also tunnel deeply to any selected square on the board, thus escaping the (by then) rapidly closing trap of boundary sticks.  Depending on how many moves this took, more or less points are earned by the mole.&#10;&#10;Once points are totaled up, the roles are reversed and another round is played.  The winner is the player who scored the most points as the mole.&#10;&#10;",

One player controls the Communists, the other the Free World Forces. Each game turn equals one week, and each hexagon represents 25 miles. The units of maneuver for both sides range from battalions up through regiments, brigades and full divisions. The game includes one full-size (34x22&quot;) large-hex map and 280 half-inch, NATO-style, counters. All of South Vietnam, plus the border regions of Cambodia, Laos and North Vietnam are on the map, and the orders of battle include all the units of both sides that participated historically.&#10;&#10;There are two scenarios: one short, with only five game turns in the autumn of 1965, and the other long, covering the entire period of the early American war with a full 20 game turns. The rules contain approximately 16,000 words, which works out to two experienced players being able to get through the campaign game in one long session of about six to eight hours.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Yomi is a fighting game in card form in which physical dexterity is replaced by hand management skills. Just like in a fighting game, you have to know your character, know the matchup, and know your opponent. Each character has a deck that follows the same conventions as deck of playing cards. This makes it easy to learn the contents of your deck: numbered cards are normal moves, face cards are special moves, and aces are super moves.&#10;&#10;More specifically, Yomi is a competitive card game specifically designed and balanced to hold up to tournament play with many years of playtesting and tournaments behind it. It tests the skills of valuation and Yomi. Valuation refers to your ability to judge the relative value of moves (or cards) as they change over the course of the game. Yomi, the game's title, refers to your ability to &quot;read&quot; the patterns that your opponent unconsciously falls into. It's designed for high level play to be as interesting as possible and as balanced as possible.&#10;&#10;Yomi Starter Set: Grave versus Jaina features two character decks, allowing players to face off immediately. Individual character decks allow new matches to be fought between different pairings.&#10;&#10;Game Modes&#10;&#10;     1v1, the main mode&#10;     2v2 Team Battle, inspired by video games such as Marvel vs Capcom&#10;     A solo mode to learn basic proficiency against an automated opponent&#10;     A 3v3 mode (can be played as 1v1 with multiple characters) inspired by video games such as King of Fighters&#10;&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;&#10;     Each player shuffles their deck and draws an opening hand of seven cards.&#10;     Turns are simultaneous and players draw one card per turn.&#10;     Each player plays a combat card face down, then reveals the cards simultaneously.&#10;     Resolve combat. Blocking an attack lets you draw a card; hitting with an attack or throw allows you to combo more cards from your hand; dodging an attack lets you hit back with a single move.&#10;     Bluff phase. After it's resolved who won combat, but before any combos are played, the player who might get hit by a combo can play a facedown Joker or bluff card. After the attacker finishes their combo, reveal that facedown card. If it's a Joker, the combo does no damage. If it's a non-Joker card, the combo does full damage as usual.&#10;     Power up: Players can discard pairs, 3-of-a-kinds, or 4-of-a-kinds to search their decks for Aces (super moves). Also, if they performed any chain combos (straights of sequential normal attacks, such as a 2,3,4,5) that turn, they can also search for Aces.&#10;&#10;&#10;The game ends when one player is reduced to 0 life, or when one player draws the last card of their deck. In that case, time is out and the player with the highest life wins.&#10;&#10;Note Contained in:&#10;Yomi (Second Edition)&#10;Yomi: Round 1&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Quatre Bras&#10;Stalemate on the Brussels Road&#10;&#10;The crossroads of Quatre-Bras was of strategic importance because the side which controlled it could move south-eastward along the Nivelles-Namur road towards the French and Prussian armies at the Battle of Ligny. If Wellington's Anglo-Allied army could combine with the Prussians, the combined force would be larger than Napoleon's. Napoleon's strategy had been to cross the border into the Netherlands without alerting the Coalition and drive a wedge between their forces and subsequently to defeat the Prussians before turning on the Anglo-Allied army. Although the coalition commanders did have an overview of French pre-war movements, Napoleon's strategy was initially very successful.&#10;&#10;The battle cost Ney 4,000 men to Wellington's 4,800. Although a tactical draw, the allies had been unable to send forces to the aid of the Prussians at the Battle of Ligny. Wellington's Anglo-Allied army, upon learning of the Prussian defeat, was forced to retreat north along the Brussels road further away from the Prussians, who retreated north-east towards Wavre.&#10;&#10;There has been much debate of what would have happened if d'Erlon's I Corps had engaged at either Ligny or Quatre Bras. As he did not, Napoleon chose to follow Wellington with the bulk of his forces, and two days later met his destiny at Waterloo.&#10;&#10;Quatre Bras is part of the Napoleon's Last Battles Quadrigame.  It was also sold separately as a folio game.&#10;&#10;Folio version includes rules, a 17&quot; x 22&quot; map and 100 counters.&#10;&#10;",

The objective is to connect five (or more) of one's tiles, including at least one of each type, together (sides and corners count).

It&rsquo;s simple enough to learn in 3 minutes, yet deep enough where you are discovering new strategies every time you play it. But best of all, it&rsquo;s always your turn.&#10;&#10;Players start with a hand of 6 bids. Bids are valued 1 - 5 with the lower valued cards containing some game changing actions. Players chose a bid and place it face down in the ready position. When everyone is ready the bids are simultaneously revealed. The bids&rsquo; colors signify what you are bidding on. Red bids recruit gangsters with unique abilities, green bids buy various types of Contraband (worth victory points), and blue bids bribe the Cop, which protects your points and forces the competition to lose theirs. After 3 rounds the highest bidder for a given color wins the corresponding prize. Players take their winnings and reset the board for the next hand.&#10;&#10;Player interaction comes from the actions on the lower numbered bid cards. Actions allow you to steal your rivals contraband, assassinate their mercenaries, and put the odds in your favor.&#10;&#10;Each gangster has their own unique ability that is active throughout the entire game. Depending on which gangsters you recruit, different strategies will become available. For example, the Mob Boss gives you an additional Victory Point for each Gangster on your team, this card pairs well with the Recruiter who gives you a permanent +2 to your red bid total. This combination helps you outbid your opponents for new gangsters and earn you victory points when you do so.&#10;&#10;The game ends after 12 rounds of bidding. The player with the most victory points wins.&#10;&#10;",

As a player, you must command your German or Allied forces so as to capture the objectives on the board while keeping your casualties down (and your opponent&rsquo;s casualties high).&#10; Using a fresh take on the venerable wargaming system presented in the D-Day and Market-Garden series, Battle of the Bulge authority and game developer Randy Heller has brought Paul&rsquo;s system up in scale to handle the larger operations in this campaign and provides the great (but manageable!) gaming &ldquo;chrome&rdquo; that wargamers so enjoy when exploring history using a &ldquo;paper time machine&rdquo; like Paul Koenig&rsquo;s The Bulge: 6th Panzer Army.&#10;&#10;Game Data:&#10;&#10;Complexity: 4 on a 9 scale&#10;Solitaire Suitability: 7.5 on a 9 scale&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "&ldquo;Punic Island&rdquo; is the third volume in the Campaign Commander series and simulates the campaign for Sicily and North Africa during the First Punic War. The system takes away from Second World War and goes to Ancients. In 264 Roma was summoned to Messina by Mamertines mercenaries to help in their quarrel with Cartage, the main power in Sicily. Carthaginians count on Hiero the Tirant of Syracuse to help defeating the Mamertines. Here begins the First Punic War.&#10;Romans and Carthaginians fought for 22 year over Sicily and in North Africa. Rome emerged victorious and Cartage was obliged to quit his long standing presence in Sicily.&#10;The land campaign was a long string of Roman victories as city after city was subdued and every Carthaginian army was defeated in battle. Syracuse was forced to make an alliance with Rome and Cartage was left with only a few fortresses in the island.&#10;Anyway the war was won and lost in the sea. The war saw the emergence of Rome as a sea-power and a long string of naval victories allow Roman troops to menace even Cartage proper. Only to be saved by Xantipus and his mercenary army at the Bagradas Plains battle. Naval warfare played a prominent role in this war and will give Carthage Senate his las blow. Carthage tried to spend the Roman effort during the whole war. His strategy was of attrition and was unsuccessful; Rome never gave up a prize.&#10;The game is developed in an operational scale &ndash; area-based map. It is designed for two players with one running the ROMAN forces and the other the CARTHAGINIAN forces -including Syracuse. The game lasts approximately 3-4 hours and uses a two sided system to handle the mechanics of play: cards and counters. The players will have to use their troops and their resources to obtain victory points while eliminating enemy forces and occupying cities in the map. It is not a card driven game as the cards are used to bring about events that influence battles, secure reinforcements, and provide resources with which to carry on the fight.&#10;The ROMAN player will be on the offensive during the whole game as he has to conquer the whole island to get victory. CARTHAGINIAN player focuses on spoiling Roman campaigns and plans with ambushes, sallies and bad weather cards. Also he has to recruit an army as he doesn&acute;t has any at the beginning of the game.&#10;The ROMAN player must plan his offensives carefully as he will need a new army and resources for each one. Also he will need to build a fleet his doesn&acute;t have at the start of the war. The sea contest will be evenly match and you better take into account bad weather as it sinks more ships than enemy action.&#10;Siege warfare takes a prominent role in this game as every city in the game map is a walled on with his own intrinsic garrison.&#10;Like all the games of this Series, the rules are simple and straight forward. Our objective was to create games that are very interactive, and offer players a pleasant creative experience. We aim for solid games for players who do not have the time or the space to leave a game setup and in place over a long period of play.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;- 1 80x60 cm map of Sicily and North Africa.&#10;- two ten-sided dice&#10;- 176 unit counters&#10;- 1 Rules Book for the Series &ldquo;Campaign Commander&rdquo; and Exclusive Rules of &ldquo;Punic Island&rdquo;; historical and designer notes.&#10;- 70 cards (divided in two decks, plus help cards)&#10;- 3 plastic bags.&#10;&#10;",

These goals apply to both players while the card is in the central area, with fulfilled goals remaining in play.&#10;&#10;Cards can be discarded for their special ability, played to the player&rsquo;s team to fulfill goals using its suit and value, or as a new shared goal.&#10;&#10;At the end of the round, players count their current star value.

At the end of the dungeon season, score renown from sets of monsters collected and for in-fashion style symbols in your final outfit. Most renown wins!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "[From the back of the Avalon Hill game box]&#10;&#10;They were a part of Europe's &ldquo;next Generation&rdquo;, asked to march to war before they had tasted of life's joys and sorrows.&#10;&#10;They were cut from a special cloth, singled out to do a job that demanded intelligence, endurance, steadiness and coordination of the highest order.&#10;&#10;They dueled to the death in fragile machines, only just invented ten years before, miles above the earth.&#10;&#10;They were brave soldiers to their comrades in arms and heroes to their public.&#10;&#10;They were the fighter pilots of the Great War &ndash; THE KNIGHTS OF THE AIR.&#10;&#10;Avalon Hill's game, KNIGHTS OF THE AIR, recreates the deadly combat of the World War I air war.  You learn to fly the great airplanes of the period much in the same way the Aces did &ndash; rig in the cockpit using control stick, throttle and rudder pedals.  Each kind of warplane included in the game has been carefully researched to present the same strengths, weaknesses and idiosyncrasies it demonstrated in real life.  Once you have learned the tricks of your aircraft, you can dare to risk all in a dogfight.  Air combat is conducted in a series of maneuvers as each pilot tries to position his plane for the killing run.  With experience, new and more complicated maneuvers become available so that the ace can barrel roll and loop rings around the novice.  Your success will depend upon your ability to master your plane and to exploit the weaknesses of your enemy's.&#10;&#10;Some Features:&#10;- Your Abilities to improve with experience, An Ace can react quicker, aim his gunfire more accurately, and undertake more complicated maneuvers than a novice can.&#10;&#10;- Each kind of airplane in the game has been designed to perform just like its real-life counterpart.  Rates of climb and dive, maximum and stall speeds, and turning abilities all compare favorably with test flight results.&#10;&#10;-You guide your airplane on the gameboard using real controls.  You adjust speed with the control stick and the rates of dive and climb with the throttle.&#10;&#10;- Special attention was directed, during the design, to develop a simple method of allowing one plane to tail another.  The reflexes of both airplane and pilot are a crucial factor in this procedure.&#10;&#10;- With the wide choice of airplanes included, a practically unlimited variety of dogfights may be staged.  Many of the greatest warplanes are there the Sopwith Camel, SE 5a, SPAD, Nieuport, Bristol Fighter, Fokker Triplane, Fokker DVII, Albatros, Pfalz, Roland and more.&#10;&#10;- Special solitaire scenarios have been created to restage attacks against Zeppelin airships and two-seater warplanes.&#10;&#10;Complexity: Medium&#10;Solitaire Suitability: High&#10;&#10;Each game contains:&#10;- A 22&rdquo;x32&rdquo; full-color gameboard depicting a section of trenchline on the Western Front.  Actual battlefield photographs were consulted during the construction.&#10;- Hundreds f die-cut playing pieces representing all of the airplanes and various markers needed for record-keeping.&#10;- Six sets of maneuver cards.  Each card contains a diagram of a specific maneuver just as it was actually flown.&#10;- A set of Airplane Performance Cards.  A different card has been prepared for each airplane.&#10;- Three six-sided dice&#10;&#10;",

The action is fast and realistic; the system is easy-to-learn.&#10;&#10;In War Stories you are the commander issuing orders to infantry squads and armored fighting vehicles. Each game presents a scenario using a map with terrain overlays that regulates movement and impacts combat in a unique system that does not require charts or endless modifiers. Players receive a secret set of instructions with hidden deployment and objectives. Unit blocks have a variety of information that regulates their ability to move, fight and remain cool under fire.&#10;&#10;War Stories also offers &quot;rule breaking&quot; asset and event cards. These enable War Stories to have additional complexity with minimal rules weight: the rules and effects are on the cards themselves. Assets are special equipment, troops, and abilities that a player has access to during the battle, such as machine guns, infiltration units, and the ability to lay mines. Events are random things that happen and create memorable moments on the battlefield such as reinforcements arriving, a gust of wind that starts a wildfire, or a damaged vehicle suddenly brewing up.&#10;&#10;ages 14+&#10;1-2 players&#10;(Note: there is no solitaire system; it is a normal 2-player wargame, but the publisher printed &quot;1-2 players&quot; on the box)&#10;60 minutes&#10;&#10;GAME COMPONENTS:&#10;- 5 double-sided mapboards&#10;- 23 double-sided terrain overlays&#10;- 75 painted wooden blocks &amp; stickers to represent vehicles &amp; infantry&#10;- 109 counters (vehicle damage, battlefield damage, fog of war, unit, order and ambush markers)&#10;- 33 asset cards&#10;- 21 event cards&#10;- 24 combat chips and 1 cloth drawbag&#10;- 2 16-page scenario booklets (one German and one Soviet)&#10;- 2 player screens/aids&#10;- 1 20-page rule book&#10;&#10;Also see the sister game released at the same time: War Stories: Liberty Road, set on the Western front.&#10;&#10;",

By cleverly flipping and rotating the path tiles they have to build new roads through the jungle, track down rare animals and load them onto their ships, which circle around the island.&#10;&#10;Like the vegetation in a jungle the board of Expedition Sumatra is constantly changing its appearance - old paths vanish, new ones appear, while the players are searching for animals hidden in the forest. And each tile that is flipped raises the question anew: Will the hunt be successful or will there be only deserted paths or might there even be a native lurking, ready to take the hard-won animals back to the jungle?&#10;&#10;---&#10;&#10;Sumatra - Insel vieler seltener Tierarten&#10;&#10;Im Auftrag namhafter Zoologischer G&auml;rten machen sich mehrere Teams von Gro&szlig;wildj&auml;gern daran, zum Nutzen der Nachwelt einige der selten gewordenen Tiere im Dschungel von Sumatra einzufangen. Zwar lockt auch der Schwarzmarkt mit guten Preisen, doch die Inselbewohner haben ebenfalls noch ein W&ouml;rtchen mitzureden.&#10;&#10;Expedition Sumatra f&uuml;hrt die Spieler in einen &uuml;ppig wuchernden Inselurwald. Hier gilt es, durch geschicktes Klappen und Drehen der Wegepl&auml;ttchen Pfade durchs Dickicht zu bahnen, seltene Tiere zu entdecken und auf das eigene Schiff, das die Insel umkreist, zu verladen.&#10;&#10;Wie die Vegetation eines Urwalds ver&auml;ndert sich bei Expedition Sumatra best&auml;ndig der Spielplan - alte Wege verschwinden, neue entstehen, w&auml;hrend die Spieler auf der Suche nach im Dschungel versteckten Tieren die gr&uuml;ne Wildnis durchk&auml;mmen. Bei jedem Klappen eines Wegepl&auml;ttchens stellt sich erneut die Frage, was sich darunter verbirgt - wird einem das Jagdgl&uuml;ck hold sein, st&ouml;&szlig;t man nur auf verlassene Pfade oder lauert einem gar ein Eingeborener auf, der wom&ouml;glich die m&uuml;hsam gefangenen Tiere wieder zur&uuml;ck in den Urwald bringen will?&#10;&#10;",

The objective of the game is to win from your opponent by enclosing the opponents pieces and thus removing them from the board. Coerceo has only a few basic game rules that can be mastered in just a couple of minutes.&#10;&#10;The Coerceo board consists of 19 board tiles, each tile having 6 sides (hexagonal shape). A tile has 6 alternating black and white triangles marked on them. The 19 board tiles placed against each other make up the Coerceo modular game board. Each player starts with 18 identical game pieces which represent them on the board. Each game piece is a tetrahedron (i.e. shaped like a three sided &lsquo;pyramid&rsquo;). All game pieces have the same playing capabilities, which are moving and enclosing pieces from the opponent.&#10;&#10;The Coerceo board gets smaller during the game when tiles are taken away from the board. This means that the opponent is never far away.&#10;&#10;",

Its Great and Lesser Houses rise and fall with the whims of its Family Royal, the Sovereign House Kythid&ucirc;hr. Amidst the festivals of summer, House Kythid&ucirc;hr announced its intent to elevate one of D&ucirc;hr&rsquo;s Lesser Houses to Great House status. By autumn&rsquo;s frosts, the Lesser Houses were deeply embroiled in a fierce battle for the coveted title. Not with soldiers, for that would waste blood and gold, but with the most insidious of political weapons: suspicion and scandal. They attacked each other with aspersions and calumny, well devised and craftily exploited, designed to erode the social standing of their rival Houses and thereby remove them from contention.&#10;&#10;D&ucirc;hr: The Lesser Houses accommodates 4 to 6 players. Each player is the master of a Lesser House of D&ucirc;hr, vying for Great House status. Players take turns using cards in their hand to trigger events, place suspicions and scandals on each other&rsquo;s House, or activate their own House&rsquo;s unique ability to affect cards already placed. The accumulation of suspicion and scandal cards on a House card erodes the populace&rsquo;s favor for that House by raising suggestions of wrongdoing or embroiling it in scandals that incite public outrage.&#10;&#10;All Houses begin the game without any suspicions or scandals and favored by the people of D&ucirc;hr. When a House accumulates a combined total of 5 suspicion and/or scandal cards, that House falls into disfavor with the populace. If a disfavored House ever has 3 or more revealed scandal cards, the House becomes vilified. The game ends immediately when the number of favored Houses remaining is 1 or none. Whoever has the highest score at that point wins the game. It is possible for a disfavored or vilified House to outscore a favored House and win the game!&#10;&#10;Pronunciation note: pronounce &quot;&ucirc;&quot; in &quot;D&ucirc;hr&quot; like the &quot;oo&quot; in &quot;doom.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

In addition, after comparing the production of all players, whoever has used the most of each resource type is fined for pollution. To make things interesting, you have the option of turning your production cards face down, so that they won't be counted as pollution. Though this action requires valuable turns to accomplish, all of the companies might use plenty of effort to mitigate their pollution!&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, the player who produces the most energy, while dodging production fines through clever card play, wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Everything Lost is a thematic solo game set in an apocalyptic world in which you are the hero.&#10;&#10;One day, you wake up. Like always, the first thing you do is open your curtains to look outside......to find out this day is different. You are stunned. Everything is lost. Your town is destroyed. Roads are gone, rubble is everywhere. Most buildings which are still standing look like skeletons. A few people are out there, stumbling goalless between the chaos, like... zombies.&#10;&#10;What is this? What happened? For how long have you been sleeping? You open your fridge. The smell! You close it fast. You feel a cold breeze. You look up. You notice almost half of your roof is missing. You&rsquo;re shaking. It&rsquo;s freezing. You start to feel a primal drift. You realize no one is here to help you. You have got to take care of things. Danger is out there. Instinctively you grab a tool from your toolbox and go outside.&#10;&#10;A game of Everything Lost consists of 4 chapters. In every chapter you choose 1 (out of 2 or 3) missions to play. Each mission starts at your home, the centre of town. You explore the 4 sectors surrounding your home. When you survive all 4 missions, you win. Search for food, repair your roof, steal a bulldozer and ram a warehouse, save survivors from a mall, eliminate a gang of outlaws, etc.&#10;&#10;Next time you may follow a different path, by choosing different missions.&#10;&#10;On your map you draw the city with your pencil as the game progresses. Your 5 white dice represent your energy. Use them well. If you spend a lot of dice, your chances will increase, but you will run out of dice fast. When you do, you will need to rest to get them back. This is risky. The mob will grow and events will force you to make difficult choices.&#10;&#10;Break in buildings to find useful things and weapons, search the rubble, fight zombies and look for  survivors. Convince them to join your team. Get more experienced and unlock new skills and actions. Eventually you will craft new weapons, climb buildings and attack the mob from above, or ambush them. Who&rsquo;s the boss now? But only if you are a real survivor. Will you earn yourself one of the 4 available nicknames? Good luck!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "MedFront details the conflict between the Allies and Germany during WWII from 1940-43, as well as the Spanish Civil War from 1936-39. Players have to contend with production, supply, command control and the weather to break the other side's lines and achieve victory.  The game comes with a fantastic detailed map of Spain and North Africa printed on card and many wooden blocks for the units. This is just one portion of the complete EuroFront series, which covers the entire European conflict of WWII.&#10;&#10;This title uses Columbia Games Block system.  While there are variations in the rule sets, all of their games are based on the block system.  Basically this means that rather than using the traditional  counters to represent units on the map the game uses wooden blocks that stand upright with unit details only shown on one side.  This does two things:  First it provides an easy way of producing a &quot;fog of war&quot; because your opponent can not tell, save through good memory, what type of unit a specific piece is or its current strength.  Second, having the blocks stand on end allows the possibility of rotating a block so the current strength is the top number.  Although most war games have some type of mechanism that lets units take steps in their overall strength, counters normally have at most two steps because they only have two sides.  Blocks, however, have four so you can easily keep track of twice the amount of detail that many other war games provide.  With the use of blocks Columbia has provided a way of adding a good deal of depth to their war games without adding complex layers of bookkeeping, allowing interesting and relatively short sessions of play.&#10;&#10;WestFront II: The War in Europe 1943-45 &#226;&#128;&#147; Second Edition includes updated MedFront maps and some Spanish units; EuroFront: The War in Europe, 1936-45 &#226;&#128;&#147; Second Edition has the updated MedFront rules (and the Spanish Civil War scenario and other Spanish units) for those maps.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    EuroFront: War in Europe, 1939-45&#10;&#10;&#10;",

This release ties into Grand Europa by providing state-of-the-art Order of Battle information on Swedish, Norwegian, and Danish armed forces from 1939 to 1945 and German Northern Theater armed forces from 1940 to 1943.&#10;&#10;Europa IV game.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;    Narvik rules and orders of battle (20 pages)&#10;    Storm Over Scandinavia Scenario rules (70 pages)&#10;    Storm Over Scandinavia orders of battle (60 pages)&#10;    8 map sections (5C-NW; 5C-SW; 5C-NE; 10B-NW; 10B-SW; 10B-NE; 10B-SE; 13A-NE) - each 1/4 Europa map size&#10;    2 map sections (1C-NW; 5C-SE)  - each 1/8 Europa map size&#10;    Five countersheets (Europa countersheet n&deg; 91, 92, 93, 94; Europa Universal marker sheet) - 1,400 counters&#10;    4 Narvik charts &amp; tables&#10;    8 Storm Over Scandinavia charts &amp; tables&#10;    5 Grand Europa  charts/tables/displays&#10;&#10;&#10;Note on maps: 1C, 5C, 10B, 13A were Europa full maps; NW=NorthWest,  SW=SouthWest'...etc'&#10;&#10;(BGG user's description)&#10;&#10;&#10;Narvik:&#10;This is an intense combined arms game. Germany has an overwhelming array of ground, sea and air forces for the invasion. The Allies have time and space on their side. While they can not stand toe to toe with the Germans, they can cause a lot of trouble; they can win the game. This is the second most popular The Europa Series game ever produced. It has a very even play balance and offers unending variations.Storm Over Scandinavia:&#10;The code name of the invasion: Weserubung. It started out as a junior officer and high command war game. A &quot;what-if&quot; scenario on how to invade Norway. It ended up as a full-blown, multi-corps invasion on the event of Germany's attack on France. The Europa level invasion of Norway. The combined arms are also present. The unit and time scales are at Europa levels.&#10;&#10;The Four Hour War:&#10;Germany invades Denmark. Will the Danes resist (that would make it a Five Hour War)? Germany used Denmark as a stepping stone to Norway. Germany had to have a perfect invasion of Denmark to ensure a chance of success against Norway. If you choose to play this scenario, as the Germans, good luck. It is an eye-popping special ops gamble. If you lose as the Germans, no easy invasion for Norway.&#10;&#10;Northern Theater of Operations (NTO):&#10;NTO Combines Weserubung and A Winter War. It begins with the Soviet attack against Finland. The western Allies may intervene to aid Finland. To do so they must transit through Norway. Norway may disagree with this and the Germans may intervene to prevent the Allied intervention. Makes your head hurt, don't it? Ownership of A Winter War (currently available from Games Research/Design (GR/D)) is required for this scenario.&#10;&#10;Invasion Sweden:&#10;No tour of Scandinavia is complete without a visit to sunny Sweden, right? Well, why would the Germans invade Sweden? To prevent them from helping Norway? Maybe. To ensure a flow of iron ore to Germany? Perhaps. Because they can? Why not. Germany decided against this invasion, but now you have the option of testing out such an invasion in this scenario.&#10;&#10;(from back of the box)&#10;&#10;",

The book includes all the tables and charts needed to play as well as cardboard units to be cut out and a terrain map for a small battle. Leeson's translation includes some elements from later developments in the game, until about 1870, when the &quot;Rigid Kriegspiel&quot; (rules-based) of Von Reisswitz gave way to the &quot;Free Kriegspiel&quot; system (based on the umpire's judgment and experience). The aim of the rules is well described by the subtitle &quot;Instructions for the Representation of Military Maneuvers with Kriegspiel Apparatus.&quot;&#10;&#10;The book has been reprinted by Too Fat Lardies in 2007.&#10;&#10;",
