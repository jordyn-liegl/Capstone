    "description": "Two Lancastrians and two Yorkists draft cards that give them control of major towns, nobles, bishops and royal castles. Income generated by these enables them to raise armies and to bribe nobles, bishops and ship captains to change allegiance. Players then use secret planning and simultaneous deployment to gain control of the six areas in England and Wales and, hopefully, enough votes in parliament to crown their royal heir as king.&#10;&#10;From the back of the box:&#10;&#10;        Journey back to England, 1450, just prior to the outbreak of the bitter civil war between the Royal Houses of Lancaster and York. Henry VI, a Lancastrian, was proving to be a weak ruler, so the wealthy and ambitious Richard, Duke of York, looked to put things right. The powerful noble families had to choose sides and over the next 40 years, kings, royal heirs, and great nobles were to die, in what was to become known as the Wars of the Roses. Players take on the role of Lancastrians and Yorkists, who must gather support from the major towns and powerful noble families and attempt to control the royal castles throughout the country. Ports, the shipping trade, and financial aid from the Church and France are also needed. As their faction grows in strength, players vie for the King&rsquo;s favor and look to earn the prestigious titles of Captain of Calais, Archbishop of Canterbury, Warden of the Cinque Ports, Lord High Admiral and Constable of the Tower of London. Money means power, because loyalty can be bought, so players should be prepared for the inevitable treachery as nobles change allegiance at crucial times, affecting the balance of power. When Parliament is called, each region in England will support one or other of the two Royal Houses and the crown will go to the one with the greater power base. Nobles loyal to this House will be rewarded by a grateful King. Eventually, only one Royal House will boast the King, but the player who has gathered the most money and prestige will win, regardless of his allegiance.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "A game tracing the development of railways on the Isle of Wight, 1860 is part of the 18xx series of economic railway games, based on Francis Tresham's original concepts.&#10;&#10;As in other 18xx games, the winner is the player with the greatest combined wealth (cash on hand + value of stocks held + value of private companies owned) at the end of the game. Play  progresses in a series of alternating stock and operating rounds. During stock rounds, players may purchase and sell stock in corporations.  During operating rounds, the corporations lay track, place railway stations (tokens), run trains for revenue to be withheld or paid out, and purchase trains. The player who owns the most stock in a given corporation makes all decisions for said corporation during an operating round.&#10;&#10;The game is notable for the small size of the board compared to many 18xx games, and its innovative game end: The climax of play sees the beginnings of railway nationalization in the United Kingdom, with the weakest companies being eliminated from private operation earlier than those which are the healthiest.&#10;&#10;Other notable differences from most 18xx games include:&#10;-Players may own up to 100% of a corporation, and may sell presidents&rsquo; certificates into the bank pool, at which time a corporation goes into receivership and continues to operate.&#10;-Corporations are never required to own trains, and thus player bankruptcy is impossible.  Instead, a trainless corporation becomes insolvent and leases a train based on the current phase, withholding all earnings. &#10;-Corporations are allowed to run one train through one &ldquo;tokened out&rdquo; city once per operating  round, which makes strategic route building and station placement key.&#10;&#10;The game was initially produced in a small print run of c.100 copies.  JKLM and Z-Man games released a larger, but still limited, 2nd edition (with an alternate map) in 2010. In 2021, All-Aboard Games funded the publication of a 3rd edition through Kickstarter which was backed more than 1000 times.&#10;&#10;",

By collecting goods (salt, barley, tea, jade, and gold), you can make offers to monasteries, send out delegations to different regions or bargain to increase your livestock. All this to become the most prosperous caravaneer in all of the Himalaya!&#10;&#10;Players program their caravans around the paths on the Himalayan plateau to collect various goods, and then deliver them.  Each turn players plan in advance six moves for their caravan, trying to second-guess what other players will do to their best advantage.  Delivering goods allows the player to increase their influence in one of three separate categories - each delivery allows you to advance your position in two of the three categories.  Religious influence is marked by the number and value of your stupas in buildings on the board, political influence is marked by the number of sherpas you have in the regions between the paths on the board, and economical influence is marked by the total number of yaks you have on your delivery disks.&#10;&#10;The scoring is unique to the game, in the 4 player game anyway (the player count the game is primarily designed to be played with).  To determine the winner you first score up religious influence, and the player with the least religious influence is eliminated, and their remaining pieces are removed from the board.  Next the player with the least political influence is eliminated.  The remaining two players decide the winner by who has the greatest economic influence.  This unusual scoring is what makes this game different from many other similar games.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "This description was originally based on a review from BoardgameNews.com.&#10;&#10;In this corporation-themed game, players compete to be the first to acquire four out of six possible victory points. You earn a point by reaching certain numbers along tracks, such as at least 7 on the influence track or 8 on the majority track. You also may earn a point by beating your secretly assigned archenemy on three specified tracks.&#10;&#10;The game lasts a number of rounds, with each round consisting of a directors' meeting, followed by 4-7 turns. At the meeting, the &quot;company chairman&quot; is replaced (the next token in line moves up) and the &quot;division heads&quot; are named (by seeing who has the majority in each column of placed cubes). Chairmen and heads get salary bonuses and a card detailing a single advantage for the cardholder.&#10;&#10;The player who's the &quot;communications&quot; head then secretly looks at the Event cards and determines in which order they will be played (and so how many turns will be in the current round). Other heads' cards will let them pay less for stocks, for example, or place or remove bits.&#10;&#10;After each event card is revealed, players select one action to perform, such as &quot;hiring and relocating employees&quot; (placing or moving cubes), resigning as a department head, using an advantage card, or bribing players for their advantage cards. These actions result in points on the scoring tracks and sometimes money (which is only used for bribery and buying blocks of stock). A bribed card has more power than an earned one, giving incentive to accept bribes (the card is less useful or even useless to the original owner, depending on the workers' happiness scale). In addition to bribery getting you a power you want, it also moves you up the corruption track. A player who rejects a bribe, however, loses one cube on the majority columns.&#10;&#10;It's not a business simulation, and gameplay isn't as dastardly as the theme implies. The event cards provide most of the humor. (The card may read that you have failed to fix the breakroom game table, or vacations were canceled, so worker satisfaction goes down, which is what you want). The feel of rising through the ranks (getting more points) is there, and there are many things to attempt to excel in, by doing various business-related (at least in name) actions. Efficient manipulating of your opportunities will win you victory points and, if you gain four, the game.&#10;&#10;Awards: &#10;Machtspiele (Power $truggle) is derived from &quot;Die Firma&quot;, which won a special prize in the 2009 Hippodice game design competition for best full-length game.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "In Mangrovia, a light &quot;gamer's game&quot;/family game with a Caribbean mangrove setting, a clever role selection mechanism allows the players to choose two different bonuses/actions as well as the turn order in which they want these actions to be carried out &mdash; all by placing just one marker. Victory is achievable through a number of viable options, which guarantees high re-playability.&#10;&#10;The game is a fight over acquiring the best locations for your huts in this appealing and unspoiled landscape. If you manage to do so, you will become the rightful successor of the old chief and win the game. You gain Chief points by having the most huts (and the secondmost huts) along each of the eight divine paths monitored by the statues of Gods. Additional Chief points are earned by controlling sacred locations, by collecting amulets, and simply by building huts at lucrative spaces.&#10;&#10;Building a hut requires that the space's landscape is &quot;active&quot; and that you can pay the exact price (not overpay) for the space. Therefore, the game feels tight even from the very start. The game gets tighter and tighter towards the end of the game as you have fewer choices of spaces, and as the actions you choose become more and more crucial.&#10;&#10;In order to succeed in this game, you should carefully choose and time the best possible combination of actions, called &quot;ritual sites&quot;. A boat goes from ritual site to ritual site, first on the west side, then on the east side (in opposite order), triggering each action. If, for instance, you choose a ritual site high up, you will have an early choice of cards, but a late choice of space to build your huts or to collect amulets (and vice versa). A fourth action type is to select &quot;active landscapes&quot; and become starting player, which makes it possible to control the next round. After all players have performed two actions, the round ends. The game is usually played over 10-14 rounds and ends when one player builds his last hut.&#10;&#10;Collecting amulets may be key in this game. Instead of keeping them as Chief points, you may use them to build huts on designated spaces which require payment in amulets instead of cards &mdash; and still to the exact price. Building huts on such spaces may be exactly what you need to get the majority along one or two divine paths. In order to gain enough amulets &mdash; and amulets of the appropriate values &mdash; you should position some of your huts on amulet spaces. The more huts you build on such spaces, the more amulets you can draw. The probability of getting the amulets you need will therefore increase.&#10;&#10;The game board is built as a matrix system, with some spaces being part of two divine paths while other spaces belong to just one. The spaces that are part of two divine paths are obviously most tempting, but can you afford to build your huts there?&#10;&#10;",

This is tricky as each player's color is chosen at random and kept hidden until the end of the game. Each of the 12 regions of the board contains five areas, each area containing one of four different terrain types. Each area receives one hut each of five different colors. On their turn, a player moves all huts from one area containing less than seven to an adjacent occupied area, all the while trying to hide which color is theirs. After moving, if one or more areas are completely surrounded by empty areas, they are scored. If all colors are present in a scoring, any colors with only one hut present are removed. The epoch track allows a limited number of areas to score before the game ends, and each scoring can gain a bonus or score nothing depending on the terrain type in which scoring occurred and how far along the track the game has progressed; each scoring advances the track, and each section of the track gives different terrain types bonuses and penalties.&#10;&#10;Once at least twelve areas have scored the game ends, then players reveal their colors to find out who was best able to score the most points while keeping their color a secret.&#10;&#10;",

Experience points are handed out generously, allowing players to build interesting and unique characters in the consolidated timespan required in a tabletop experience. Session to session progression is meaningful, but players are not required to remember complex narrative points or play with the same group forever.&#10;&#10;",

As your intrepid adventurers delve through the ruins, they will face deadly traps guarding the ancient relics they prize.&#10;&#10;User Summary:&#10;&#10;A very light dice-roller, basically a fun simulation of Indiana-Jones-style temple robbers. Players move through a Mayan temple, risking constant death while trying to get to the exit, carrying as much treasure as they dare. The more treasure cards you have, the fewer actions you might get this round. If your character gets killed, a second one can drop in and you may still get enough treasure and escape to win.&#10;&#10;The temple starts with a room of crushing walls, leading into a winding passage that takes you past a lava pit and locked alcoves. The passage goes on, with two short-cuts that might save you time; a fast river or a rickety wooden bridge. You must balance attempts to grab treasure from the rooms, as you pass through, with staying ahead of a massive boulder, tumbling down the passage after you. If you have to let the boulder pass or be crushed to death, then you're forced to jump in the river and risk drowning just to get ahead. Otherwise, the boulder reaches the exit before you, blocking it and you're trapped forever.&#10;&#10;A mix of very basic lucky dice-rolling, lucky card draw for the treasure, and some decision-making about possible risks. Beautifully produced, with 12 small but detailed plastics miniatures, and an exotic and deadly temple. Adults may tire from repeats of The Adventurers, but kids will get lots of thrills.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Aim of the game from the rulebook:&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to build the most successful Underground lines and in doing so gain the most points.  You can gain points by connecting your lines to various destinations on the board, and by having the passenger use your lines to travel from station to station.&#10;&#10;The player who has best balanced the demands by the time that the deck of destinations is exhausted will be declared the winner.&#10;&#10;Gameplay overview:&#10;&#10;In On the Underground, the players represent companies building underground lines in London. Each player controls 2-4 different lines (based on the number of players).&#10;&#10;On each turn, a player can build four pieces of track on the map in any of their color. All track pieces must extend the color. Alternatively, a player may decide to use two branch tokens (acquired by extending lines to the terminus stations or skipping building turns) to branch out of the line.&#10;&#10;During the track building part, the active player can score in four different ways:&#10;&#10;     Connect their line to a station with a National Rail symbol (1p)&#10;     Connect their line to a terminus station (2p + a branch token)&#10;     Connect two connection tokens of the same type (3p)&#10;     Building a circular line (1p for each station &quot;inside&quot; the line)&#10;&#10;&#10;After each turn, the passenger moves to one or two of the four face up destination cards; first to one express destination and then to a regular destination. If there are no cards face up in either type, the passenger only moves once. The passenger always uses the shortest route from their current position, avoiding walking and line changes. The passenger scores one point for each line they used to get to their destination.&#10;&#10;When there is not enough destination cards to turn face up from the deck, the passenger marker is removed from the game. Players get equal turns, but after the passenger marker is removed, no more points are awarded from passenger movement and players can only build track. The player with the highest amount of points wins.&#10;&#10;",

Unfortunately for the baby Gulo, all the adult Gulos are distracted by all the delicious swamp vulture eggs, and it has to wait very, very patiently as the adults constantly trip the very, very sensitive &quot;egg alarm&quot; rigged by the vulture to scare off the pesky Gulos.&#10;&#10;There is a nice wooden bowl filled with multicolored swamp vulture eggs of various sizes, into which a long thin dowel with another egg at one end is inserted, like a flagpole.  As you can imagine, lots of M&amp;M Peanut-shaped wooden bits banging around together in a polished wooden bowl makes it rather difficult to keep a thin dowel with weight at the top balanced...&#10;&#10;The essential mechanic of the game is to try to pull an egg of a particular color and move to a tile of that color on the linear path toward the bowl, and the little stack of tiles hiding the baby Gulo tile.  If you set off the alarm, or knock any eggs out of the bowl, your Gulo is sent back to the previous tile of the attempted color.  If there's no such tile, then back to the start he goes!&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Egizia: Shifting Sands is an updated version of the beloved strategy game Egizia. Players travel down the Nile, placing boats as they go, to collect resources that will help them construct some of Egypt's most famous monuments. With new monuments to build, new cards to collect, and a constantly shifting river, Egizia: Shifting Sands Edition is a streamlined, modern update that both longtime fans and new players can easily pick up and enjoy.&#10;&#10;In Egizia, players must place their pawns following the course of the Nile, moving northwards. In this way, each placement not only blocks the opponents from choosing the same square (except monuments, where multiple players are always allowed), but also forces the player to place their remaining pawns only on the squares below the one they just occupied.&#10;&#10;When the placement phase is over, the workers of the players (which are separate from the pawns) must be fed with the grain produced in the fields. The production of each field is based on the floods of the Nile, so some fields may not give grain each turn. If a player doesn't have enough grain for all their workers, they must buy it with victory points. After that, stones are received from the owned quarries and used to build the monuments (if the right to do so was reserved earlier) along with the workers.&#10;&#10;In this new edition, players each get a chance to build across the Colonnade, a new monument. The more columns you build, the better powers you unlock to help you on the river. Perhaps once per turn you can place boats on occupied river spaces or upstream, or gain an extra point each time you place bricks in monuments. With randomized rewards from game to game, the Colonnade is a dynamic new monument to shake up traditional gameplay.&#10;&#10;Below the Colonnade, where the graves once stood, lie the mysterious statues &mdash; a new monument unlike anything else in Egizia. These tiny build sites are cheaper than any other monument, but they hold the potential for high reward if you fulfill their requirements. Players must plan early as they can place only one brick in a statue per round, and each level they build has more strenuous requirements for endgame bonuses.&#10;&#10;Egizia: Shifting Sands keeps all the painstaking risk/reward decisions of the original Egizia and adds new depths of strategy, balance, and gameplay for a fresh twist on a timeless classic.&#10;&#10;",

In Capital Lux, you always balance on a razor's edge, so will you take risks? Bluff? Or follow a carefully laid plan? The choice is yours in this clever card game, featuring beautiful art by American painter Kwanchai Moriya.&#10;&#10;Each round begins with the players drafting a hand of five or six character cards. On your turn, you must play a card either in front of you (your hometown) or in the middle of the table (the capital). When you play a card into the capital, you benefit from the card's special ability. Each character belongs to one of four professions, and their special abilities are:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Merchant: Take 1 gold coin. Gold coins can be used at the end of a round to increase your own limit for one of the four professions.&#10;    Agent: Draw a secret modifier card and add it (face down) to one of the four professions in the capital. This will affect the limit of the chosen profession at round's end.&#10;    Scholar: Draw a card from the deck into your hand.&#10;    Cleric: Move the lowest valued card of any profession from the capital into your hometown&#10;&#10;&#10;At the end of a round, for each profession, you are not allowed to have a higher total value in your hometown than the current total value in the capital. If you break the limit for one of the professions, you lose all cards of that profession from your hometown. At the end of the third round, all characters remaining in a player's hometown are worth points.&#10;&#10;This means that for every card there's a dilemma of whether to add it to your hometown for possible points, or to the capital which not only gives you the benefit from a special ability, but also increases the potential points for all players. Since every player is dealt only five or six cards at the beginning of a round, every card play is crucial...&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Carrom is most easily described as &quot;finger pool&quot;. On a 29&quot; x 29&quot; wooden board, players flick a large weighted disc (the striker) at smaller wooden discs (the carrom-men). The goal is to sink your 9 carrom-men (black or white), as well as the red Queen, in the four corner pockets. The first player or team to accomplish this collects points for the round (commonly called a &quot;board&quot;). A standard game of Carrom continues until one player has 25 points or 8 boards have been completed.&#10;&#10;Carrom is typically played with powder, and some variations of the game use cues.  The most widely played form of 'proper' Carrom is supported by a world wide set of rules known as The Laws of Carrom, and are available from the International Carrom Federation.&#10;&#10;Carrom bears similarities to Pool and Crokinole, but is a fascinating game in its own right with varied strategies and techniques. No one knows exactly where the game originated. It could have come from Bangladesh, Burma, Egypt, or Ethiopia, but most believe it originated in India.&#10;&#10;Also see American Carrom and the European games in a similar vein, Korona and H-ring spel.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Rise of Empires is an empire-building game in which players develop their ever changing empire from Ancient Age to Modern Age. War, economics, science and diplomacy are to be taken into consideration to successfully win this epic game.&#10;&#10;In Rise of Empires two to five players are building their own civilization from the dawn of history to present times. All players start small and fairly powerless, however, through clever play they try to gain wealth and progress in several areas.  Like many empire building games, it is possible to be wiped from the board one turn, only to return the next in another area.&#10;&#10;Rise of Empires is divided into three eras. Each era consists of two game turns. The core of the game is the Action Display where players conduct various actions during a turn. The first turn in an era is called the A turn, the second one the B turn. In a way, the B turn is a mirror image of the A turn.&#10;&#10;The aim of the game is to have the most victory points at the end. Victory points are scored by building cities, having an empire (area control), developing technology, and trading goods.&#10;&#10;In contrast to some other civilization type games, Rise of Empires plays fairly quickly. A full game can be completed in less than three hours.  It is also more abstract than many civ games, in that cities, towns, and technologies are represented by tiles the players keep, even if their civilization is buried in the sands of time.&#10;&#10;Publisher Blurb:&#10;&#10;Don't just make history-guide it! Take the reins of a developing civilization, choosing the resources and development paths that will lead to the fastest expansion, as you claim and defend territory on a map forging an empire that eventually encompasses whole continents.&#10;&#10;Rise of Empires play is divided into three eras. Choices made early in the era are repeated late, so your decisions must have both short-term and long-term benefits to be successful. This process requires tough decision-making and promotes an atmosphere with nail-biting suspense. Victory points are rewarded for building cities, having an empire, for progress in science, and for trading goods.&#10;&#10;Rise of Empires breathes new life into the civilization games genre! Balance gold and food, war and agriculture, territory and technology to forge an empire that is destined to rise above all other nations!&#10;&#10;Each copy of Rise of Empires contains:&#10;. 1 large game board&#10;. 1 tiles display&#10;. 40 resource discs&#10;. 150 player cubes in 5 colors&#10;. 45 action discs in 5 colors&#10;. 8 empire tiles&#10;. 40 territory tiles&#10;. 48 progress tiles&#10;. 36 city tiles&#10;. 104 gold markers&#10;. 5 alliance pieces&#10;. 5 player aid cards&#10;. 1 rules booklet with illustrated example of play.&#10;&#10;",

The fight seems unfair as the seven of you might not seem to measure up to the dozens of enemies who want to slice you to pieces &mdash; but this comparison doesn't take into account your strong combat skills and an efficient team spirit that binds your samurai squad enough to face the threat. Above all else, when everything seems desperate and lost, your enemies will discover that inside each of you lies a true beast, a warrior spirit ready to unleash its full power!&#10;&#10;Samurai Spirit is a co-operative game in which each player is a fierce samurai defending a village surrounded by a horde of bandits. The game plays out over three turns during which each player takes turns drawing bandit cards, then choosing whether they want to fight the bandit, defend the village, or let the bandit pass in order to help the other samurai.&#10;&#10;The challenge of the game consists of balancing your choices: Should you fight each enemy to quickly reach your beast capacities, while also coming closer to the death and risking further loss by not defending the village sufficiently? Should you mainly defend or help the other samurai, taking the risk of remaining human too long and therefore weaker, when you know that weakness will be a major problem when facing the lieutenant and the villain bosses? Each enemy presents a tough choice to you, your team, and ultimately the whole village! Each turn ends with farms and fences being destroyed, and since those aren't unlimited, you must do what's necessary to end the game with at least one undamaged farm and enough farmers to tend it. Do you have what it takes to stand against evil and become a true hero?&#10;&#10;Fight with courage, smartly assist your teammates, defend the poor villagers, turn into a savage beast, and wreak havoc on the enemy lines &mdash; all of this is up to you! Ultimately it would be your honor to chose to die in a ultimate sacrifice in order to save the village. All of this is what makes the true samurai spirit!&#10;&#10;",

It challenges players to build combinations of abilities, as well as to correctly calculate the advantage of delayed gratification for actions.&#10;&#10;In the game, players are merchants in Amsterdam near the turn of the 20th century. At the start of the game, two district cards are placed on each of the twelve spaces on the designated board. At the beginning of a round, the next two district cards, as well as two building and two profession cards (each from a deck of 54 of each type) are drawn to form the offer of six cards. Each of these cards has a cost in colored action cubes and grants a new action, special ability, or way to score points. In turn order, each player takes a card from those on offer. Finally, a market card is revealed that allows players to exchange money for victory points on their turn.&#10;&#10;Next, the six colored dice are rolled. Each player decides which of the six dice they would like (players may choose the same die), then takes as many action cubes in that color as the number of pips. Players place their new action cubes on their rotatable windrose as many spaces in the future as the number on the dice. Finally, the wheel is spun, so that players gain access to all cubes that were located on the 1 space of their windrose.&#10;&#10;Action cubes are used to purchase cards that a player has taken, claim one of the nine types of goods around the city of Amsterdam, and ferry goods or workers through canals to warehouses. Players earn points for delivering their goods, as well as for bonuses on cards they purchase, and the player with the most points at the end of the twelfth round wins.&#10;&#10;",

In the late 18th Century, the Shawnee and Iroquois Indians pointed white Desperadoes, Mercenaries and Adventurers in the direction of hidden caches of valuable jewels, in the hopes of turning them against one another and away from their territorial expansion ambitions. Players play as some of those Adventurers.&#10;&#10;The first player to be able to claim ownership of five jewels is the winner. But the chase after the riches has some snags. The speed of the river is always changing, since the speed depends on the decisions of the players and the changeable weather.

    "description": "In Babel, each player makes use of members of various tribes of the ancient world to build temples, exploit (or exterminate) their opponent's work force, destroy or steal their opponent's temples and otherwise do whatever it takes to build the tallest temples to win the game.&#10;&#10;The game plays out on a small game board representing regions of 5 ancient civilizations, Medes, Sumerians, Hittites, Persians, and Assyrians.  Each player will be dealt a hand of cards (consisting of 5 types corresponding to the above tribes).  Players themselves are represented by stone figures.  Temple cards will be made available at the side of the board for building throughout the game.  On his or her turn, a player may discard a card to move to the corresponding region, place a card on the region they are currently located, build a temple by having tribesmen equal to the number or level on the temple card AND having built the previous (lower) temple level, move tribesmen from one region to another, or perform a skill action unique to each tribe.  Players may perform any and all actions available to them, being able to perform most actions as many times as they wish and saving any number of unplayed cards for subsequent turns.&#10;&#10;A big component of this game is placing your tribe cards in sets. Skills can only be used if a set of three (or more) cards is at the same location as the player marker.  By discarding one of the cards of a set, the skill may be used.  No matter the tribe, performing this action can force the opponent to discard half their hand.  Other skills, such as robbing a temple from an opponent, skipping a level on a temple build, destroy an opposing temple, etc. are specific to the tribe activated.&#10;&#10;Game play progresses until one of two conditions is met: if a player builds 15 points (or levels) of temples before the opposing player builds at least 10 points, that player wins.  If the opponent does have more than 10 points, the game continues until one player reaches 20 points (in which case he or she wins) OR one player subsequently drops below 10 (in which case he or she loses).&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Tiny Epic Pirates is a 45 minute, 1-4 player game of high-seas adventure, utilizing a variable rondel action system and action combo-ing!.  In Tiny Epic Pirates you take control of a Pirate ship with the goal of burying vast amounts of wealth on secret island hideaways.&#10;&#10;Each turn, you move your Captain Token around your ship&rsquo;s action wheel (rondel), selecting which action to perform... Plunder, Trade, Crew Up, Attack, or Search. Each player has a randomized and unique arrangement of these actions on their rondel. Sailing your Pirate Ship is something every player can do every time they take an action. Plundering allows you to acquire booty from settlements at a very reasonable rate. It&rsquo;s amazing how negotiating changes when your blunderbuss is at the ready. A crate of gunpowder for a promise of no harm? Fair exchange. Trading allows you to sell your ill-gotten goods to the Black Market for gold. Each Market is only interested in a specific good, so make sure you are sailing in the right direction. Timing is everything, sell your good at the wrong time and it&rsquo;s worth a pittance. Crew Up adds a new crew member to your growing Pirate Ship. Crew increases your ship&rsquo;s combat advantage and unlocks new abilities for each spoke of your ship&rsquo;s action wheel, making that action more powerful every time you take it!  Attacking Merchant Ships and other Pirates will  grow your reputation. It also happens to be a great way to score some gold and more booty to sell. Be enough of a menace and you may just become a Legend of the Sea!&#10;&#10;Search the high-seas for treasures left behind by the unfortunate souls that preceded you. Salvage old ship parts for temporary aid or get lucky and find something worth selling.&#10;&#10;The end of the game is triggered once a player has buried three treasures. To do this, a player must first acquire the amount of gold required to bury at the various bury spots on the map. After all players have had an equal number of turns. The player who has buried three treasures wins the game. Ties are decided by the player who has the highest legendary status, followed by which player has the most gold.&#10;&#10;--description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The characteristics of this salty lake make it a unique location to generate geothermal energy, which takes advantage of the heat from the planet. In this area of intense geothermal activity, you will drill the ground and extract brine which, once processed, allows us to obtain the valuable lithium and sell it as part of a modern industry, far from fossil fuels, that will allow you to lead the energy transition towards a completely renewable future.&#10;&#10;Designed by David Bernal and illustrated by Amelia Sales, Salton Sea can be enjoyed alone or in groups of up to four players in sessions lasting about 120 minutes. During the game, players must manage their geothermal lithium extraction companies to obtain the greatest number of points. The extraction of this material and its subsequent processing will be the driving force of your companies.&#10;&#10;On your turn, place one of your four engineers on one of the available spaces to take an action. There are three different groups of actions: industrial actions (which allow you to obtain an exploration license, drill, extract, process or repair machinery), commercial actions (sell, acquire contract and execute contract), and management actions (research, buy shares, develop the business project or finance itself). It is up to you to manage the engineers at each point of the game to get the most out of your company.&#10;&#10;However, there is no single path to success. The game will reward you for exhausted land, executed contracts, short-term objectives, company development, or research advances. Will you master the power of the Salton Sea to create the most efficient geothermal company?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Mr. President is a solitaire game about governing as the President of the United States. It's not an election game. It begins after you've been elected. It's about sitting in The Chair and trying to advance your agenda while navigating ongoing crises, political enemies, public opinion, your relations with Congress and the press, and keeping your country secure in a world of rival nations and agendas that just seems to keep blowing up around you. Mr. President is a resource management game, where you never have enough resources to achieve your entire agenda, and the path you take through an always unpredictable storyline rests on the choices you make. Depending on the results of those choices, and on the unfolding of a &quot;different every game&quot; story, you'll either be thinking &quot;POTUS? Piece of Cake!&quot; or &quot;Why was it that I WANTED this job?&quot; many times in each game.&#10;&#10;Like the actual President, you'll have an array of allies and resources to help you as you navigate both the corridors of power in the nation's capital and the uncertainties of international relations. These allies and resources will vary from game to game, but you'll always be able to rely on your Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense to help you with foreign policy and with the use, where you deem necessary, of the combat power of the U.S. military. You'll also have a bevy of domestic advisors and friends in Congress to help you navigate the many challenges in Congress and domestic life and politics. And you'll always have access to at least one truly exceptional talent (this, too, will vary from game to game), someone who excels in their particular job and is a &quot;force multiplier&quot; for you in their own unique way. How you lead and utilize this mix of talents and experience at your disposal will go a long way toward determining your success or failure during your shot at being Mr. President.&#10;&#10;Game Play&#10;&#10;The Map. The game map allows you to see and track the domestic and world situation that the game creates. It is divided into sections:&#10;&#10;1. Congress. This is where you track progress of legislation, as well as keep track of your friends and opponents in Congress.&#10;&#10;2. Advisors and Assets. This section of the map is a holding area for all of your advisors, available action points, and military assets.&#10;&#10;3. Crisis Management. This is where you manage the Crisis Cards and keep track of crisis status and how well you've dealt with each crisis.&#10;&#10;4. The World portion of the map (about half of the map) is divided into eight world regions, with additional sections for Russia and China (your key potential antagonists in the game). Here's a look at the South America Region, as an example of the regional displays:&#10;&#10;Crisis Cards. At the heart of Mr. President are the 150+ Crisis Cards that help create the storyline for each game. These cards - see the 12 sample cards on this page - are a mix of cards representing Domestic or World Crises, Terrorism Events, Unexpected Benefits, and Opportunities. The Crisis Cards help drive, but do not completely control, the storyline in each game. Here's how it works:&#10;&#10;Each game of Mr. President is divided into eight turns, each representing six months in office. These turns are further divided into six Rounds, each representing one month.&#10;&#10;At the start of each turn, you get to perform assessment and planning actions, where you get to lay out your rough plan, re-examine strategy, re-evaluate the threats and opportunities that were presenting as the previous turn ended (or at game start). So there is definitely a proactive strategy piece to the game. Unfortunately, though, your plans are not often going to survive intact once the turn gets going. The world stage is a dynamic platform.&#10;&#10;Once you have your plans made (and the Mr. President gods laugh at you!), you perform the six monthly rounds in order. During each round, you draw three Crisis Cards that represent that main world or domestic events that happen (these are usually bad from your point of view, but occasionally they are events or resources that help you) during that month. Most of the events on the Crisis Cards present you with both an urgent problem that may immediately alter the board state, and a longer term issue that may linger and cause you pain down the road if you don't address it well.&#10;&#10;After you flip and resolve the three Crisis Cards for the round, you get to take actions, using any of your available personnel and resources. These actions allow you  to make progress on your legislative agenda, attempt to address any new crises presented by the round's three actions cards, deal with any lingering world or domestic issues, fight terrorism, perform diplomacy, and attempt to better your situation in the world or in the eyes of the American people.&#10;&#10;Once you finish your action portion of the round, that round (month) is finished, and you move on to the next round, drawing three new Crisis Cards and repeating the round process until the 6-month turn is complete.&#10;&#10;Seeded within the 18-card mix that makes up a turn, you have six cards for Russian and Chinese Actions, Terror Actions, War Progress, Crisis Checks, and White House Life. You know that each of these six cards will show up sometime during each turn, but you don't know when. The variable timing of these cards' appearance each turn adds uncertainty and spice to the game, while ensuring that major players in the game present challenges for you every single turn. Russia and China offer deeper challenges, with four possible postures (aggression levels) for each country and a country-specific AI for each. Postures may shift in-game in response to your actions or to storyline events, making dealing positively with each nation an evolving challenge all game.&#10;&#10;Please note that Mr. President is NOT a &quot;beer and pretzels&quot; surface-level game. This game is intended to be deep and immersive, one that will both frustrate and delight the solitaire player. Playing time is four to eight hours (depending on your experience level) to play an entire 4-year term. I've tried to pack as much fun as possible into each 6-month turn, so that even if you only have time to play one turn on a weeknight, you'll be engaged, frustrated, challenged, and immersed throughout. That said, I hope you're going to find it difficult to stop playing after each turn. I've designed Mr. President to be an experience that will wrap you up in each new game's story, and beckon you back to the game table after each round, turn, or completed game.&#10;&#10;I designed this game to provide massive replayability. With over 150 Crisis cards in the mix, and multiple subsystems representing the US Economy, Congress, Homeland Security, the Press, Presidential Prestige, Russia, China, Hostile Rogue States, and staunch Allies, no two games of Mr. President will ever play remotely alike. If you think you're ready for that challenge, go ahead. Raise your right hand and swear the oath. Then settle in behind the desk in the Oval Office, and let your imagination run wild!&#10;&#10;I hope playing Mr. President brings you as much enjoyment as designing it has brought me!&#10;&#10;- Gene&#10;&#10;Components&#10;&#10;One 5&quot; deep Game Box&#10;    One 22&quot; x 34&quot; mounted game board&#10;    One 22&quot; x 17&quot; mounted game board&#10;    180 Cards&#10;    500+ counters and markers&#10;    One &quot;How to Play&quot; rulebook&#10;    One &quot;How to Play a Turn&quot; FlipBook&#10;    One Scenario Book&#10;    One World Chart Book&#10;    One Domestic Chart Book&#10;    Two Peer Competitor Action Books for Russia and China&#10;    Six Player Aid cards&#10;    One 10-sided die&#10;    One 6-sided die&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Theme:&#10;&#10;Talisman is an adventure board game set in a high fantasy medieval world.  Players have 14 characters to choose from all based on role playing archetypes, such as heroes, wizards, villains, thieves, monsters, etc.  The game makes players feel they are traveling the world to find equipment, weapons, ancient relics, and companions that will help them on their quest to acquire the Crown of Command.  Along the way they visit various locales in the worlds, battle each other and fantastic creatures to make their way to the top.&#10;&#10;Goal:&#10;&#10;Each player is trying to move from the outer world and ultimately to the inner world. Players wander the outer, middle, and inner worlds trying to acquire equipment, weapons, and companions.  They will also improve statistics with equipment, companions, and encounters and battles with fantasy creatures and each other.  Once they complete a Talisman quest, players will enter the inner world and face its challenges to finally reach the Portal of Power to claim the Crown of Command.  Then the other players must race to stop this player before he eventually kills them all with the Command spell.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;&#10;To begin, players select a character card from among the 14 provided.  Characters have basic statistics to start.  These are Life [hit points], Strength [physical prowess], and Craft [Magic and Intelligence].  Some characters are naturally more gifted in combat and others in magic, while others are mix of the two.  Additionally characters are often differentiated with unique abilities, starting equipment, and starting spells.  This all makes the players actually feel different during play.  In addition items and companions players acquire during play also add to statistics, increasing Strength, Craft, Life or adding new abilities, etc.&#10;&#10;Actual game play is relatively simple, making the game easy to pick up with novices.  On a player's turn they throw a die for movement.  Player then chooses which direction, left or right, or if meeting qualifications may be able to move from outer to middle world, or middle to inner world.  Once on space, player follows instructions on space, or encounters face up cards already in space, or other player if in space.  Most spaces have a player draw a number of cards to encounter.  These can be creatures, companions, weapons, equipment, treasure, or relics.  Players must fight creatures and win before acquiring any other items or companions.  If another player is in the space, players may attack with either Craft or Strength but are not required to do so.  The defender defends with same statistic attacked with.  If the defender loses, he loses a life and an item or companion of attackers choice.  If the attacker loses, he loses a life.&#10;&#10;Players start in the outer world, and build up their character's statistics and items to try and move to the middle world.  There are two ways to move up to the middle world, one requiring a test of strength and the other a boat man's ride for a price.  Once in the middle world, play proceeds in the same manner, but the challenge generally is increased with more threats such as the desert and temple.  However, there is more potential for encounters and items as most spaces now draw more than one card.&#10;&#10;In the middle world, players may also acquire a Talisman quest, that once completed, will grant them a Talisman.  The Talisman is required to unlock the Crown of Command and pass through the Portal of Power in the Inner World.&#10;&#10;Once players have a Talisman and have enough Strength or Craft to enter the Portal of Power, they will try to enter the Inner World.  There they must face and survive the guardians there, like the Vampire's Tower and Werewolf before claiming the Crown of Command.  Once a player claims the Crown of Command, they can cast the Command Spell, automatically forcing a player to lose a life.  It then becomes a race for the Crown as the other players try to take the player with the Crown down before he finishes them all off.&#10;&#10;Revised using:&#10;&#10;    Talisman: Upgrade Pack&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "In an ancient world forgotten by time, enormous titans terrorize the land. Five tribes have been fleeing from the titans for centuries, but things are about to change. Growing city-states pledge to end the reign of terror, determined to take on the titans and make the world a safer place for all. Each city-state competes to attract the tribes, eager for the strength of the combined peoples, who are now leaving behind old traditions with the hope that the titans can be defeated once and for all.&#10;&#10;In The Ancient World, players compete to grow the largest and most influential city-state by managing citizens, treasury, and military and by defeating titans. Players take turns sending citizens to take special actions or using military cards to attack titans. One of the actions a citizen can perform is to build Empire cards, which give more citizens, money, and abilities.&#10;&#10;A city-state's influence in the world is measured by sets of tribe banners that it owns. Each Empire card has one or more tribe banners, and tribe banners can also be gained by defeating titans. Players gain victory points (VPs) for sets of tribe banners. After six rounds, the player with the most VPs from sets of tribe banners wins.&#10;&#10;",

Before the game begins, each player looks at several cards featuring famous historical or fictional characters and chooses some of them. Each player's cards are shuffled to form a deck, and this deck is used for each of the game's three rounds.&#10;&#10;In each round, team members take turns trying to get their teammates to guess as many names as possible in 30 seconds. In round 1, almost any kind of clue is allowed, and the cluegiver cannot pass on a card. In round 2, no more than one word can be used in each clue (but unlimited sounds and gestures are permitted); the cluegiver can pass on any card he likes, and the teammates can give only a single answer. In round 3, the cluegiver can use no words at all and can pass as often as he likes; again, teammates are allowed only a single guess. Give good physical clues in round 1, and they'll pay dividends down the road when you need to keep your mouth shut and gesture like a maniac before time's up!&#10;&#10;",

The katanas have always been fundamental for the outcome of the battles that have elected or overthrown the noble and powerful families that dominate the different regions. But behind these beautiful masterpieces, lies a millenary art made of technique,discipline and sweat poured into the most ancient forges scattered around Japan. The smiths masters, keepers of ancient secrets, have the fate of entire families and the history of their country in their hands. Now it&rsquo;s up to you, you have been called to carry on this ancient tradition. Will you beable to offer your masterpieces to the most powerful Daimyo in Japan and even tothe Shogun himself?&#10;&#10;Shogun no Katana is a strategic Eurogame that will transport you to the magical atmosphere of feudal Japan. Use your workers to choose which swords to make, among those requested by the powerful local Daimyo. Collect resources to improve your craft, and request your artists to create breathtaking decorations. Have your family members admitted to the most strategic rooms of the Shogun&rsquo;s palace to obtain the privileges of their rank. And finally, create the most beautiful SHOGUN NO KATANA!&#10;&#10;You will have to manage your Forge wisely, as crafting Katanas will be the real beating heart of the game. The original and innovative sword-making mechanism allows you to activate an entire row or column to work on different Katanas at the same time.  Each player has its own forge where all the katana crafting will take place.&#10;&#10;During the game you will obtain resources, either by visiting the market, the palace among other places. By activating a row or column you can add resources to all matching Katanas, moving them accordingly on the grid. But be careful! Having a lot of Katanas on the grid means that you can accomplish more with fewer actions, but it also increases the risk of them hindering each other. You will have to build your engine cleverly to maximize your turns.&#10;&#10;",

The Allied player must rush his ground forces forward as fast as possible to relieve his beleaguered airborne divisions and capture a bridge across the Rhine.&#10;&#10;The scale of the map is 2 kilometers per hex and covers the battlefield from the Belgian border to Arnhem. The map also includes the area where the British 8th Corps fought on the right flank of 30th Corps.&#10;&#10;Most units in Holland &lsquo;44 are battalions, but units range from Company to Brigades.&#10;&#10;Holland '44 uses a system very similar to Ardennes '44: The Battle of the Bulge.

    "description": "(from the designer and GMT Games website:)&#10;&#10;Unconditional Surrender! World War 2 in Europe (USE) is a strategic level game covering the World War II European Theater. Players make the political decisions and control the military forces of the three major factions that struggled for European dominance and survival.&#10;&#10;With its emphasis on force projection and decision making, players remain focused on the big picture of managing their front lines and political opportunities. Through simple mechanics and low on-map counter density, players easily handle the strategic action without a myriad of complicated subsystems or tall stacks of counters.&#10;&#10;As one gamer put it, &quot;It is a delight to be spending my limited brain power on making (or agonizing over) operational decisions that are as dependent upon guts as they are gray matter. This game is not a series of arithmetic exercises, and the only variable in these algorithms is nerve.&quot;&#10;&#10;Though the focus is on the big picture, Unconditional Surrender! still delivers historical detail. Each country has an historical army level order of battle, and its relative economic strength and national will to fight are effectively and simply modeled. Also represented are such World War II events as airdrops, Free Forces, jets, naval evacuation, partisans, radar, railroad artillery guns, and ULTRA; all neatly woven into the game's core mechanics for ease of play&#10;&#10;The game has many scenarios ranging from quick playing individual campaigns to longer ones covering up to the entire war.&#10;&#10;Design Highlights&#10;&#10;     Scale: army, fleet, or air wing level units; 30-60 miles per hex; monthly turns &#10;     Players: 2-4&#10;     Playing Time: 30 minutes to 50 hours, depending on the scenario&#10;     Low On-Map Counter Density: The number of counters on the map is relatively low.&#10;     Simple Stacking: No more than one air, ground, convoy, or warship unit per hex.&#10;     No Factors on Counters: There are no combat or movement factors on counters.&#10;     Single Combat System: One combat resolution sequence and Combat Results Table covers all types of combat, yet the results differ for air/naval, ground, or strategic combat. &#10;     Integrated Movement/Combat System: Units move and fight in a combined activation. &#10;     &quot;Use it or Lose it&quot; Economic System: Simple math with minimal record keeping&#10;     Historical or Variable Entry: Units and events can enter play using an historical or variable time line. &#10;     Variable Politics: Most countries&rsquo; belligerence and faction alliance is not predetermined.&#10;     Solitaire Friendly: Though not designed with solitaire rules, the mechanics easily allow one player to play the game.&#10;     PBEM Capable: The game can be played using PBEM software, but its mechanics require frequent exchanges.&#10;&#10;&#10;TIME SCALE:    Monthly Turns&#10;MAP SCALE:     30 to 40 miles per hex&#10;UNIT SCALE:     Army, Fleet or Wing&#10;&#10;DESIGNER: Salvatore Vasta&#10;DEVELOPER: Mark Dey&#10;MAP ART: Salvatore Vasta &amp; Mark Simonitch&#10;COUNTER ART: Charlie Kibler&#10;&#10;",

The winter is coming, and in a few days, those who cannot get on board will be doomed by the ice. It will be a race against time to arrive at the ship or surrender to despair: there's still the light of hope on the horizon, a light to grab before it's too late...&#10;&#10;'Last Aurora' is a post-apocalyptic game for 1-4 players set in a frozen, desolate land. Each player has to manage their crew to gather resources, recruit survivors, improve their vehicle, and fight their enemies as they race to reach the ship before it's too late!&#10;&#10;2021 Seal of Excellence by Dice Tower&#10;&#10;",

Just remember that Madness brings you power but at a price (joking!).&#10;&#10;If you're ready to embrace the creatures beyond the understanding of mortal men, then shuffle up these guys with your pirates, bear cavalry, and others for the most awesome fit of crazed insanity you've had in a long time!&#10;&#10;",

Each card depicts a historical event on both sides, with the year in which that event occurred on only one side. Players take turns placing a card from their hand in a row on the table. After placing the card, the player reveals the date on it. If the card was placed correctly with the date in chronological order with all other cards on the table, the card stays in place; otherwise the card is removed from play and the player takes another card from the deck.&#10;&#10;The first player to get rid of all his cards by placing them correctly wins. If multiple players go out in the same round, then everyone else is eliminated from play and each of those players are dealt one more card for another round of play. If only one player has no cards after a bonus round, he wins; otherwise play continues until a single player goes out.&#10;&#10;Timeline: Music &amp; Cinema can be combined with any other title in the Timeline series.&#10;&#10;",

Tiles that have been flipped cannot move again, and once all tiles have moved, the game ends with a scoring round. First, tiles adjacent to bush fires are removed if they depict as many animals as the number of fires (1, 2, or 3) on the bush-fire space. Score for each grass and tree uncovered on your board. Finally, score for each of the six animal species; the bigger the main herd of each of species and the more water holes it contains, the more points you score, e.g. a herd of five rhinos and three watering holes is worth (5x3) 15 points. The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;Savannah Park includes a solo mode, a set-up variant that allows you to place the bush fires and trees where you wish, and a scoring variant that rewards you for bumping a lion out of the animals' way.&#10;&#10;",

Then additional cards are added as Belratti's fakes. All cards are shuffled upside down, then flipped up. The buyers then have to select all the cards from the painters, not the fake cards by Belratti.&#10;&#10;The roles change after each round. If too many fakes are bought, the players lose.&#10;&#10;(The name of the game is obviously derived from the name of  the German art forger W. Beltracchi)&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "When Alexander the Great died in 323 BC, he left no clear heir to the immense empire he had conquered. It was not long after his death that the Macedonian generals began to war among themselves over who would be the regent or successor to Alexander's empire. By 305 BC they had given up on succession and began to carve out their own kingdoms. Successors III is a four-player game based on those wars.&#10;&#10;Successors was first published in 1997 by Avalon Hill. Some years later a second edition rulebook was published that gave more options for the Tyche cards. Successors III builds on the foundation of the Successors II rules set plus expansion cards that appeared in the Boardgamer. Minor refinements have been made to make the game easier to play and increase enjoyment. The map is very similar to the original with some minor changes around Macedonia. Counters have the same excellent artwork for the generals and new GMT artwork for the combat units and control markers. The Tyche cards have received the most changes&mdash;nearly every card has had some minor modifications and a few new cards have been added.&#10;&#10;In addition to the changes, the rules have been cleaned up and improved. Years of questions and answers on Consimworld have been used to clarify the rules. The rules also include hints on strategy from a number of long-time Successors players, and an extended example of play.&#10;&#10;",

They turned you into a highly trained cyber-agent, but it didn&rsquo;t take you long to figure out that your bosses cared much more about their profit than about justice for ordinary people. You turned in your badge and now you live in a tiny apartment in a bad neighborhood, stripped of most of your cybernetic implants. It doesn&rsquo;t matter though, as you can finally do what a Lavel is meant to do: solve crimes and help those who can&rsquo;t count on anyone else in this merciless world.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;In the standalone game Chronicles of Crime: 2400, you can use all the latest technology to solve crimes. Your pet Cyber-Raven can analyze evidence and search the web to find information on suspects. During the course of a scenario, you may also obtain cybernetic implants that would increase your abilities. Super-senses that help you find evidence on the crime scene? A tomograph to quickly check the person you&rsquo;re talking to for cyber enhancements? Or maybe a zapper to quickly neutralize any electronic device? The future is full of useful stuff!&#10;&#10;Be careful though, as the technology is not always on your side! Is the character you&rsquo;re talking to a human or an android? Who&rsquo;s hiding behind the avatars you meet in the virtual cyberspace locations? The struggle between criminals and detectives is millennia old, but at the beginning of the 25th century, it&rsquo;s been taken to a whole new level.&#10;&#10;Welcome to Paris in the year 2400! Technology has taken a giant leap forward: androids, indistinguishable from humans, walk the streets, and having cybernetic implants has slowly become the norm. Artificial intelligence plays a major role in everyone&rsquo;s daily life and, for many, Cyberspace has become a world as important as the real one.&#10;&#10;The landscape of Paris is now dominated by a gargantuan translucent Dome covering half a district. Under it, there&rsquo;s a private city on its own, created and ruled by BelCor. Only the rich and privileged can live there and enjoy comfortable houses, unlimited access to water, clean air and controlled temperature.&#10;&#10;Uneven access to new technologies, and a host of other inequalities, fuel social unrest which often turns into open violence. Paris has become a popular destination for people from regions that suffered catastrophic droughts, epidemics, and wars. It isn&rsquo;t, however, a promised land, but a merciless world where the constant fight for influence takes place on every level, from big international corporations, through political extremist groups to ordinary street gangs.&#10;&#10;Part of Chronicles of Crime - The Millennium Series&#10;Chronicles of Crime is back with a range of games called &quot;The Millennium Series&quot;. Three brand new standalone Chronicles of Crime games, working with the same great system but providing interesting gameplay twists and refreshing universes that span an entire millennium from 1400 to 1900 and finally 2400. All three games are standalone but will offer connecting narrative threads for players to discover.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

The Government, representing both the colonial authorities and France&rsquo;s military leadership, must engage the nationalist insurgency decisively while striving to preserve the support and commitment of the civilian government and society.

You must carefully consider  just what it is you want to do, and how much of it, before the initiative slips from your fingers.&#10;&#10;It also includes rules for a solitaire FLN bot AI opponent.

    "description": "An iconic major league baseball game that is so well known that it is exhibited in the National Baseball Hall of Fame. The game is conducted with pitcher and batter cards constructed with statistical probabilities so they realistically reproduce the real-life performance of each player for the season represented.  The gamer is placed in the role of the manager and/or general manager of a team and controls the batting order, the choice of a starting pitcher, game strategies (hit and run, steals, intentional walks, bunting, positioning of infielders, pinch hitters, defensive substitutions, pitching changes, etc.).  If a full season is played, the game produces amazingly realistic statistics at the player, team, and league levels.  The game comes in two versions: a cards and dice version that has been around since 1962 and a computer version that automatically looks up play outcomes and compiles player, team and league statistics.  Every year, Strat-O-Matic releases new player card sets based on the previous baseball season, seasons past, and some &quot;greats&quot; collections.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Under a blazing sun in 4th century BCE, traders come from all corners of the Mediterranean Sea to Corinth to sell their goods; Persian carpets, Cretan olive oil, Roman grapes, and Egyptian spices are highly prized by traders. Players have a few weeks to secure their place in Corinthian lore as its most savvy trader!&#10;&#10;Corinth is a roll-and-write game akin to a dice-only version of the board game Yspahan. At the start of a turn, the active player rolls nine dice, then places all the dice with the highest value on the gold space at the top of the chart, then starts placing dice from the bottom of the chart up, with each value of dice being on a separate level.&#10;&#10;The active player takes all the dice on one level, then the action associated with that level. The top level gives the player as many gold as the number of dice they took; the bottom level gives goats instead of gold; and the middle levels allow a player to deliver goods to a number of market stalls on their personal player sheet equal to the dice claimed. (You have four colors of market stalls, and once you start marking off, say, rugs in one of the blue areas, you have to finish marking off all the rugs in that area before you can start marking off another blue area.)&#10;&#10;The active player can spend gold to roll up to three extra yellow dice and thereby increase the odds of getting to take a desired level; if the active player doesn't take any of these yellow dice, they are removed from play, preventing others from benefitting at that player's expense.&#10;&#10;Instead of marking off gold, goats, or goods, you can use the value of the die or dice claimed (1-6) to move the steward on your personal score sheet. The steward starts in the middle of a 5x5 grid on your sheet, and you must move it as many spaces as the number of pips on the die value claimed, not crossing over any line you've drawn previously. You can pay 1 gold to move the steward one more or one fewer space, and you can pay as much gold as you want to do this. You can receive gold, goats, or goods from where the steward stops, but beyond that, you can earn points. When the steward stops on a corner space of this grid, you count the number of spaces circled to this point, with some spaces counting twice, then you write down that number, scoring that many points at game's end. If you stop in another corner later, you do the same thing again, which compounds the value of all your previous movement.&#10;&#10;You can spend gold or goats to construct buildings that give you bonus powers, such as collecting two additional gold whenever you collect any gold or moving the steward up to two spaces more or less without paying.&#10;&#10;After 16 turns (with four players) or 18 turns (with two or three players), the game ends and you tally points for goods delivered, spaces visited by the steward, buildings constructed, and goats and gold still on hand.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "The initial quakes were only minor tremors, but as the land began to unravel, so did our sense of security. We watched the cliffs of Hytazch fall into the sea. Mighty trees of old, swallowed up by the caverns below. As the waters rose, a great roar was heard across the plains. This was no cry of disbelief or heartache, but of jubilance. Songs began to fill the air as our once peaceful hosts, now readied themselves for war. Suddenly on the horizon, what appeared as huge bolts of energy shoot out into the depths of space, before disappearing again. Despite the inevitable shock wave heading our way, the clans continued to cheer as they made haste towards the origin of the blaze. What could cause such elation? Why abandon caution in favour of chaos? Had we missed something - some crucial misunderstanding of this planet and its inhabitants? Upon reaching the site, we were immediately plunged into combat. Across the landscape lay six massive structures, towering over the forces fighting below. They seemed to pulse and flicker with a golden haze. Could these be the ancient relics the Oxataya spoke of? There is so much we still do not understand, but we cannot concede to indecision. Will we stay and fight, or retreat back to Moontide?&#10;&#10;In Circadians: Chaos Order, players take on the role of 1 of 6 asymmetric factions. Each faction has their own means of winning the game, unique leaders, attribute cards and other abilities.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

A worker placement mechanism, using hourglasses as workers allows, but also limits, players to perform a multitude of actions. Each player handles 1 Doctor hourglass running around the hospital, admitting patients, providing immediate medical care, performing different kinds of exams as well as performing surgeries. Additionally, there are 4 more Nurse hourglasses, which can be used by all players. Nurses provide medicines to patients, supply all necessary drugs and equipment that you need to carry out all your exams and medical procedures. Any worker placed on an action space may not be used elsewhere before the sand within the hourglass runs out, making each decision important as time is limited.&#10;&#10;The game plays from 1-4 players and lasts for 4 rounds of 4 minutes each. That means you only have 16 minutes in total to treat various patients, overcome many difficulties and challenges and manage to cooperate efficiently with your teammates, combine your forces into helping as many of your patients.
