The purpose of traveling to different locations is to either build up new or refresh your existing resources. For example, you will visit the Blacksmith for your swords, the Academy for your spell books, the Market for coins, and the Tavern for your hearts. Liquid courage perhaps? There are also 7 other locations in the game, of which you will use one per game. This adds variety to the playing experience as these special locations have a wide range of abilities.&#10;&#10;Once you feel like you have enough resources, you will venture out into the Forest. There you'll encounter a variety of monsters. These monsters will give you points to add to your glory and some of them provide immediate benefits when they are defeated. The first player to gain 20 glory triggers the end game and once all players have had an equal number of turns, the guild leader with the highest glory total is declared the victor!&#10;&#10;Kingswood features an action rotation mechanism that puts players at the heart of the game.&#10;&#10;Each turn you select an adventurer and move them to a new location, taking the actions associated with both the starting and ending locations.&#10;&#10;Since every player controls the same adventurers, your choices change your opponents options on their turn.&#10;&#10;Kingswood: A guilded quest for 1-5 adventurers!&#10;The game is designed by Henry Audubon (Space Park &amp; PARKS) and illustrated by Tristam Rossin (3 Laws of Robotics &amp; Rune).&#10;&#10;",

Each player becomes a master thief about to commit the most daring burglary of his career. During the game players may use unique abilities of their thieves as well as various action cards, which represent maneuvers, alchemical potions or complicated devices inspired by visionary ideas of Renaissance inventors. The players choose cards to play and then use available Action Points to plan the order of their activities. This makes the game very dynamic, with each resolved action dramatically influencing the turn. The players&rsquo; order changes dynamically depending on the number of Action Points placed on each chosen card.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to break into the vault inside the Emperor's palace and steal the Emperors' Jewel, the symbol of power very precious to the ruling dynasty. However, this is hardly the end, because thieves must escape from the city with their loot. This is no easy task - the streets are patrolled by vigilant city guards and veteran captains well versed in all criminal tricks. Additionally, time is running fast for the thieves - event cards introduced each turn control the flow of the game, escalating its pace and difficulty of challenges for the players to overcome.&#10;&#10;The thief who will manage to escape through one of four city gates taking with him the Emperors&rsquo; Jewel or other valuable loot will be the winner of the game. Anyone who will stay inside Hadria after resolving the last event card will be caught and mercilessly thrown inside the city dungeon, their names erased from the annals of the omnipotent Guild.&#10;&#10;",

The options are varied: Get a new ship with new goods into your harbor, close a new contract, change the values of the four different goods, improve your influence card-hand, expand your harbor, buy a new building, or simply rise in the nautical ranks to get more money. But you have to be careful: Every ship and every contract will stay in your harbor only for a short while. (The transporters and trains are waiting!) If you fail to coordinate the incoming and outgoing goods, you might have to pay penalty for not fulfilling a contract!&#10;&#10;Bremerhaven ends after a defined number of rounds, and the rules include both a short version and solo rules.

The aim is to find, through strategic gameplay, a way to &quot;embrace&quot; the other player's king.&#10;&#10;The game represents a constructive conversation or development in which the two sides merge their knowledge, ideas, and strength. During the game, both players try to bring forward good or ever better ideas than the other player by moving their chess pieces around. For both players, the aim is to stand strong for your knowledge, ideas and strength, but you will be open to receive input from the other player when it is their turn. Making the last move and bringing one of your pieces into a union with the other player's King will make you win the game.&#10;&#10;Paco &#197;&#156;ako is played on the same board and with the same chess pieces as traditional/classic chess, though the Paco &#197;&#156;ako chess pieces have a different functionality. Black and white pieces can be merged into a union and can stay together on one square. Because there are no pieces taken, all pieces stay on the board during the game. Once unions are created, both players can still move them; you can take over a union and release your piece out of a union by replacing it with another piece and eventually there is the chain reaction, which really brings out the Paco &#197;&#156;ako gameplay. Taking over unions and releasing pieces mean you may move several pieces in one turn.&#10;&#10;The game is very much focused on patterns and creativity, not on piece advantage. The nice thing about this is that both players stay in the game until the last move is made. There can be created an advantage in position and games can be fast because of the dynamics and physical patterns in which several pieces can be moved in one go. When the game develops into an endgame with a lot of unions, there will be a high energy on the board with lots of possibilities, chains and creative options, and often both players will get closer to making the final move. Sometimes it is about having momentum and holding it.&#10;&#10;",

In this game you start at 221B and travel through the streets and alleys of London picking up clues and attempting to solve the most intriguing cases Holmes and Watson have ever faced.&#10;&#10;Each player assumes the role of Holmes and matches wits with the other players to determine who possesses the most skillful powers of deduction.  Each case is represented by a card that features a crime told in story form, a selection of probable suspects and a list of locations involved in that crime. Clues are hidden throughout London, one in each of fourteen locations. Players must collect clues from each location, noting them down on their checklists as they attempt to find the answers to the questions listed on the case card.&#10;&#10;Naturally, the crime scene will often contain vital clues, and a prudent detective always checks with the neighbors. Still, you can learn something vital almost anywhere in town.  The first player to figure out the correct answers to a particular mystery or crime, return to 221B and announce the solution, is the winner.&#10;&#10;The original 221B Baker Street Board game was created and copyrighted by American writer Jay Moriarty (dba Antler Productions) in 1975.

During the next three months, the Germans will reel from successive Soviet hammer blows, try in vain to relieve the 6th Army, and fail to supply it from the air. The 6th Army surrenders, and only the counter-attack by von Manstein&rsquo;s panzers stop the red tide. The turning point of World War II in Europe has passed.&#10;&#10;Enemy at the Gates, the second Operational Combat Series release by The Gamers, offers players different challenges from those in the very popular game Guderian&rsquo;s Blitzkrieg. The Soviet army has rearmed and reorganized their Tank Corps &ndash; their challenge to the Panzer Divisions. The unique force structures of each side force players to fight differently in order to maximize their strengths. And, of course, players must face the toughest operation and strategic choices they have ever faced. When to stand, when to run&hellip;and when to strike.&#10;&#10;Enemy at the Gates covers the entire period from 19 November 1942 to mid-March 1943. There are numerous one and two map scenarios. The game covers Operation Uranus, Operation Little Saturn, the German Relief and airlift efforts, and Operation Star and Gallup (to include von Manstein&rsquo;s famous &ldquo;backhand blow&rdquo;).&#10;&#10;Extensively researched, playtested, and developed, Enemy at the Gates will satisfy the Eastern Front interest of any gamer who wants to know more than the pulp-history version of these pivotal events!&#10;&#10;Features:&#10;&#10;    Dynamic and fluid situation&#10;    All of the pivotal battles in AG South&#10;    The creation of the Stalingrad pocket&#10;    The relief effort and airlift&#10;    Mansteins famous Backhand Blow!&#10;    Follow-on to the popular Guderian's Blitzkrieg: The Drive on Moscow game and system- refined based on player feedback&#10;    Player skill is highly rewarded&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;&#10;    Turn: Half-week&#10;    Hex: 5 miles / 8 Km&#10;    Units: Battalion to Army&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;&#10;    Four 22 x 34&quot; maps (Maps A, B, C &amp; D)&#10;    One 8 x 11&quot; Stalingrad 'Blow-Up' map&#10;    Eight dual-side printed countersheets (5 combat, 3 markers - 2,800 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;    One 36-page OCS rules booklet&#10;    One 36-page Enemy at the Gate game specific rules booklet&#10;    Two 6-page OCS version 2.0 Charts &amp; Tables Folders&#10;    Four Player Aid cards&#10;    Two 6-sided dice&#10;&#10;&#10;Complexity: High&#10;Solitaire Suitability: High&#10;Playing Time: 4-100 hours&#10;Players: 1 or more&#10;&#10;(from the Game Box)&#10;&#10;&#10;All 4 maps were changed and reprinted in 2001.&#10;Updated and replaced by Case Blue.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "No stacks of armies, no hexes, no overly-lengthy rules to learn - Hitler&rsquo;s Reich takes five minutes to set up and two hours (or less!) to play. Players fight over Europe, across the North Atlantic and Mediterranean and into Russia using a combat mechanism similar to the traditional card game &ldquo;War&rdquo; with dice added in.  High-quality wooden pieces mark their progress, which is aided economically, politically and on the battlefield through the competition for and play of Event Cards drawn from three unique decks: one for the Axis, one for the Allies, and one from which either side can attempt to draw.&#10;&#10;Hitler&rsquo;s Reich is the first of the Card Conquest System game series in which players recreate epic military contests of history in short, comparatively simple and easy to learn, but hard to master games.  Designed to be set up in minutes and played to conclusion in one sitting, these are not simulations but games, albeit ones packed with enough historical flavor, excitement, and decision making to give you the feeling of being there at the highest levels of command.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "The Barracks Emperors is a strategy card game set against the backdrop of the Roman Crisis of the Third Century, during which at least 45 different men made a claim to the throne of the Roman Empire.  In this game, 1-4 players represent prominent political factions attempting to gain control over the men who would be Emperors of Rome.  Players deploy the influence available to them (represented by the cards in their hands) to claim imperial reigns (represented by the historical Emperor cards arrayed on the board.)   But they must be very careful, because politics is a complex game, and sometimes attempting to exert your influence necessitates aiding someone else in their own plots.  Play your cards cleverly to capture Emperors and score the most points to win.&#10;&#10;At its heart, The Barracks Emperors is a trick-taking game, but not one like you&rsquo;ve ever seen before. In this innovative design, all 13 tricks are available for play simultaneously, in an interlocking grid that forces you to balance the value of every card you play against the value that same card may have for another player on a different trick.  Plus, every card grants you an additional special ability that you might be able to use to spring a surprise on your unwitting opponents.&#10;&#10;Features:&#10;Historical emperors, co-emperors, pretenders, and even Gallic Emperors who broke away from Rome during the Crisis of the Third Century are all represented as individual cards in the game, each with interesting facts about the rise and demise of the man depicted.&#10;&#10;For fans of Time of Crisis: The Roman Empire in Turmoil, 235-284 AD and Time of Crisis: The Age of Iron and Rust, you will find some of the concepts and flavor from that deck-building wargame, adapted in this all new standalone game.  You don&rsquo;t need Time of Crisis to play The Barracks Emperors, but you&rsquo;ll recognize Influence Cards such as Praetorian Guard, Foederati, and Pretender, now used in an entirely new way.&#10;&#10;An innovative card drafting mechanic adds an extra layer of strategy to how you play your cards while also mitigating the luck that would come with being dealt a full hand of cards at the start of each round.&#10;&#10;This game is designed for 4 players, but also includes options for 2 or 3 players, plus an easy-to-play solitaire adaptation for the solo player.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Longstreet Attacks: The Second Day at Gettysburg is a two-player Tactical level  board-wargame simulating the fighting on July 2nd, 1863 during the second day of the Battle of Gettysburg and focuses on the southern portion of the battlefield. These engagements involved General Longstreet&rsquo;s attack against Sickles&rsquo; positions, with troops from Hood&rsquo;s and McLaws&rsquo; Divisions, assisted as well by Anderson&rsquo;s Division of A.P. Hill&rsquo;s Corps.&#10;&#10;The game is specifically designed to be a playable regimental-scale game that players can complete in a long evening. It allows the players the immersive experience of tactical combat without the heavy rules overhead normally found in such games, while also delivering a comprehensive experience of limited intelligence and unexpected events. The game features the Blind Swords chit-pull system which emphasizes the three &ldquo;FOW&rsquo;s&rdquo; of military conflict: fog-of-war, friction-of-war and fortunes-of-war. With each chit pull, players will be challenged to make tough decisions based on their assessment of the situation at that moment. Unlike traditional chit-pull systems, the Blind Swords system ensures that no combat units can be counted on, or conversely, counted out. This yields an environment of tense action and constant surprises &ndash; an environment that will challenge each player.&#10;&#10;UNITS&#10;&#10;All regiments and batteries of the Army of Northern Virginia and the Army of the Potomac that took part in these actions are represented in the Order of Battle. Each unit has a Strength Point number, with each point equaling 50 men or 1 artillery piece, and a Cohesion Rating, representing the unit&rsquo;s morale, training and experience.&#10;&#10;SYSTEM HIGHLIGHTS&#10;&#10;Combat and Cohesion System: The combat system is &ldquo;firepower&rdquo; based and utilizes the unit&rsquo;s size and Cohesion Rating to determine its effectiveness. The combat system is driven by a unique four-D6 dice mechanic. All four differently-colored dice are rolled simultaneously. The black and white dice generate an initial result ranging from 11 to 66. The other two dice (red and blue) simultaneously give the players the tangible effect of the initial result and represent physical casualties suffered by the unit (the red die) and the morale effect of the enemy&rsquo;s fire (the blue die).&#10;&#10;Orders System: A player must first choose one of four possible Orders that an activated Brigade will operate under &ndash; Attack, Defend, Maneuver or Rally. Each Order has specific parameters that provide benefits and restrictions. This Order choice can be critical to a unit&rsquo;s performance during its activation.&#10;&#10;Chit-Pull System: The Blind Swords chit-pull system is a unique mechanic and generates challenging actions and difficult decisions for the players. It features four different types of chits, all of which reside in the same cup, each with special effects:&#10;&#10;Division Activation Chits. These activate any one Brigade (not yet activated) from the Division listed on the chit. However, further Brigade activations from this Division are dependent on the Division General&rsquo;s Command Rating and a die roll. A successful die roll places the chit back into the cup and thereby the other Brigades of the Division have a chance to activate in the future.  A failed die roll discards the chit for the turn and the remaining Brigades will not be able to activate normally (however, see below). &#10;CIC Chits.  These are a special kind of Activation Chit. The Union player has a Sickles chit and the Confederate player has a Longstreet chit. These chits allow the player to select any one Brigade in the game for activation - even if it has already activated or will be activated later in the turn. Thus, this is the opportunity to activate a Brigade twice in the turn or activate a Brigade from a Division that has lost its Division Activation Chit. &#10;Event Chits.  There are nine Event chits assigned to each player. At the start of each turn, players may select any one of these chits to place in the cup (obviously an Event they really want). Three Event chits are randomly thrown out of the turn and will not be used &ndash; the remaining five Event chits are also then placed into the cup with the previously pre-selected chit. In this manner, players are never assured of drawing any particular Event chit, except for the one they chose. Each Event chit has a Unique Event side (all the chits have a different Event listed) and a Command Event side. The Unique Event is a tactical event that can be used on the battlefield and each Event has specific effects and options for the player to consider. Examples are Rebel Yell!, Union Logistics, Quick March and Heroic Stand. The Command Event side is used for more strategic options. The Union player may call for reinforcements from the rest of the Army of the Potomac (only the III Corps Divisions are available at start) and the Confederate player can attempt to better coordinate his attack (by increasing his Division General&rsquo;s Command Ratings). &#10;Wild Chits.  These are the two &ldquo;chaos&rdquo; chits. One chit is Fog of War, which can possibly cause units from either side to conduct unexpected attacks or withdrawals, or can cause General officer casualties. The other chit is Fortunes of War which will immediately discard the next chit pulled with no effect &ndash; including that special pre-selected Event chit if it happens to come up!&#10; MAP&#10;&#10;The map is 22&rdquo; x 34&rdquo; hexagonal map of the entire south end of the Gettysburg battlefield. Each hex equal 150 yards and contains all the significant terrain details &ndash; elevations, slopes, woods, swamps, buildings, orchards, etc.&#10;&#10;SCENARIOS&#10;&#10;The game will include at least five scenarios:&#10;&#10;The Round Tops. A small scenario to introduce people to the games rules.&#10;&#10;The Whirlpool. A ten turn scenario about the most contested part of the battlefield. The Wheatfield, Devils Den, Houck's Ridge and the Peach Orchard. 4:20 to 7:20pm&#10;&#10;Assault on the Emmitsburg Road. A 9 turn scenario of the battle for the Peach Orchard and Cemetery Ridge. 5:40 to 8:20 PM&#10;&#10;Hammerin' Sickles. The full second days action on this part of the field. 14 turns. 4:00 to 8:20 pm.&#10;&#10;Sickles Stays Put. A what if scenario exploring a set up closer to what Meade intended for Sickles before his forward advance.&#10;&#10;Map by Rick Barber&#10;Counters by Charlie Kibler&#10;Box by Mark Mahaffey&#10;&#10;",

Will you be able to outperform the other homesteaders?&#10;&#10;Each player in Nevada City starts the game with a nuclear family &mdash; mother, father, daughter, and son &mdash; and a homestead mat where you can establish farms, fence in livestock, and develop silver mines. You start the game with one mine, one farm, and one ranch, along with some money and an assortment of commodities. The town consists of a few buildings, and other buildings will become available for construction as the years advance, with the game lasting four years.&#10;&#10;A year lasts a number of turns until all players have used all of their characters and hired workers. On a turn, a player chooses one of their characters and takes actions until all of that character's actions are spent; a character can't take the same action during a turn. A character can buy new property from city hall; mine, farm, or ranch their own property; claim a building; construct a building; use an existing building; reserve a contract that has conditions for improving the city; or work to fulfill that contract. Each character and worker has a different set of skills that can boost the actions they take, such as finding additional silver in a mine or bringing lumber to a construction site.&#10;&#10;You earn victory points (VPs) for constructing buildings, in addition to fees from those buildings when other players use them. You earn VPs for completing contracts as well, with those contracts having different values depending on which buildings are in place at the time. Each player receives a private goal card at the start of the game, and all players score points for these goal cards based on how well they do relative to other players, so pay attention to their choices.&#10;&#10;Each year, various events pop up, leaving players to suffer drought or reap the benefits of fertile land, among other things. At the end of a year, workers leave unless you marry them into a family, which will require spirits and other resources.&#10;&#10;Nevada City also includes advanced rules that add additional buildings and events to the game, a gambling subgame of sorts, a more volatile production market to make life in the West less predictable, and extra sons and daughters. On top of all that, the unhired workers at the end of a year get rowdy and start shooting up the town, so you need to use your gunslinging abilities to bring them to heel and try to avoid getting wounded since you might lose out on a character's abilities in the subsequent year.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "After the release of Siberia from Reiner Stockhausen and dlp games in 2011, the search for resources &ndash; gas, charcoal, petroleum, diamonds and gold &ndash; in the wilderness of Siberia continues in Siberia: The Card Game with players using investors, salesmen, and workers to extract the most profitable resources.&#10;&#10;Eight resource cards start on the table, with the three leftmost face-up, and resources of the same type must be extracted from left to right. Each player starts with one worker cards on the table and five action cards in hand; an action card shows a combination of one of the five resources and one of the three workers. On a turn, the player first reveals one of the face-down resource cards, then chooses one of the following:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Passes on playing cards and draws two action cards. (A player can hold at most eight cards.)&#10;    Plays two action cards that bear the same symbol, takes the appropriate action (claim a character or extract resources), then draws one action card. (Any two action cards can be used as a joker, but you need at least one symbol of the appropriate type to take an action.)&#10;&#10;&#10;What do the characters do? Each investor has a different resource symbol, and when you extract that resource in the future, you need to play only one card instead of two. The salesman either boosts the value of a particular resource or the value of a character type at the end of the game. The worker allows you extract more resources.&#10;&#10;When you extract resources, you take one card from the resource row (starting at the left) for each worker you have in front of you, then replace those cards with face-down cards from the resource deck. When the last resource card is revealed, each player takes on final turn, then they tally their scores, scoring $1,000 for each character and the printed value for each resource card (unless a salesman modifies those values). The player with the highest total wins!&#10;&#10;The five salesman cards in Siberia: The Card Game can be used as an expansion for Siberia, and rules for this expansion are included.&#10;&#10;Expands (while also being a standalone game)&#10;&#10;&#10;    Siberia&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "The Portuguese King has called the finest stonemasons of the country to pave one of the most important squares with cal&ccedil;ada tiles (worldwide famous black and white tiles that pave several squares in Portugal). But the task is enormous and players will have to count with the aid of helper cards who will help them score points and/or collect money.&#10;&#10;In Rossio, players start the game by drawing five cards and keeping three of them on their hands.&#10;&#10;On a player's turn, players will first recruit a card from their hands, placing it on the rightmost space under their player board, sliding to the left all cards previously recruited, discarding the card that slides off their boards (under each player board there are only 3 card slots). If the newly recruited card is played face-up, players must pay its cost in coins. If the card is played face-down, no money needs to be spent.&#10;&#10;Then, ALL cards under a player board will activate: face-up cards will give the player Points for each time the pattern depicted on the card is found on the square. Face-down cards will provide the player 1 coin each.&#10;&#10;Then, players must build the leftmost cal&ccedil;ada tile of their player boards. Players can never voluntarily change the order of the tiles on their board. At any moment players can, however, spend 1 coin to swap 2 pieces on their board that are orthogonally adjacent. The tile must be built in the square orthogonally adjacent to at least 2 elements: 1 tile and 1 wall, or 2 tiles. And must be built on the leftmost available space of the line it is being built. If the players manage to build orthogonally adjacent to a similar tile, they can as bonus build the next leftmost tile, and so on, until they decide to stop or until they can't build more. Players collect then 1 coin for each coin depicted on the spaces that were left free on their player boards after tiles were built.&#10;&#10;Finally, players end their turn by drawing 1 card into their hand from the 4 cards available on the market. However, the amount of cards players can choose from depends on the number of tiles that they have built. So, if players build only 1 tile, they must take the 1st card. If they build 3 tiles, for example, they can choose between the 1st, 2nd or 3rd cards. Players end their turns by refilling the empty spaces of their player boards with tiles from the facedown stacks.&#10;&#10;As the square is being cooperatively built, certain patterns appear more often than others and the scoring of face-up cards becomes exponential. Also, when players complete a column, they collect a bonus, that can be either 1 coin or drawing more cards. Money is very tight in this game, so gaining an extra coin can be crucial to recruiting a card from your hand face-up.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the square is finished and the player with most points wins the game.&#10;&#10;Rossio is all about timing: Recruit a card face-up late in the game, and then it will score fewer times than expected. Recruit it too early, and it will score you a few points since there are few tiles built on the square. To many cards recruited face down will give that extra amount of money, but, they won't score any points. Build several tiles and you're probably helping your opponents. Build fewer tiles and you probably won't have money next turn to recruit a face-up card.&#10;&#10;Rossio is a game with very simple rules, but with high interaction between players and interesting decisions every single turn.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

To become the Necromancer King, you have to master dark magic, raise an army of undead minions, explore festering dungeons, and research ancient artifacts and spells.&#10;&#10;Rise of the Necromancers is an evil strategy game for 2-5 players, in which each player controls a Necromancer struggling for absolute dominance. Rise of the Necromancers is based on a classic fantasy narrative with character development as well as territorial strategy. The objective of the game is to develop your Necromancer and take control of the lands. Each player starts out as an aspiring Necromancer who can study spells, craft artifacts and eventually graduate from one of four academies. In time, your Necromancer can attract their own apprentice and assemble an undead army of minions to rule the lands.&#10;&#10;Your Necromancer can venture into dungeons where they will encounter wonders and dangerous creatures &mdash; and perhaps meet new companions. In the end, your Necromancer might be able to return to their academy and become Headmaster &mdash; or even seize the foulest of thrones as the Necromancer King.&#10;&#10;Each player moves their miniature Necromancer around the game board to gather resources, spells and artifacts, enter dungeons, battle cities and fight rival Necromancers. Throughout the game, Necromancers can increase their combat and movement abilities as they amass their armies. A Necromancer's minions can also be left behind to protect conquered cities and dungeons.&#10;&#10;In addition to the game's territorial component, the players compete in collecting spells, artifacts and minions affiliated with the four academies. Enough elements of the same color can make you Headmaster of an academy. The game has a varying starting set-up, so no two games are ever the same.&#10;&#10;",

Through a bizarre twist of fate, a branch of the military has decided to focus all its firepower on the other monsters. While your rivals are busy trampling tanks and swatting fighter jets, you'll be out there growing in power and infamy - getting ready for the Monster Challenge. In the end, when the dust settles and the radiation fades, the last creature standing will be crowned King of the Giant Monsters!&#10;&#10;Each player is one of six Giant Monsters, stomping across a map of the USA in search of cities to destroy. The monsters run the gamut from the classic (enormous lizards and gargantuan apes) to the slightly more unconventional (giant walking eyeball), and each has its own set of attributes and powers.&#10;&#10;Ingeniously, everyone also controls an arm of the military, which can be used to attack and weaken the other monsters on the board. It's a losing battle for the militia -- monsters can wipe out military bases and reduce the total number of forces available to each player -- but you can get a few good licks in early in the game.The battle escalates until the 20th city is reduced to rubble. At that time, all the monsters duke it out in a free-for-all, mano-a-clawo Monster Challenge; when the dust settles, the last monster standing is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;This game is a reworking of Monsters Ravage America.&#10;&#10;Key differences between this version and the original game include: getting rid of money in favor of a set number of units each turn, streamlined combat (two rounds in the new edition as opposed to three), removal of &quot;bad&quot; cards from the Research and Mutation decks (along with a few new cards from some of the unofficial expansions), removal of terrain effects on the board, miscellaneous balance tweaks between the military branches and the monsters.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Designed to be an educational and challenging game in which players compete primarily with Nature and with each other, luck tends to be an element in the game, but can be overcome by careful play. Because the situation is forever changing, there is no single best strategy; however,players must weigh risks against gains with every decision they make and good judgment will pay off.&#10;&#10;The game is played on a mapboard showing Africa from Khartoum to Capetown and Lagos to Mombasa. The periphery of this map, showing the territory known ca. 1820, is filled-in; the center is blank. A hexagonal grid is superimposed on the map to regulate movement and to delimit territory explored. In the course of play, each player moves a token (representing his explorer) from explored hexagons to blank hexagons one at a time.; terrain, native tribes and other discoveries within the hexagons are then semi-randomly determined, with allowance made for previous discoveries in adjacent hexagons. The player interacts with the discoveries (e.g. negotiates with new natives for guides) and records them on the mapboard using wax crayons. The mapboard surface is erasable. If the explorer dies before returning to Europe to publish his discoveries, all hexagons which only he has explored will be erased and &quot;subsequent explorers will find that his discoveries were only rumors&quot;; i.e., when other players explore the erased hexagons later they will have to generate new discoveries there.&#10;&#10;When explorers do return to civilization, however, they may publish their discoveries, after which they are safe from erasure. Players may also emulate real explorers by withholding some of their discoveries since they will enjoy some advantages when moving through terrain or dealing with natives known only to them. Points are scored for discoveries as they are published and once scored will not be lost if the explorer dies or is retired by his player. A player may retire his explorer at any time and then start a new explorer in Europe.&#10;&#10;Before each trip to Africa, explorers will have to raise money to support their expedition. New explorers with no discoveries to their credit must do this by drawing chance cards for several turns until they feel their finances are adequate. Experienced explorers can accelerate this process by publishing discoveries, which allow them to draw additional chance cards.&#10;&#10;Originally published by Discovery Games and re-published by Avalon Hill as a more card-based rather than dice-based system. A form of the original rules are preserved in the AH rules book under the rubric &quot;Game II&quot;.&#10;&#10;The rules to the AH version have a serious glitch in sections 12.61 - 12.63 where the die roll modifiers for guides and proceeding cautiously are reversed.&#10;&#10;The GENERAL Index  Article List:&#10;&#10;    The GENERAL Vol.18,No.6&#10;        Source of the Nile &ndash; &ldquo;Native Policy in Source of the Nile&rdquo; (Strategy) Michael Anchors&#10;        The Question Box - Source of the Nile&#10;    &#10;    The General Vol.21,No.3&#10;        &quot;Source of Strength&quot; (Variant)Source of the Nile With A Vengeance, Tim Williams&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;Online Play&#10;&#10;     amarriner.com (PBEM)&#10;&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Source of the Nile: Tributary (Discovery Games version)&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Behind them lie the remnants of the Soviet Western Front -- almost a million men in four armies. The Soviets are stunned by the German Blitzkrieg. Their responses are slow, confused, and governed by pre-war contingency plans made obsolete by the speed of the German advance. In little more than a week, the German panzer spearheads meet east of Minsk.

Entire armies are dispatched from other parts of the Soviet Union as the true scope of the Minsk pocket disaster and the magnitude of the German threat become known. Soviet counterattacks, especially around Lepel, are thrown back with horrific losses. Once again the Panzer Groups charge eastward, creating yet another huge Soviet pocket west of Smolensk.

The system encompasses (as of 6/2001) Barbarossa: Army Group North (2000), Barbarossa: Army Group Center (1998), and Barbarossa: Army Group South (1996). Typhoon! (1995) is the progenitor of these games, and its system is quite similar, but it is unfortunately subtly incompatible with the later games.&#10;&#10;While not simple, these games are also not overly complex and present an excellent simulation of the early war. Most of the details of the campaigns are covered in a playable manner. Perhaps the most obviously interesting detail is the sequence of play, which is asymmetrical to account for the difficulties the Soviets labored under. Make no mistake, the Soviets are going to take a lot of abuse, but this is no walkover for the Germans and both sides are interesting to play.&#10;&#10;(BGG user description)&#10;&#10;&#10;Errata counters contained in Barbarossa: Crimea.&#10;&#10;",

They praise their king Balor, who reigns from his fortifications in the north with an iron fist. Old paths and ruins spread over the island's face, which will be called Ireland many generations from now. But new tribes arrive at the island striving for permanent presence. Who will control &Eacute;rin's fate over the next centuries to come?&#10;&#10;Each player in The Arrival represents a tribe leader who tries to gain predominance over the mythical island of &Eacute;rin while pushing back the demon-like Fomori. But the players are facing a dilemma, for spreading too quickly means becoming more and more corrupt and strengthening the Fomori in their power...&#10;&#10;Over 4-6 rounds, the players determine their resources by means of a unique game mechanism, which will be used later on profitably. During a first phase (Earning Phase), players draw four cards, each showing three sections of different resources. Two of these sections are gradually blocked by the player, thus leaving one section. The resources shown on this section are the ones the player gets. During this phase, they have to decide which section is the best one; while the upper section of the cards offers many resources, it also results in unwanted Corruption Points. The middle and the lower sections offer fewer resources, but also less Corruption.&#10;&#10;After that, the Action Phase takes place and the players must use their resources wisely while having the choice from different kinds of actions in order to get Fame Points.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a certain number of rounds have been played or somebody reaches the corruption limit.&#10;&#10;The winner is either the one with the highest amount of Fame Points or the one with the fewest Corruption Points. This depends on the scene of the board at the end: Do the tribes (players) control more locations on &Eacute;rin than the Fomori do &mdash; or is it the other way around?&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Aquileia, the second most important city of the Roman Empire, had been originally founded as an outpost against the Barbarian invaders. From its military origin comes the peculiar quadrilateral structure divided by the main streets. Later, the city developed to become an important political and cultural center and a prosperous trading city, especially for precious goods, thanks to its convenient and efficient river port. Important monuments such as the Gladiator Arena, the horse-racing Stadium, and the famous theater were built, as well as craftsmen's workshops, patrician villas which completed the architectural network of the city.&#10;&#10;In Aquileia, players want to become the most powerful figure in the city by trading and building. Each player, representing a wealthy Aquileian patrician, owns a certain number of henchmen (pawns) which he uses for these main activities: sports playing, culture, trading, and building. Each activity can bring expenses, earnings and sometimes victory points (VPs).&#10;&#10;Each round begins with a placement phase in which players take turns placing their henchmen on action spaces and their tiebreaker disc on the tiebreaker track. Placing the tiebreaker is mandatory; placing henchmen is not (but you probably want to place them). Once everyone has passed or placed all of their tokens, players resolve the action spaces in numerical order:&#10;&#10;&#10;    The Mercatus allows players to buy weapons, arms and slave cards, collect money through a die roll, claim four blue dice for use with the Arena and Stadium, and trade one currency for another. (This is the only way to make change, and some actions require specific currencies; if you must pay bronze and have only silver and gold, then you cannot take that action!)&#10;    At the Arena, players compare fighting strength, with that number determined by the starting strength on the action space claimed, the roll of three dice and the playing of slave and weapon cards. The winner gets three bronze coins and either double his strength in VPs or a slave card. The second and third best players receive lesser rewards.&#10;    The Stadium is similar to the Arena, with the horse cards coming into play and the winner receiving gold or silver coins and his choice of two laurel cards; laurel cards deliver 3-10 VPs or are a multiplier for endgame scoring.&#10;    The Theatrum brings a bid for a dual-colored laurel card, with players needing to ante and raise in particular currencies. &#10;    In the Forum, players build villas and private banks, sometimes scoring points for doing so when they pay the specific costs with the proper coins.&#10;    Finally, the Portus gives players a chance to activate their buildings, thereby earning them VPs or money.&#10;&#10;&#10;After six rounds, the game ends and players score VPs for their hidden point cards and the product of their villas' values times laurel cards of a matching color. (For example, a total of 8 points of blue villas and three blue villa cards equals 24 points.) The player with the most victory points wins.&#10;&#10;",

Dig the quarry for the best materials, and use them wisely to build your gardens. At the end of the game, the player who unveils the most impressive design before the king will be declared the winner and crowned the greatest architect in the kingdom. Although Babylon is accessible to the whole family, it is also very popular with heavy gamers, due to a large number of optimization possibilities.&#10;&#10;The game box, representing the quarry from which you will draw your construction materials, is placed in the center of the table. On your turn, take a Terrace tile of your choice from the quarry and receive, depending on its location, a variable number of pillars. Use these pillars to place your tile on your personal board and, if you can, beautify your garden with different decorative elements. Build your terraces to go from floor to floor and decorate them as much as possible. At the end of the game, each decorative element will give you victory points depending on the floor where it is located.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Designed to go along with the accompanying 28mm Fantasy Ranges the game features players maneuvering large blocks of miniature soldiers around the battlefield in search of victory.&#10;&#10;Kings of War is a new concept for mass battle miniature wargaming &mdash; a game that is both easy to learn and fast to play! With few and simple rules, there is little to get in the way of the fun and slaughter. Kings of War is a challenging game of strategy, where you can pit your wits against your opponent without devoting half of your brain power to remember a plethora of convoluted rules.&#10;&#10;And that&rsquo;s not all, the innovative turn structure allows you to play Kings of War using a time-keeping tool (like a stopwatch or a chess clock) to time your moves. As the seconds tick away, the pressure and excitement this adds makes 'Kings of War' unlike any other large-scale wargame you&rsquo;ve ever played before.&#10;&#10;Units are given simple ratings such as 'Melee Attack', 'Defense' and 'Nerve' and then augmented with special abilities that characterize the different fantasy races that inhabit the world. In 2015, the &quot;beta&quot; rules were updated and a full ruleset was released. Abbreviated rules are downloadable from Mantic's website, and extracts (about 70%) from the full army lists for all factions are also available for download, called &quot;starter lists&quot;. Currently army lists exist for Elves, Dwarves, Kingdoms of Men (medieval humans), Basileans (clerical army with saints and angels), Forces of Nature (Treemen, Dryads and other assorted forest creatures), Forces of the Abyss (devils and demons), Abyssal (evil) Dwarves, Goblins, Orcs, Ogres, Twilight Kin (evil elves) and the Undead hordes. &#10;Additional factions lists are now available in the &quot;Uncharted Empires&quot; supplement: The Brotherhood (high medieval and mystical humans with elementals), Salamander (humanoid lizards), The Herd (satyrs... ok: beast-men), The League of Rhordia (fantasy renaissance humans and halflings), The Trident Realms of Neritica (tritons/ fishmen), The Empire of Dust (aegyptian undead... yes, kings from tombs), Night-Stalker Armies (spirits, ghosts and the like), Ratkin Armies (ska... er, scavenger ratmen) and the Varangur (chao...tic warriors).&#10;&#10;",

The game&rsquo;s 110 Event Cards grant civilizations great generals, prophets and architects, along with military and commercial advantages ranging from chariots to triremes and from caravans to traders. There are also Events which can inflict plagues and famines, foment civil wars, incur barbarian invasions from all directions of the compass and unleash volcanoes, floods and earthquakes of apocalyptical proportions.&#10; With a very short rule book that lets players get into the game quickly, Ancient Civilizations of the Inner Sea is an exciting, fast-playing, easy-to-learn, easy-to-play but challenging to master and always different abstract game in which player's guide the legendary civilizations that surged and receded around the shores of the Mediterranean: which the Romans aptly called the Mare Internum, or Inner Sea.&#10;&#10;Ancient Civilizations of the Inner Sea is not just one game but many games.

These provide varying economic and strategic value, from 0-5, and with a salt mine in the center, random distribution (with a little tinkering) makes a varied map each game. Players have a village tile which they place on the outer edge, and start with some camels and money. Your turn simply consists of moving and buying camels, expanding your control of the land.&#10;&#10;Targui has very simple mechanisms, and is in effect a simple rolling war game with obvious tactics. But the random turn order creates a wonderful world of rapidly shifting alliances, with players making and breaking promises within moments. The winner is not the one with most money or camels, but with the most economic value under their control.&#10;&#10;The game plays nicely with 3 or 4 players. However, Targui is a long game. Eight rounds takes about three hours, so using the whole deck of 20 fortune cards makes for an over-long game. If you enjoy Risk or light wargaming, then you'll get a lot from Targui.&#10;&#10;",

Each player draws a hand of seven cards, then puts on the best exhibition possible by matching colors and numbers, e.g. red 11, red 1, purple 1, purple 13.&#10;&#10;Each card you play earns you $1, and in turn players can buy cards from the gallery stacks: a 2 costs $2, a 3 $3, etc. Once per turn, you can bury a top card in a gallery stack on the bottom of that stack. If you don't spend all of your money and don't already have a change token, take a change token from the bank; it's worth $1 when you decide to spend it. End your turn by discarding all played cards and cards still in hand, then draw a hand of seven cards, shuffling your discard pile when necessary.&#10;&#10;Six patrons numbered 2-7 are in play, and they give cards additional powers. If you played the most 2s, for example, you have an extra $1 to spend; if you played a 3, you can trash a card from your hand or played area; when you play a 4, you can change either its color or number. Avant Carde includes multiple sets of patrons, and you can use the cards from a single set or mix them.&#10;&#10;Why are you building this collection? To gain awards! If you earn at least $6, you gain an award, and higher amounts net you more awards. Earning $11 is worth four awards, and while you might wonder how you can earn $11, a 7 patron lets you draw additional cards on a turn and a 5 patron lets you earn an extra $1 for each 5.&#10;&#10;When the deck of awards runs out, whoever has collected the most awards wins.&#10;&#10;",

You can write only a single numeral for each round, with no reminders of which animals were which. When the fox card appears, write a numeral showing how many different animals you've seen total. Once during the game, you can circle a number to take a chance on doubling that score.&#10;&#10;Once you've finished the deck after twenty rounds, flip it over, then go through the cards again, this time keeping a public tally of how many animals of each type have been seen. If the number you wrote for a round is equal to or less than the total number of animals seen, you score that many points; if the number is larger, then cross it out and score nothing for that round. For the circled number, if you correctly wrote the exact number of animals, score twice that many points; if you guess higher or lower, score nothing. Whoever scores the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

The round is played similar to the first round in everything else, and the names go back to the container at the end again, for a third round.&#10;&#10;In the third round, no words at all are allowed for the clue giver; only charades and sounds (humming tunes) is allowed.&#10;&#10;The team with the highest total score from the three rounds is the winner.&#10;&#10;The game was packaged commercially as Celebrity and Time's Up! in 1999, and Monikers in 2015.&#10;Also known non-commercially as Salad Bowl or Fish Bowl.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Spring, 1805&#10;Napoleon&rsquo;s Grande Armee&rsquo; is encamped along the shores of the English Channel. Following the teachings of Alexander, the French Emperor seeks to defeat a naval power from the land. He has but to place his 200,000 troops on British soil and France&rsquo;s hereditary enemy will finally fall. To do this, his combined fleet must control the Channel long enough for hundreds of shallow draft boats to ferry his troops to England. Standing in the Emperor&rsquo;s way is the Royal Navy.&#10;&#10;The year 1805, which is punctuated by the British naval victory at Trafalgar, represents one of England&rsquo;s darkest times during the Napoleonic Wars. Her great &ldquo;wooden walls&rdquo; offer the island nation its only defense against a far superior foe.&#10;&#10;1805: Sea of Glory examines the naval war on an operational level during that pivotal year. Although Trafalgar shines through history as the beacon of victory, it is the successful blockade of enemy ports that kept French boats from stepping onto British soil. But 1805: Sea of Glory is more than just a game about blockade duty. It is a game of breakout and pursuit, deception and false leads, husbanding meager resources, striking a blow where your enemy least suspects, and bringing about the decisive battle that defines victory or defeat.&#10;&#10;1805: Sea of Glory focuses on the operational actions of the three great navies. The Allied player (France &amp; Spain) must constantly try to break out of numerous European ports and form a combined fleet. The British player must continuously worry about his ships on station, as wind and weather allow the enemy an opening to slip anchor and set sail. For when Napoleon&rsquo;s fleets take flight, the British are hard pressed to cover all the potential targets and bring the enemy to bear. The British player will find that he never has enough frigates to watch all avenues of escape, and that a clever French player can keep him guessing and ultimately win this game of cat and mouse.&#10;&#10;The game uses blocks to represent the fog of war. The ability to spot and intercept your enemy is paramount. But is that block scurrying across the Mediterranean towards Egypt the French fleet? Or has the Toulon squadron turned west towards the Caribbean? From the French perspective, is the block off the coast of Brest a fleet? Or have the British returned home to repair and refit, leaving only a few frigates to watch the port? Is now the moment to sortie? Or does a large enemy force lay just over the horizon?&#10;&#10;While blocks represent fleets, squadrons, and scouting frigates, traditional counters represent the individual ships of the line. Every ship that could have seen duty, from lowly 64 gunners to the massive Santissima Trinidad, is present. Individual ships are kept on off map organizational charts, so that the exact composition of a fleet or squadron block is not known to your opponent until interception takes place.&#10;&#10;The great naval commanders of the age are present in the game as well. Rosily-Mesros, Villeneuve, Ganteaume, Missiessy, and Gravina for the Allied fleets. Cornwallis, Nelson, Calder, Collingwood, and Strachan for the British. Each admiral is rated for his ability to escape or pursue, as well as, his tactical acumen in combat. Special abilities are also included: from Cornwallis&rsquo; skill as an administrator, to Villeneuve&rsquo;s fatalistic bent, to Gravina&rsquo;s charisma, to Nelson&rsquo;s visionary brilliance brought to life as the &ldquo;Nelson Touch&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;The 22&rdquo; x 34&rdquo; map covers the North Atlantic from the Channel Coast to Africa, and the Mediterranean from the Straits of Gibraltar to Egyptian shores. An insert map covers the West Indies. Each hex represents 50 nautical miles. An Atlantic transit track handles fleets and squadrons sailing from Europe to the Caribbean and back. The major ports of the three belligerents are shown; each rated for harbor facilities and their effect on a fleet&rsquo;s ability to sortie.&#10;&#10;Weather also plays a huge part in the game. Storms and squalls will blow blockading forces off station, allowing the Allied player the opportunity to escape. While at sea, fleets and squadrons are at the mercy of the wind. True to any age of sail game, fleets may become becalmed at the worst possible moment. Prevailing winds are also noted on the map, resulting in interesting strategic options. A player that learns to anticipate and utilize the game&rsquo;s weather system will have the advantage. Beware being caught at sea in the Windward or Leeward Islands during hurricane season.&#10;&#10;Each individual ship is rated for its firepower and morale. The Allied player will cringe as his Spanish ships strike their colors early in a battle, while the steadfast Jack Tars of the Royal Navy will never seem to falter. But despite their superiority at sea, the British are not invincible, and a shrewd French player will find ways to thwart his enemy. Fire high and disable the British so that you can slip away, or stand hull to hull and exchange broadsides?&#10;&#10;A unique tactical combat system rewards fleets that seize the weather gauge. Each player has a selection of tactics chits which represent flag signals sent to his ships during battle. Choose the right combination of maneuver and sail settings to break the enemy line. Take the leeward position and attempt to escape before the windward fleet can close. Or from the leeward, turn and fight, creating a gauntlet of fire an overly aggressive enemy must endure. A Trafalgar sized battle can be fought out in less than 15 minutes.&#10;&#10;Although the game ends immediately in a French victory if the Allied fleet ever controls the English Channel, there is also a set of variable victory conditions. The British Admiralty must watch out for French invasions of Egypt, Malta, Naples, Ireland, or West Indies islands. The British player will quickly learn that he never has enough ships to cover every potential threat.&#10;&#10;A series of random events rounds out the simulation. Napoleon&rsquo;s meddling, British manpower shortages, West Indies fever, Spanish drafts, favorable winds, and Royalist spies are among some of the events that will hinder or help players achieve victory.&#10;&#10;",

Cards are numbered 0-13, with the number showing how many werewolves the character on that card attracts, and each character (number) has a different special power.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you draw the top card of the deck or discard pile, then either discard it to use the power of the card (but only if it came from the deck), discard it without using the power (ditto), or replace one or more of your face-down cards with this card; you can replace multiple cards only if they bear the same number, and you must reveal the cards to prove this, being penalized if you're wrong.&#10;&#10;Silver Dagger contains 14 new roles and abilities not seen in the previous titles, some of which allow you to strategically switch the direction of gameplay, the #4 zombie in particular! As might be expected, zombies are tough to get rid of; in game terms, you can't place them on top of the discard pile, and they need to be face up in order to pass them to the previous player. The game also includes helpful roles such as the debt collector, which subtracts a point for each card held by your opponents, and the halfling, who has the power to divide your entire score for the round in half.&#10;&#10;As in other Silver games, call for a vote when you think you have the fewest werewolves circling your village. Your opponents will then have only one more chance to save themselves &mdash; or to sabotage you!&#10;&#10;The Silver series is made to mix and match! Pick out roles to fill the 0-13 slots from Silver Amulet, Silver Bullet, Silver Coin, or this title to create your very own custom deck.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The top 3 will move clockwise in the Market, one step for each card played. If any commodity would move past 1, it stops at 1. All other commodities move counterclockwise (down) ONE space (but not past the '1' value). Each player adds up the value of the cards they've played. If any commodity has &lt;3 total cards played, those commodities marked with a rose count as double value.&#10;&#10;End of Game Scoring: all hidden cards are revealed and score double their current Market value (ignore roses)&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Set in the Caribbean at a time when pirates have naught to fear but each other, Winds of Plunder allows 3-5 players to compete for Victory Points (VP) by a variety of means: plundering ports, spreading their fierce reputations in the Caribbean isles, finding buried Treasure, and boarding their opponents. Randomly placed VP tiles dictate the value of each port and the location of Treasure Maps, while a unique tile rotation system helps keep game play fresh. Weapons, Crew, and Provisions may also be found in the various ports, each of which confers its own Advantages during the game and translates to VP's in the end. Action cards enhance a player's ability to gain plunder or to forestall his opponents. Wind Cubes permit players to vie over control over the winds that guide movement and the order of play for each game round. But the clock is ticking on the days of easy piracy! The game lasts 9 rounds, or approximately 60-120 minutes.&#10;&#10;All materials are marked &quot;Copyright 2006.&quot; However, the game was not released until May 2007.&#10;&#10;",

For some reason, you've decided that this year will be your big year. You'll explore wonderful habitats on a quest to see as many beautiful birds as you can. But whenever you see a bird, word will get out. Anticipate the crowd to see more birds than anyone else!&#10;&#10;Birds of a Feather is a fast, friendly, easy to learn card game for 1-7 players. The game is easy enough for children to learn and enjoy, but surprisingly strategic, making it a great filler for more hard core gamers.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, each player is dealt a large hand of cards. The game takes place over several rounds. In each round, each player chooses a card to play simultaneously. This determines not only which bird that player sees that round, but which habitat that player visits. Players check off the birds they see on a score sheet, seeing their own bird plus any other birds in the same habitat. Additionally, all birds are available to be seen for an additional round, giving players the opportunity to see rare birds they missed the first time.&#10;&#10;Once all players have played through their hands, scores are tallied based on which birds each player saw. Seeing all birds in a habitat gives a substantial bonus. In the end, whoever saw the widest variety of birds is the winner!&#10;&#10;",

Mechanically, the game employs a familiar card drafting system of picking a card and passing the rest.  The cards are then used according to their type.  Vase cards are placed in a player's shop window.  Flower cards are tucked under the vases, provided they meet the vase's requirements. Basket cards may be hung at the top of a player's window, but only if they can buy the baskets first.  Salary cards provide free income.  Sale cards allow players to sell flowers to put additional funds in their register.  At the game's end, players score points for the best display of flowers in their windows.&#10;&#10;",

In addition to cards in hand, the game includes a common supply of cards, some of which can be added to the tricks to make it easier to reach a player's goal. This strategy might backfire, however, if cards of the wrong color make it into a trick and you're aiming for a low score in that color.&#10;&#10;During each trick, you must follow suit, even with the special trump cards. This also makes it difficult to correctly predict which tricks you'll get. In the end, the player who comes closest to his predictions wins.&#10;&#10;",

The more you attract, the more likely monsters will attack!&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;OverviewHire and train your workers, build and upgrade your attractions, and convince your battle weary heroes to fight just one more time so without letting too many tourists get eaten! Gain Victory points by upgrading attractions and giving Heroes the rest they need. The highest scoring player when all monsters are defeated is the winner.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;SetupEach player begins with a humble resort consisting of a Beach, a Tiki Hut and a small number of Tourists, placed at each attraction. Each player starts with their own worker Deck consisting of 7 Apprentices, 3 Street Performers, and 3 Lazy Peons.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;GameplayEach round consists of 4 phases:&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Phase I - Get to Work&#10;     Each Player draws a hand of 5 Workers from their Worker Deck.&#10;     Players simultaneously send worker cards from their hand to do work at each of their Attractions. Any missing units of work (are required by the Attraction) cause Tourists to leave before gathering resources.&#10;     Players gain the primary resource of Gold by having more tourists at each attraction, and Flair by having less tourists. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Phase II - Action: Attract, Hire &amp; UpgradeIn order, players take one action per turn or pass. Players will be interacting with common draft areas, as well as using abilities from their own workers and attractions. Possible actions include:&#10;&#10;     Attract Tourists from the Dock (Spending Flair) - Tourists are placed at attractions, potentially increasing the Gold gained on the subsequent turn.&#10;     Attract a Hero from the Dock (Spending Flair) - Heroes start with low health, which is gained at the end of each round. Fully Rested Heroes are scored for Victory Points.&#10;     Upgrade an Attraction (Spending Gold) - Providing higher tourist capacity, better Gold payout, better abilities and more Victory Points. Upgraded attractions typically require more workers to keep them fully staffed.&#10;     Train or Hire new Workers (Spending Gold) - Upgrade your workers to provide more work, or better abilities. Training locks a worker draft pile, preventing other players from upgrading to that particular worker during the round. Training workers is a 1-for-1 exchange, keeping players' Worker Deck lean by design. &#10;     Pass - The first Player to Pass becomes the Start Player for the next round&#10;&#10;&#10;Any time during a player's turn, he may use abilities from fully-staffed attractions, or discard worker cards to use their unique abilities.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Phase III - A Ship ArrivesThe dock is refilled with new Heroes and Tourists from a center pile. While refilling, it's possible to trigger a Monster Attack!&#10;&#10;     If an Attack! card is revealed, the top Monster from the Monster Pile will choose which player it's attacking; typically by Most Tourists or Most Heroes at their resort, ties broken clockwise from the start player.&#10;     If a Hero defends against a Monster Attack, he loses 1 health. Any undefended damage causes tourists to be eaten by the Monster.&#10;     Heroes may dodge into, or out of, a Monster Attack up to one time per round.&#10;     If an attraction has no Hero or Tourists, a Monster will Damage it, potentially destroying the attraction.&#10;     A player may chose (if they have one) to throw a Lazy Peon at the monster, ending the attack and permenantly removing the Worker Card from the game.&#10;     The Dock Continues to refill, potentially triggering more Monster Attacks, until it is full.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Phase IV - Clean Up&#10;     Used and unused Workers are placed in players' discard piles.&#10;     Any fully-rested Heroes are scored - Placed to the side, each worth Victory Points at the end of the game. This Hero also removes the top Monster from the remaining Monster Deck.&#10;     Remaining Heroes gain 1 Health each.&#10;     Any Locked Worker Draft Piles and Attraction Abilities are made available for the next round.&#10;     Any unused Flair is sent back to the supply. Gold carries over to the next round.&#10;&#10;&#10;Gameplay continues with Phase I&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Game EndIf at the end of the round  there are no Monsters remaining, the game is over and players total Victory Points from Attractions, Scored Heroes, and 1 point for each remaining Hero at their resort.

    "description": "The original city-building game Big City returns to print in a 20th Anniversary Jumbo Edition with buildings 33% larger than the original game and revised property trading rules.&#10;&#10;In Big City, players acquire cards in eight different neighborhoods, then use them to lay out buildings either one, two, or three spaces large. The points they receive for a given building is a base score, plus bonuses for the buildings surrounding it. Someone must play city hall (scoring no points for themselves) in order for anyone to start placing any structure beyond the simple residences and business. As for what differs from the original game in this new edition:&#10;&#10;&bull; Redevelopment Phase - This new mandatory phase happens at the end of each round of player turns (i.e. after all players have acted). In point order (first to last) each player must surrender one property from their hand, and optionally they can surrender a second property. Then in reverse point order, each player takes back a number of cards equal to the number they surrendered. Cards are normally played face-down so that only the neighborhood is visible. However, a player can &quot;jump to the front of the line&quot; by choosing to play their card face-up. However, this can be done only when the card is currently usable, so you cannot use this method if you're trying to trade neighborhood properties which are not yet in play. (You can still trade them, just face-down only.)&#10;&#10;This redevelopment phase helps to solve the stand-off issue in which players are tempted to hoard properties when the person owning the neighboring property was also doing the same thing. Now the city enforces a &quot;use it or lose it&quot; policy.&#10;&#10;&bull; Escalating City Hall Points - City Hall starts the game worth 0 points, but each round it escalates by 1 point up to a maximum of 5.&#10;&#10;&bull; Early Game End - If everyone passes or uses the exchange action, the game ends immediately. That means there is no guarantee your city will become a Big City. Be very sure not to leave the leader in control of the last downtown property before City Hall is built!&#10;&#10;&bull; Base Game 2-4 players only - The original edition allowed up to 5 players, but this was widely-considered to be too many players because such a large proportion of neighborhoods started the game on the board and the action became crowded in a hurry. As per Benno's request, the base game is now just 2-4.&#10;&#10;&bull; New Waterfront Tile - Basically it's a neighborhood where nothing can be built. It acts as both a barrier to adjoining neighborhood placement, but also it provides a bonus to residential placed nearby.&#10;&#10;",

Terrain cards show a number of tracks ranging from 0 to 3 and require from 6 to 10 tracks to cross depending on the type of terrain. In turn order, players flip additional terrain cards, and decide whether to build (cross terrain) or pass. When a terrain is crossed, the card is flipped face down and the player who completed the crossing receives back a number of pounds as indicated on the card. The track-building phase continues until one player has no terrain cards lying in front of their train, at which time a new set of terrain cards are auctioned.
