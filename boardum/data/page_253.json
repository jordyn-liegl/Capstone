Your objective is simple: successfully grow a 10 leaf tree before your opponents do. But actually doing this can get a bit tricky, with a huge variety of 165 different cards, ranging from some downright nasty attack cards, to more growth-focused and defensive cards (scroll down to see all of them). Every game has a fresh set of challenges, opportunities, and strategies. You might try and truncate your trainee's tree, or you might just end up Stumped.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Each player transforms into a frog and jumps after gold and silver coins, which are on the bottom of the pond. Whichever frog can out-jump and collect the most coins wins.   This game comes with no board.  Instead 12 small wooden plates are present, on which sea-roses are shown. These are now set up in such a way that each frog can jump easily from sea-rose to sea-rose.&#10;&#10;The length of the frog&rsquo;s jump is decided through cubes and then when one is finished jumping one picks from a material bag that also contains worthless black stones in addition to the gold and silver.&#10;&#10;In order to prevent the first frog from jumping all of the sea-roses the first frog placed may do only one jump, the second placed may do two, the third, three and the fourth four.  Play remains exciting during the entire operational sequence. If one lands on the same rose as another frog one shakes and calls themselves  &quot;good friends&quot;.  A successful high-quality children's game, which captivates with  beautiful, attractive  wood  characters&#10;&#10;Ages 5 and up.&#10;&#10;",

For each resource field on the spinner, three colors of settlements are shown. These colors will produce the resource in question for all players when the spinner lands there. Then a player may build new things by paying the appropriate amount and, either take a new piece of chocolate from the box and add it to their display, or for cities, turn over the settlement piece to its back side which have a city of the same color.

In each scenario, you choose tiles to combine to form the battlefield. Then, you use squads to achieve your objective. You might be fighting to control a zone, placing units in a certain location, or eliminating your opponent's units. There are three levels of play: Boot Camp, Intermediate, and Advanced. The Advanced mode includes rules for air support, destructible cover, special commander powers, and class-specific powers.&#10;&#10;On their turn, players will draw cards based on how many and which type of control points they own, move aircraft, fight other aircraft, move one squad, and fire with one squad. The game's cards allow players to recruit new units, call in airstrikes, or manipulate combat odds by upgrading the specialized attack and defense dice to more powerful ones with better results. The winning player or team is the one that accomplishes the stated victory condition on a scenario, usually by holding a specific set of territories or eliminating an entire opposing force.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Yahtzee Steal the Deal features a variation of the standard Yahtzee theme as instead of choosing what to roll for, each player has a card drawn from the library with a specific combination. The goal is to get the combination shown on the player's card within the number of rolls given to score points. If a player is unable to complete a card an opponent can try to steal it for half points by rolling the remaining dice and if successful will be able to attempt their own card in the same turn, but failing the steal will end the turn. When all cards are claimed, the person with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;The game comes with five dice, twelve cards, and a rule sheet that are all stored in a small plastic case for easy transportation and storage.&#10;&#10;",

You turn over a face-down card on a grid of cards, and replace it with a card from your hand. The catch is that each row and each column may never have more than one of each animal. Animals have different point values on their cards, and only one card will count positive points - more than one of a type will count negative points at the end. Hyenas, however are always negative.&#10;&#10;Originally Published in German as Alles f&uuml;r die Katz:&#10;The title means &quot;Everything for the Cat&quot; and may have an idiomatic meaning of &quot;all for nothing.&quot;&#10;&#10;In Alles f&uuml;r die Katz The animals in the zoo are loose and players must attempt to collect one of each type out of a face down grid which represents the zoo, but must avoid collecting any black cats which do not belong in the zoo. Adults should be sure to use the Advanced Rules to ensure an interesting game. Otherwise, the rules are the same as the English version (7 Safari).&#10;&#10;",

It was rumored that perhaps they were the original colonizers and space-farers of the first human age.&#10;&#10;Now, at the edge of a colossal black hole, a pyramid-craft known as the Zoneplex has emerged with legendary markings and glyphs of the deep past. The known empires have sent their elite warrior-monk mystics on a one-way mission to gain control of the Zoneplex, to emerge victorious and ultimately control the pathways of the universe and time itself.&#10;&#10;Zoneplex is a game that combines a tile-laying/exploration mechanism, a collaborative battle system and a zone control system to create an intriguing adventure in an alien pyramid.&#10;&#10;The game works in 2 phases with the first phase players not counting Influence points until the pyramid is completed.&#10;&#10;In phase 1 players strategically lay tiles determined by action cards to build their pathway through the Zoneplex pyramid whilst being cognizant of the Sacred Symbol card that they are bestowed with before the game begins. While building strategically players also confront creatures within the pyramid which they must collect to become worthy to enter the Eye and win the game. The players control the Zoneplex by gaining Influence points which occurs when a Player places a spirit-stone on the board. Spirit Stones not only sustain one's Influence points but can also be removed to gain bonuses in combat.&#10;&#10;In phase 2 after exploring the pyramid, the players reveal their Sacred Symbol cards and count influence points, then a cutthroat race for survival and worthiness begins as players vie to enter &quot;The Eye of The Zoneplex&quot; to become the decisive winner or stand their ground with the most influence points as the action cards run out.&#10;&#10;",

The contestant can use each help only once.&#10;&#10;If the contestant gives the correct response, the money is added to the bank equal to the level the player is on multiplied by the number of tokens the mob has put on the wrong responses.

    "description": "You&rsquo;ve been given a unique opportunity to become a head of the magnificent city of Urbis. There is always a plenty of those who are eager to take this place, so when such a chance comes up, they&rsquo;re ready to take it by all means.&#10;&#10;The city of Urbis is ruled by the City Council elected by the residents. The main objective of the game is to become the Head of the Council. Like all the other players, you are a Council member who is responsible for the well-being and prosperity of the city.  Each Council member (player) has an access to the city treasury and guard, and is obliged to follow the Council&rsquo;s decreets. Each councillor is in charge of one of the city blocks (represented by a board given to each player in the beginning of the game) and aspires to develop his block either quickly or proficiently. Gold and silver from the treasury are distributed depending on the buildings that have been put up on the block. However the block residents are always on the lookout: no one wants to live close to the cemetery, gibbet or prison. Take thought for the residents, spend some money, and these grim buildings will appear on the neighbour&rsquo;s block instead of your own. Hospital is also an essential city institution but it demands substantial charges to maintain. Taking this into account a player might awaken his inner dictator and build up his block with slums and honky-tonks, regardless of the residents&rsquo; needs, because the first player to fill all the building slots on his block becomes a winner.  Which way is the best? To consider the block residents or to just execute the will of the Council? To turn your block into a dark place or a blooming garden? In Urbis you&rsquo;ll have to make decisions promptly.&#10;&#10;",

The first squirrel to gather 15 pine cones in his hoard wins.  Spaces on the track give you one to three pine cones when you land on them, and the special die makes you lose your move now and then --instead, every squirrel gets a free pine cone.&#10;   The tricky part is that your wheelbarrow tips over and loses its contents whenever you exceed its capacity: six pine cones.  Every other squirrel laps the track in the opposite direction to yours, so there are plenty of squirrel encounters.  Every time you leap over another squirrel (going one way or the other), you can steal from or give to him up to three of your cones.  Therein lies all the strategy.&#10;&#10;",

Forseti has more powerful units; his armies are the greatest in the world, and they fight much better than Lord Gorganun's. However, Lord Gorganun has a magical edge. He controls more powerful wizards than does Lord Forseti, and he can gain allies in the magical fairy people known as the Cadmin and the mighty dragon, Terromax.

    "description": "Inverted Dice is a challenging tactic dice game for smart adults and curious children. The game introduces a new way to look at dice rolls &ndash; a way to regard five normal six-sided dice as one big twenty-sided die (with some odd probability properties). Normally, you would throw some dice and use the sum of the numbers being shown. In this game, you use the sum of the numbers not being shown:&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#10;Such a sum is called an inverted dice sum. &#10; You need five dice to play. The structure of the game is a bit like the one in Yahtzee, with a similar score chart and three rolls (or fewer) per turn.&#10; There are twenty rounds in the game. In each round, players take turns rolling five dice, trying to reach one of the inverted sums 1 to 20 (it has to be a number that the player has not previously achieved or zeroed out).&#10; After each inverted dice roll, the player chooses which dice to keep, and which to reroll. A player may reroll some or all of the dice up to two times on a turn, making a maximum of three rolls each turn.&#10; If a player achieves an available result, it is registered in the score chart.&#10; If the player fails (after three rolls), a number must be recorded as zero points.&#10; Every player must put either a score or a zero into a score box each turn.&#10; The game ends when all score boxes are used. The player with the highest total score wins the game.&#10;&#10;Players can receive maximum three bonuses by achieving all scores in one or more bonus sections.&#10;&#10;",

The first player plays any card, then calls &quot;Higher&quot; or &quot;Lower&quot;; the next player must play an appropriate card or pass, laying down her cards and stepping out of the round. Instead of playing higher or lower, however, a player can play a card of the same value, saying &quot;Double up&quot;, which forces all subsequent players to also play a card of the same value.&#10;&#10;Two escape valves exist in the game: A player can always play a 7 &mdash; the large joker &mdash; no matter what was played previously, with this player calling out &quot;Higher&quot; or &quot;Lower&quot; as normal. A player can play a 1 &mdash; the small joker &mdash; no matter whether &quot;Higher&quot; or &quot;Lower&quot; was called, but a 1 can't be played on doubled cards; the 1 can itself be doubled, with only a 7 being able to break the doubling.&#10;&#10;As soon as all but one player have passed for the round, the round ends and the lone player still in the round receives one point for each played card. A round might also end by players running out of cards in hand, but the final card played in a round that ends this way cannot be a joker (unless a joker was also the next-to-last card). Once a round ends, players have the option to ditch their hand, after which everyone refills their hand to seven cards and a new round begins.&#10;&#10;The first player to have at least sixty points wins!&#10;&#10;",

On a turn, a player can roll the dice up to three times, setting aside any dice that she wants to keep after each of the first two rolls. If a player could claim a target card after the first or second roll &ndash; such as a card showing three-of-a-kind &ndash; but decides to roll again, she can no longer claim that card after a future roll. Once a player claims a card, her turn ends and the next player goes, rolling all six dice to start the turn.&#10;&#10;If a player doesn't claim a card, however, the next player has the option of immediately claiming a card that matches the dice previously set aside or keeping those dice set aside and having only two rolls on his turn to try to claim a card.&#10;&#10;Some cards have icons that allow whoever wins it to take a special action, such as a bonus turn or theft of a card from an opponent.&#10;&#10;After a player has claimed a certain number of cards (4, 5 or 7 with four-to-six, three or two players), that player can decide to end the game.

The goal is to visit as many destinations as possible in six differently colored regions. Whenever a player reaches a destination, he lays the corresponding city card in front of himself. The game ends when a player has at least ten city cards (or nine cards with five or six players) in six different colors before himself, although the round is played to its end. The winner is the player who visited the most destinations in all six colored regions.&#10;&#10;New game mechanisms: Europareise possesses novel game mechanisms that differ from the familiar travel games in the Ravensburger catalog (Deutschlandreise, Weltreise). Movement doesn't come from dice, but rather from tickets for planes, ships, trains, and cars.

When a player guesses the answer of a space with a star, he receives a token of the color associated with the topic answered correctly. The first to get a token from each category wins!&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Walk the Plank is a fast-moving card game for three to nine players, ages eight and up. The object is to win the most battles in any given round to become Captain for the next round. But be careful &ndash; if you don&rsquo;t win ANY battles in a round, you&rsquo;re out of the game. You&rsquo;re dealt fewer cards in each successive round, and the player who wins the final round wins the game! Play is fast and furious, with an average game time of only 10 minutes.&#10;&#10;Walk the Plank comes with a deck of 68 cards. The deck has sixty-five numbered cards, two Walk the Plank! cards, and one Sea Monster! card. The sixty-five numbered cards are divided into five suits: Doubloons, Hookhands, Monkeys, Parrots, and Peglegs. The cards in each suit are numbered 1 through 13, with 1 worth the least and 13 worth the most.&#10;&#10;The first dealer, or Captain, deals 7 cards to each player in the first round of seven. Subsequent rounds deal one less card. (Round 2 is 6 cards, Round 3 is 5 cards, etc.) The Captain then turns over the top card on the deck so that everyone may see it. The suit of the card revealed will be trump for the first round. The trump suit is the most powerful suit in any given battle. For example, if Monkeys are trump, then a low card in Monkeys will beat even a higher-numbered card in any other suit. If the card the Captain turns over is a Walk the Plank! or a Sea Monster!, there is no trump suit for this first round. In every round after the first, whoever is Captain chooses the trump suit after looking at his or her cards.&#10;&#10;The suit of the first card played in a battle is called the current suit. If this card is a numbered card, it may or may not be from the trump suit. If the first card played in a battle is one of the three special cards, there is no current suit for that battle, but each player still has to play one card.&#10;&#10;You must play a card of the same suit as the first card played in each battle, if you can. We call this following suit. So if you have any cards in your hand of the same suit as the first one played in a battle, you have to pick one and play it. You don&rsquo;t have to follow suit if you have no cards in the current suit. You don&rsquo;t have to follow suit if you have a special card (Walk the Plank! or Sea Monster!), unless you choose not to play the special card.&#10;&#10;Walk the Plank! will win any battle, beating even the highest card in the trump suit&mdash;think of it as a &ldquo;wild card&rdquo; worth one more than the highest card in play. When someone plays Sea Monster!, no one wins the battle, no matter what cards&#10;have been played. The player who played Sea Monster! doesn't win the battle, but he/she does gain control. (So he/she gets to choose the current suit for the next battle by playing the first card.)&#10;&#10;The player who wins the battle in the round becomes the Captain in the next round, which means you get to play the first card in the next battle.&#10;&#10;If you win one or more battles in a round in which no other player wins a battle, you win the game!&#10;&#10;",

The puzzles range from single to four card ones, and from light to quite heavy.&#10;Players can use hints to help with the solving, but it costs them Reputation cards. Giving a wrong answer also makes the players lose a Reputation card.&#10;The more Reputation Cards the players have left at the end, the easier it is for them to follow the &quot;Hunch&quot; found on the remaining cards, and ultimately choosing the correct option in the &quot;Final Choice&quot;&#10;The high age recommendation comes from a few graphic details in the story.
