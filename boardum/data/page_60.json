    "description": "[from the back of the flatpack edition]&#10;&#10;Wellington's Victory : The Battle of Waterloo&#10;&#10;- Four-color 68&rdquo; x 44&rdquo; contour map in four sections&#10;- Innovative Fire and Shock Combat mechanics&#10;- Line, Column, Square, Skirmish and Cavalry formations&#10;- Hougomont, La Haye Sainte and Plancenoit Scenarios&#10;- 40 Game-Turn Grand Battle Scenario&#10;&#10;Wellington's Victory is a grand tactical simulation of the Battle of Waterloo which occurred on June 18, 1815, at a minor crossroads south of Brussels, Belgium.  The battle marked the first and only encounter of history's two most renowned generals, Sir Arthur Wellesley, Duke of Wellington, and Napoleon Bonaparte, Emperor of France.  A brutal day-long French assault against the British held ridge brought Wellington's army to the brink of defeat.  By later afternoon, however, the arrival of Wellington's allies tipped the odds decisively against the French; Napoleon chose to stake his empire on the outcome of a final attack by his most trusted troops &ndash; the Imperial Guard.  Wellington's Victory is played on an innovative game map composed of four 34&rdquo; x 22&rdquo; map sections on which significant differences in ground contours are differentiated by color.  There are five distinct contour levels depicted on the map as well as an extremely accurate survey of all battle field terrain features including Hougomont, La Haye Sainte, and almost every other farm and dwelling, woods and orchards, streams and ponds, and raised and sunken roads.&#10;&#10;Each of more than 500 French, Prussian and Anglo-Dutch combat and command units are fully identified by battalion, regiment, brigade, division and corps designations as well as numerical game values which differentiate each unit's strength, effectiveness, and mobility.&#10;&#10;The game utilizes a fifteen minute Game-Turn.  Each mapsheet hex represents a distance of 100 yards.  Each Strength Point represents 100 infantry or cavalry troops or one gun or howitzer within an artillery battery.  Each Game-Turn employs a unique, asymmetrical, sequence of play in which Players alternately participate in a series of Phases covering activities which include the execution of chain of command mechanics (such as activating and committing reserve formations and initiating cavalry charges), rallying disordered and routed units, executing facing and formation changes (including a repertoire of infantry formations such as column, line, square and open order or skirmish formation), regular and grand tactical movement, and finally executing artillery and small arms fire as well as infantry and cavalry shock command.&#10;&#10;The Fire and Shock Combat mechanics which decide the battle were also designed to yield realistic results without sacrificing playability.  Fire resolution requires no arithmetic calculation since each unit fires separately.  The Relative Firepower Table used to resolve Fire Combat is a new type of CRT which directly interrelates the strength, formation and quality of the firing unit with the formation and terrain cover employed by the defending unit.  The Shock Combat Table is also unique in that it employs an &ldquo;odds&rdquo; comparison to account for Troop strength differences between the attacker and defender and a &ldquo;differential&rdquo; comparison to account for any qualitative difference between the opposing forces.  Losses, which are recorded directly on the map by placing a Strength marker under the unit suffering casualties, may result from either Fire or Shock combat.  In general, however, Shock Combat is depicted as a &ldquo;morale showdown&rdquo; more useful for gaining ground than inflicting casualties.&#10;&#10;Morale, which Napoleon deemed to be three times as important as numerical strength on the battlefield, is accurately accounted for in the Effectiveness Rating assigned to every infantry battalion, cavalry regiment and artillery battery crew.&#10;&#10;Buyer's Guide for WELLINGTON'S VICTORY&#10;The following ratings are based on at least 100 player-replies to surveys conducted through Strategy &amp; Tactics Magazine.  Ratings are on a 1 (worst) to 9 (best) scale.  Average ratings (for over 60 historical games in print) are:  Acceptability-6.00, Complexity-5.00.&#10;&#10;Acceptability Rating:        New Game&#10;Complexity Rating:        (est.) 7.8&#10;Avg. Playing Time [hrs.]    (est.) 6.0&#10;&#10;&ldquo;Acceptability&rdquo; depends a lot on which historical period interests you the most.  &ldquo;Complexity&rdquo; ratings for other games are, for example, Monopoly &ndash; 2.34;  Afrika Korps &ndash; 3.48; Diplomacy &ndash; 4.51; France, 1940 &ndash; 5.78; PanzerBlitz &ndash; 7.01.

    "description": "Over the course of four rounds in Dungeon Draft, 2-5 players draft heroes and weapons &mdash; using gold to pay for them &mdash; then use them to defeat monsters, acquire additional gold, and complete quests in an effort to earn the most experience points (XP).&#10;&#10;Set-up:&#10;At the beginning of the game each player is dealt 5 Quest cards. Then, each player selects 3 of their Quests to keep and returns the remainder facedown to the bottom of the Quest Deck. Each round players draft a 7 card hand. Cards are passed either clockwise or counter clockwise depending on the round. Players then take turns playing as many cards as they can from their hand, provided they have the resources to do so.&#10;&#10;Randomly determine which player will play first during the Play Phase. The starting player will alternate in a clockwise fashion during each of the four rounds.&#10;&#10;Playing Cards:&#10;To play Heroes and Weapons, players must spend Gold equal to the Gold Cost in the upper left corner of the card. Spent Gold is returned to the common pool of available Gold.&#10;&#10;Heroes and Weapons remain in front of you when played. Some Heroes and Weapons have special text abilities that take effect when played.&#10;&#10;All Heroes and Weapons will only have effects that last for the remainder of the round, with the exception of providing Attack, Gold, and XP (i.e. ignore everything but the numbers and symbols on the left side of the card during future rounds).&#10;&#10;Class Icons:&#10;Each Hero and Weapon has a class. Classes are indicated by card color and icon. Class is very important! Many powers on Heroes and Weapons can only be used if you control enough cards of the appropriate class.&#10;&#10;Monsters&#10;To defeat Monsters, players must have Attack equal to or greater than the Monster Attack Cost in the upper left corner of the card. Attack is not &ldquo;spent&rdquo; like Gold, so a player can defeat any number of Monsters whose Attack Cost is lower than or equal to the combined Attack of all cards you control.&#10;&#10;Some Monsters have a text box with special effects on the card. After you defeat one of these Monsters, follow the instructions and then put the Monster into the Draft Deck Discard Pile.&#10;&#10;Some Monsters have XP or Gold values on the card. After you defeat one of these Monsters, take the corresponding XP and/or Gold from the corresponding pool and then put the Monster into the Draft Deck Discard Pile.&#10;&#10;Quests&#10;To play Quests, players must have Heroes and Weapons of the appropriate class. Quests have no cost other than this requirement. Unlike Heroes and Weapons, Quest Cards may have abilities that can be used over multiple rounds.&#10;&#10;End of Turn&#10;Once a player has finished playing any cards they wish to play (and has the resources to play), they must:&#10;&bull; Discard all unplayed Draft Cards to the Draft Deck Discard Pile (do not discard Quest Cards OR played Heroes and Weapons).&#10;&bull; Gain 5 Gold plus additional Gold equal to the total Gold Production on all cards in front of you.&#10;&bull; Play passes to the next player.&#10;&#10;End of Round&#10;Once all players have completed the Play Phase, the next round will begin. In each round, the starting player will rotate clockwise (i.e. the player who played second in the previous round will start the next round). TIP: At the end of each round, it is helpful to stack all of your played Heroes and Weapons so that only their icons are visible. This clears room for the next round&rsquo;s cards and helps to avoid confusion since only the icon powers remain in effect for future rounds.&#10;&#10;After four rounds have been completed, players tally up XP to determine the winner. The player with the most XP at the end of the game is the winner! Huzzah!&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "It Never Snows is a Standard Combat Series (SCS) game covering the pivotal Market Garden offensive in September, 1944. Using a system based on the well-received SCS Game Bastogne, It Never Snows covers the landings and ground offensive endeavoring to link up with them at 600m per hex with units generally companies. Each turn is half a day making for a 17 turn campaign game (uniquely playable among Market Garden games).&#10;  &#10;The expansive five map area allows each of the airborne division fights to be geographically isolated and separate, as was the case historically. What this does is that it allows each situation to be gamed as its own little tactical puzzle&mdash;making it such that a player might be &ldquo;winning&rdquo; in one region while &ldquo;losing&rdquo; in another, at the same time. Both players are always &ldquo;in the game.&rdquo;&#10;  &#10;While the Allied player is busy dropping paratroopers, establishing bridgeheads and running a ground offensive to link up with them, the German player must devastate the airborne forces clinging to Arnhem, defend the various river crossings and counterattack to sever the Allied supply lines. Both players are attacking and defending at the same time, every turn.&#10;  &#10;Following on the heels of Bastogne, It Never Snows uses a tactical model with a minimal amount of rules overhead which shows both set-piece as well as &ldquo;on the fly&rdquo; attacks and the effects of indirect fires and air support.&#10;  &#10;A fantastically detailed OOB shows the insane array of German units being scratched together to defeat the Allied offensive&mdash;from displaced sailors to the deaf, from elite armor to barely trained school units, from highly motivated SS to penal units being pushed into battle at gunpoint. Against the elite airborne troops of the Allies, this menagerie is hardly the German army many wargamers envision when they think of World War II.&#10;&#10;Scenarios:&#10;&#10;     Campaign.

Play it during business meetings, datenight your uncle's funeral - or all three at once!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the box&#10;&#10;Gameplay: &#10;One player reads a question (all answers are numbers). The active player must guess a number that is close to - but not higher - than the correct answer. Players take turns either making a guess that is higher than the previous player, or calling out a DARE if they believe the previous player guessed too high. When a Dare is called the answer is checked and the player who was wrong must keep the card for &quot;Silly goose points&quot;. Once a player has collected a certain number of cards, the game ends, and the player with the most silly goose points loses. Everyone else wins. &#10; Nearly no table space is required, and the game therefore works well as a party game in nearly any setting.&#10;&#10;&quot;How Dare you?&quot; comes with 2 optional advanced rules that spice up the gameplay:&#10;&#10;&quot;Doubling&quot;: If you guess a number that is at least twice that of the previous player, you gain a doubling card. This card negates one &quot;silly goose point&quot;.

    "description": "In the two-player card game Crazy Chicken, players try to collect as many types of chickens as possible. Each turn, they draw two cards &ndash; from the two draw piles or two discard piles, with each card coming from a different pile &ndash; then either discard one card or lay down a set of cards. To lay down a set, you need at least two cards if that type of chicken hasn't been played or more cards than are already on the table if it has been played. Any cards of the same type on the table are discarded onto a single discard pile. The round ends when one player has six types of chicken, all types of chicken are on the table, or only one draw pile remains. Players then earn points based on which types of chickens they own: for example, Marilyn Henroe has only six cards in the deck and is worth 6 points, while Billy the Chick has twenty cards and is worth 20 points.&#10;&#10;After four rounds, the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;In 2005, SimplyFun republished Crazy Chicken as Drive, with rules for up to four players and a collectible car theme. Three rounds are played rather than four.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "(in English, from the designer:)&#10;&#10;Waterloo 1815, Fallen eagles is a regiment/battalion level game of the famous battle.&#10;&#10;The game includes 400 counters (French, Anglo-allied and Prussian order of battle for June 18th 1815), a 108 x 75 cm map (200 meters per hexagon; 42.5 x 29.5 inches, in 2 parts), various play aids, a rule book and a playbook. It is a one hour of real time per turn game that can be completed in 5 to 10 hours of play. Beside the full battle game, several scenarios are available (Hougoumont, D'Erlon attack, Plancenoit). In addition, what if options will allow players to simulate alternate history variations to the battle.&#10;&#10;Fallen Eagles provides a detailed view of the battle but in a playable way. The focus is on morale, attrition and commitment of formation (division &amp; corps) at the right time, rather than tactical chrome. The detailed order of battle and the scale of the game allow players to really see the action and the game system provides a quick but realistic resolution.&#10;&#10;A new system has been created and combat result tables have been tested against actual historical results of this battle. This system is a mix of well-known concepts and new features to maximize playability and realism of outcomes.&#10;&#10;Formation are given simple orders than limit their ability to freely react to any sudden change of priority. Orders take some time a while before being changed. Units are classically rated for size, quality and movement. Formations activate one after the other at player's choice but have to follow the order they received at the beginning of the turn or even before. Game features offensive fire, defensive fire, opportunity fire, charge and counter charge, retreat before combat and melee. A lot of classical &quot;prohibitions&quot; are transformed into options: for example, cavalry can move from ZOC to ZOC but risk counter charges or more opportunity fire. A ZOC of a strong unit is therefore not the same as the ZOC of a weaker one.&#10;&#10;The game turn has a random ending procedure and players are never sure to have time to move all their formation reflecting the command control issues of any battle. Also, the fatigue and friction factors are built in a potentially shorter turn length in the latter stages of the battle. Focus on morale and attrition is a testimony of a battle which was a test of will of two densely packed armies fighting head to head. Players will have to choose which unit will &quot;lead&quot; the attack and take the first fire. Failing a key morale test can make the difference between a stalled attack or a promising breakthrough.&#10;&#10;Game variations will include, for example, the Prussian arrival sooner or later than history, or a better weather the day before allowing for an earlier start of the french attack.&#10;&#10;Victory is determined with &quot;sudden death&quot; objectives given to both sides in order to simulate historical constraints but also by control of key objectives and losses at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;According to Wellington, Waterloo was a &quot;near run thing&quot;. Will the thin red line hold against the French furia again?&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;================================================================(traduction fran&ccedil;aise du texte anglais:)&#10;&#10;Waterloo 1815, la chute des Aigles est un jeu de niveau r&eacute;giment / bataillon de la c&eacute;l&egrave;bre bataille.&#10;&#10;Le jeu comprend un peu plus de 400 pions (ordre de bataille fran&ccedil;ais, anglo-alli&eacute; et prussien du 18 Juin 1815), une carte 108 par 75 cm (200 m&egrave;tres par hexagone), diverses aides de jeu, un livret de r&egrave;gle et un livret de jeu. L'&eacute;chelle est d'une heure par tour et le jeu peut &ecirc;tre termin&eacute; en 5 &agrave; 10 heures. En plus de la bataille compl&egrave;te, plusieurs sc&eacute;narios sont disponibles (Hougoumont, d'Erlon attaque, Plancenoit). Des options permettront aux joueurs d'explorer des alternatives.&#10;&#10;La chute des Aigles propose une vue d&eacute;taill&eacute;e mais jouable de la bataille. L'accent est mis sur le moral, l'attrition et l'engagement des formations (division et corps) au moment opportun, plut&ocirc;t que sur le chrome tactique. L'ordre de bataille d&eacute;taill&eacute; et l'&eacute;chelle du jeu permettent aux joueurs d'entrer dans l'action. Le syst&egrave;me offre une r&eacute;solution rapide mais r&eacute;aliste des combats.&#10;&#10;Un nouveau syst&egrave;me a &eacute;t&eacute; cr&eacute;&eacute; et les tables de combat ont &eacute;t&eacute; test&eacute;s par rapport aux r&eacute;sultats historiques. Ce syst&egrave;me est un m&eacute;lange de concepts bien connus et de nouvelles fonctionnalit&eacute;s pour optimiser jouabilit&eacute; et r&eacute;alisme.&#10;&#10;Des ordres simples sont donn&eacute;s aux formations, limitant leur capacit&eacute; &agrave; r&eacute;agir &agrave; un changement soudain de priorit&eacute;. Les ordres peuvent se poursuivent avant d'&ecirc;tre chang&eacute;s. Les unit&eacute;s sont &eacute;valu&eacute;es de fa&ccedil;on habituelle par la taille, la qualit&eacute; et le mouvement. Les formations sont activ&eacute;es les unes apr&egrave;s les autres, au choix du joueur, mais doivent suivre l'ordre qu'elles ont re&ccedil;u au d&eacute;but du tour, voire avant. Le jeu inclut le feu offensif et d&eacute;fensif, les tirs d'opportunit&eacute;, la charge et la contre-charge, la retraite avant combat et la m&ecirc;l&eacute;e. Un grand nombre d'&quot;interdictions&quot; classiques sont transform&eacute;es en options : par exemple, la cavalerie peut se d&eacute;placer de ZDC (zone de contr&ocirc;le) &agrave; ZDC, mais est menac&eacute;e par la contre-charge ou le feu d'opportunit&eacute;. Une ZDC d'une unit&eacute; puissante n'est donc pas la m&ecirc;me que la ZDC d'une unit&eacute; plus faible.&#10;&#10;Le tour de jeu comprend une fin de tour al&eacute;atoire. Les joueurs ne sont jamais certains de disposer de toutes leurs formations, refl&eacute;tant les probl&egrave;mes de commandement durant toute bataille. En outre, la fatigue et la &quot;friction&quot; se traduisent dans des tours de jeu potentiellement plus courts &agrave; la fin. L'accent mis sur &#226;&#128;&#139;&#226;&#128;&#139;le moral et l'usure, est un reflet de cette bataille qui fut une &eacute;preuve de d&eacute;termination pour ces deux arm&eacute;es, denses et combattant pied &agrave; pied. Les joueurs devront choisir l'unit&eacute; en t&ecirc;te qui conduira l'attaque et subira le premier feu. L'&eacute;chec d'un test de moral peut faire la diff&eacute;rence entre une attaque avort&eacute;e ou une perc&eacute;e prometteuse.&#10;&#10;Les variantes pr&eacute;voient, par exemple, l'arriv&eacute;e pr&eacute;coce ou tardive des Prussiens, ou une meilleure m&eacute;t&eacute;o la veille, permettant une attaque fran&ccedil;aise plus t&ocirc;t.&#10;&#10;La victoire est d&eacute;termin&eacute;e &agrave; la fois par des objectifs de &quot;mort subite&quot; donn&eacute;s aux deux camps afin de simuler les contraintes historiques pendant l'action, mais aussi par le contr&ocirc;le d'objectifs et les pertes inflig&eacute;es en fin de partie.&#10;&#10;Selon Wellington, Waterloo fut une &laquo;affaire tr&eacute;s serr&eacute;e&raquo;. La mince ligne rouge tiendra t-elle &agrave; nouveau contre la &laquo;furia fran&ccedil;aise&raquo; ?&#10;&#10;",

Just as Zombie Fluxx draws on all those classic Zombie movies for inspiration, Martian Fluxx is about all those great alien invasion stories going back to the original, the War of the Worlds.&#10;&#10;Some of the Keepers you'll find in the Martian Fluxx: Mars, the Mothership, the Flying Saucer, the Tripod, the City, the Cow, the Ray Gun, the Space Suit, and the Tentacle.&#10;&#10;The Tentacle? I hear you asking. How is that a good thing? All those other things sound like great Keepers but what's good about a tentacle? Well, they're great if you're a Martian... which is what we are in this game!&#10;&#10;In Martian Fluxx, the players are invaders from Mars, and the Creepers are those pesky Pathetic Humans who are always getting in our way, keeping us from winning. Cows of course are Keepers because for Humans and Martians alike, they're good eating. There are actually two Cow Keepers in the game; if you have them both you can win with the Goal &quot;Two All-Beef Earthlings.&quot;&#10;&#10;The idea of making us the Martians came about as I realized the Martians are the ones who get all the cool stuff! Other cool Keepers you'll find include the Abduction Chamber (which you can hide your Pathetic Humans in), the Space Modulator and the Mind-Control Transmitter. And yes, you can use that Ray Gun to vaporize Pathetic Humans. (The Germs Creeper however is harder to get rid of...)&#10;&#10;So that's a sneak peek at Martian Fluxx.&#10;&#10;Part of the Fluxx series.&#10;&#10;",

(Value and rank are the same as in Skat and Schafkopf.) Each round players are dealt five cards, replenishing from stock after each trick, with one turned up to indicate trump. The goal in each deal is to accumulate sixty-six trick points, where the card values are A=11, T=10, K=4, Q=3, J=2.  The suit led does not need to be followed until the stock is closed or exhausted, at which point suit must be followed, the trick must be won if possible, and you must trump if you cannot follow suit.&#10;&#10;Sixty-Six is a variant including nines and therefore 24 cards in total. Instead of five, six cards are dealt each round.&#10;&#10;Depending on the margin by which a player wins the deal, that player scores 1-3 game points.  A player who reaches 7 points wins the whole game. If the other player failed to gain any points in the meantime, the game is a Bummerl of double value. This only matters if playing a match of multiple games, which ends once a player reaches a previously agreed upon number of points. Detailed rules can be found at http://psellos.com/schnapsen/rules.html.&#10;&#10;There also exists a - more complex - variant for three to four players: Bauernschnapsen.&#10;Commercial variants include WOO, Route 66: Get Your Tricks and Alpine Tricks&#10;&#10;",

Whenever you land on an island, you reach $25 from the bank, but you must then pay $5 to each player who landed there ahead of you. At the end of a round, players collect the wages next to the captain and first mate spots holding their dice.&#10;&#10;A player who has visited four islands can return to Tonga Bonga Bay, collecting $10 when they dock there.

    "description": "Circus Train Second Edition, by designer Tom Decker, is a 1-5 player game in which you are the owner and operator of a small circus train in prohibition-era America. In this game, you and your opponents are vying to employ the best talent while putting on the most magnificent show each month. While touring the country by train, you will have the opportunity to perform while adding talent to your show through hiring the performers stranded in cities by defunct circuses. Just remember to keep an eye on your wages, because your talent definitely will.&#10;&#10;Through clever card hand management, you control the movement of your train around the American northeast, making strategic business decisions about talent, performances and payroll in this fast-paced strategy game. Each turn represents one week of real time, and after six months, the circus season closes for the year and the game ends with one player declared as having The Greatest Show on Earth.&#10;&#10;Inspired by Sara Gruen&rsquo;s novel, Water for Elephants, Circus Train Second Edition includes thematic elements such as improving your show&rsquo;s reputation by picking up alcohol for your talent and staff (legally, in Canada), the high costs of supplying big cats and elephants, and the ability to &ldquo;red light&rdquo; (firing by throwing off the train) disgruntled talent or talent that has simply become too expensive to maintain. These elements are blended into the game&rsquo;s mechanics, keeping it all simple while adding layers of depth and strategy.&#10;&#10;What's New in 2nd Edition:&#10;&#10;This new edition combines the first edition with its first expansion. Along with a graphic face-lift, it adds more players (3 more), thereby changing the experience for a gamer and how they play Circus Train 2nd Edition. It also adds new, never-before-seen Event cards into the mix.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Clash of Giants II: The Campaigns of Galicia and First Ypres, 1914 is the sequel to Ted Raicer's acclaimed Clash of Giants: Campaigns of Tannenberg and the Marne, 1914. As with the original design, CoG II contains two separate games (both using the same basic system) covering two of the most interesting (and least-gamed) campaigns of the First World War, Galicia and First Ypres .&#10;&#10; Galicia 1914  pitted the armies of Tsarist Russia and Habsburg Austria-Hungary in a ferocious struggle along a 200 mile front. The Austrian commander, General Conrad, refused to wait for the arrival of his 2nd Army, which had been initially deployed to the Serbian front, before going onto the offensive. The Austrian attack began on 19 August, with Conrad's 1st and 4th Armies on the Austrian left flank striking the Russian 4th and 5th Armies on the Tsarist right. The Austrians outnumbered the Russians on this flank, and initially drove them back, and Conrad began to dream of pocketing the entire Russian army group. But the absence of the Austrian 2nd Army gave the Russians an even greater numerical advantage on the opposite flank, as two Russian armies (the 3rd and 8th) struck the Austrian 3rd east of Lemberg (Lvov). Soon it was Conrad's armies that were in danger of being cut off and destroyed. The campaign was a catastrophe for Austria-Hungary, but in the end the result was a fatally incomplete victory for the Russians.&#10;&#10;The  First Ypres  game is the first game to cover the climax of the &quot;Race to the Sea&quot; on the Western Front that followed the inconclusive Allied victory at the Marne. By 8 October the continued outflanking attempts by both sides had nearly reached the English Channel. A massive meeting engagement developed, with the Germans first attempting to launch a massive cavalry raid around the Allied northern flank in the direction of Abbeville. When this fizzled (due to the timely arrival of a French infantry corps), the French and British began their own offensive aimed at driving all the way to the German border. But the Allied attack quickly ran into German troops of the 6th Army, hurried north from Alsace-Lorraine. Falkenhayn, the German commander, now planned to play his trump card, striking the BEF with four newly-raised reserve corps of hurriedly-trained but enthusiastic volunteers. In a month of brutal struggle in which the British lost 60,000 men, the Germans lost well over 100,000. Not realizing that the BEF had been bled white and was on the point of breaking, Falkenhayn called off his attacks in mid-November. The attempts to end the war by Christmas were over.&#10;&#10;Clash of Giants II uses a slightly modified version of the original system to model these dynamic and closely balanced contests. As in Clash of Giants, the game emphasizes the difficulty of commanding groups of armies, with a system where movement allowance for each army is separately determined by a command roll. But CoGII adds an interactive random chit-pull activation sequence, so that neither player knows which of his commands will move next. Each player has only one combat phase per turn, which he may declare at the end of any one of his command activations, but which covers the entire map. This leads to many difficult game decisions: &quot;Do I declare combat now, with only part of my forces in position to attack, or wait hoping to get more units into the line, but risking the enemy either pulling back or striking first?&quot;&#10;&#10;Once combat is declared, CoGII uses the unique combat system so popular in Tannenberg and Marne, in which a unit's training, equipment, and morale are factored into a Tactical Effiency Rating that often counts more than mere numbers.&#10;&#10;Galicia 1914 includes a corps/division OB and a map scaled at 9 miles to the hex that covers the entire front from Krakow to the Romanian border. The victory conditions force the Austrian player to attack initially in order to gain enough VPs to survive the strong Russian offensive certain to follow. Galicia features special rules for the great Austrian fortress of Przemysl, Russian cavalry replacements, rail supply, Offensive Support Markers (representing heavy artillery and the logistical and command preparations of a major assault), and the arrival of the Austrian 2nd Army.&#10;The OB for First Ypres is at division level (with the odd brigade). The map scale is 3.3 miles to the hex, from Lens in the south to the English Channel. Special rules include Offensive Support Markers, the Belgian retreat onto the map from Antwerp, flooding the Yser River line, French and German cavalry replacements, unknown Tactical Efficiency Ratings for the German New Reserve Corps, and British tenacity (represented by remnant counters). Victory goes to the player who controls 5 of the 9 victory hexes at the end of the game, and the game is sometimes decided on the final combat roll by a last-ditch attack or defense of a single key hex.&#10;&#10;Components&#10;&#10;    One 22&quot; x 34&quot; backprinted game map&#10;    Two 8.5 x 11 Player Aid Cards&#10;    Two 5/8&quot; Countersheets&#10;    Two Six-sided Dice&#10;&#10;&#10;(from GMT Games website)&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Mars Attacks: The Miniatures Game is a tabletop miniature wargame based on the humorous 1962 Mars Attacks trading card series from Topps in which aliens from Mars try to take over the planet of the humans &mdash; that is, Earth!&#10;&#10;The game allows two (or more) players to take on the role of Martian invaders or the human resistance, then battle for the fate of the planet! You set your armies on the table board and move units of aliens or human soldiers to fight to achieve goals, either by defending your position or vaporizing your opponents. This tactical tabletop game features rules by veteran designer Jake Thornton and a host of stunning Mantic miniatures that can be used straight out of the box or painted to add even more character to your games.&#10;&#10;- Martian Mayhem: Mars Attacks is full of wacky events and cinematic action made possible by the simple set of game mechanics that are very easy to learn, and by the game's Event Card deck.&#10;&#10;- Story Driven Action: Follow our heroes during the battle of Greenville with fun playable scenarios, each with their own objectives: eliminate the enemy, capture the intelligence - escape the Martian invaders!&#10;&#10;- Easy to play: Much like a board game, Mars Attacks is played on a gaming mat made of squares and players take it in turn to activate their models, choosing whether to move, shoot or fight in hand-to-hand combat.&#10;&#10;- Simple Dice Mechanics: Shooting and hand-to-hand combat is made easy by rolling eight-sided dice to decide whether a weapon has hit its target, or whether the opponent manages to dodge out of the way.&#10;&#10;- Highly Tactical: move a figure out from behind cover and you&rsquo;re likely to get your model killed. Similarly, ganging up on an opponent or making use of a figure&rsquo;s special abilities could be the difference between making a clean kill, or engaging in a frantic game of cat and mouse!&#10;&#10;All of this is detailed in the comic-book sized Mars Attacks &ndash; The Miniatures Game rulebook which also includes a number of playable missions. These battles are fought in Greenville, a town brought to life through our stunning modular ruined scenery. You will fight amongst the devastated town capturing objectives such as intelligence and weapons - or with the sole goal of eliminating your enemy.&#10;&#10;Whether you&rsquo;re a veteran gamer or new to the hobby, you&rsquo;ll be able to enjoy the fun of Mars Attacks, making it a game suitable for all ages.&#10;&#10;",

Shoot to kill or claw your way through flesh as it doesn't matter how many should die in this urban landscape so long as players achieve their objectives.&#10;&#10;All of this is set against a sci-fi backdrop brought to life using a grid-based gaming mat depicting the urban warzone that can be built up using Barricades and Buildings from the new modular Mantic Scenery Range, adding a vertical dimension to your games.

If you start your turn on a Hex tile that grants you a specific Resource, add the corresponding Resource token to your Resource Pool.&#10;&#10;Phase 2&#10;During this phase, you get 4 Action points to spend, and you can use them to perform any of the Actions below in any order. Each Action costs 1 Action point. You can perform the same Action more than once on your turn if you still have Action points tospend. You do not have to spend all 4 Action points each turn, but unused Action points do not roll over to subsequent turns.&#10;&#10;Your Actions include:&#10;&#10;    TRAVEL: Move your Character from your current Hex tile (the Hex tile where your Meeple currently stands) to any adjacent Hex tile.&#10;    COLLECT: Move a Spell, Counterspell, or Resource card from next to your current Hex tile to your Spell Book by spending the required Resources shown in the card&rsquo;s Collection Cost. After you Collect a Spell or Resource card, immediately replace it with the top card from the Main deck. If you Collect a Counterspell card from the Counterspell deck, you do not need to replace it with a card from the Main deck.&#10;    REFRESH: Move the card next to your current Hex tile to the discard pile and replace it with the top card from the Main deck. You cannot Refresh a card from an Ancient Rune Hex tile or a Dusty Desert Hex tile.&#10;    REROLL: Choose any number of rolled Resource dice and roll them again. You cannot Reroll Cursed Crystals.&#10;    PROTECT: Remove 1 Cursed Crystal from your Resource Pool. Heads up: Any Cursed Crystals remaining in front of you will hurt you at the end of your turn!&#10;    CAST: Spend Resources to use a Spell card effect from your Spell Book. You can use each Spell card effect only once per turn. In addition to an Action point cost, some Actions (such as COLLECT and CAST) require you to spend Resources. Remove spent Resources from your Resource Pool by returning that Resource to the central area of Resource dice and tokens.&#10;&#10;&#10;Phase 3&#10;During this phase, you may absorb any remaining Shadow Fragments in your Resource Pool by moving your Shadow Tracker up by that amount. If you&rsquo;ve absorbed enough Shadow Energy and you are in your Base Form, you may immediately transform into Shadow Form.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;How to WinWhen the dust settles and the echoes of the last spell fade, there can be only one victor.

Previous games: Hornet Leader, Phantom Leader, Thunderbolt-Apache Leader, and U-Boat Leader. As a side note, you can divide up your forces and play co-op with a friend.&#10;&#10;",

In Truck Off, you send your food truck team hoping to score a sweet parking spot at a lucrative venue. Your timing and game plan will be critical to your success while your opponents will look for the perfect opportunity to get you to, ahem, truck off!&#10;&#10;Truck Off is played over five rounds, after which the player with the most money earned wins. In each round, players simultaneously select, then reveal which venue they will park at placing their food trucks next to that venue.  A die is then rolled at each venue to determine how many people actually showed up at each venue.  Each player then simultaneously selects which special action(s) they choose to execute this round. Starting with the first player token, players play and execute one action in a clockwise manner until all actions have been played and executed.  After players are done executing actions, profits are split between each truck at the venue.&#10;&#10;Truck Off gameplay mechanically captures the ups and downs of food truck ownership by rewarding both long-term planning and short-term tactics as well as throwing many curve balls such as low venue attendance, competition, and crazy weather.&#10;&#10;",

Your job is to expand this new city, settling citizens loyal to you alone, as both you and your worthy opponents vie to be declared the first mayor.&#10;&#10;Learning to play The Walled City: Londonderry &amp; Borderlands is easy, but the strategies are endless! In the first round, you will play cards to build roads that divide the city into neighborhoods, then populate them with loyal peasants and nobles who share your view of this new city. In the second round, you will build the walls themselves and choose which nobles will move into the towers to stand guard over the city as Watchmen. Beware, unfinished roads will combine neighborhoods, and gaps in the walls will cause Nobles to flee the city. Scoring is based on area majority: more neighborhoods loyal to you means more votes towards securing your seat on the city council. If you become Mayor, what will your walled city look like?&#10;&#10;There's more to The Walled City than you might have noticed! Inside this box, you'll find two complete games, each with its own flavor. Londonderry introduces players to the famous original Guilds of London, each with its own unique power. Just turn the game board over and you'll visit the Borderlands, a completely new map featuring new game mechanics and an extended selection of Guilds. You can even mix Guild cards between maps!

Sounds easy enough, right? But careful, actions alternate between players and action cards are programmed in reverse order, meaning the last card programmed comes up first. Mastering this is a real challenge. Can you out-think your opponents, guess their moves and get in your own. Or will you out-think yourself and create some hilarious chaos?&#10;&#10;Each player's characters move through a 5x5 building-card grid, which is set up randomly face down each game. The game includes an advanced version with building effects and several variants, giving you even more replay value.&#10;&#10;Are you ready for a duel? Will you plunder for gold?

Everyone starts at 20 points and takes damage over the course of play. The game ends when one player reaches 0, at which time the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;In the original Salvage game, an oil tanker is on fire, and you are part of a rescue team sent to deal with it. You will take damage as you put out the fires, but before the operation begins you can salvage oil as an insurance against the costs you expect to suffer.&#10;&#10;The key dynamic of the game is that before playing a hand you assess the strength of your cards and make a bid of how many points you are prepared to lose not to play the hand. That bid acts as an insurance, and you will be penalized only for points you lose above that bid. However, if everyone's combined bids equal the total amount of damage that can be taken, then everyone loses the amount they bid, and the hands get passed around the table so that other players have a chance to do better with the same hand.&#10;&#10;In St Patrick, you now compete to retain the most life points by using relics to avoid snake bites.&#10;&#10;",

However, other factions are rising to oppose her, each with their own agenda.&#10;&#10;Worldbreakers: Advent of the Khanate is a customizable two-player card game. Players start the game with a Worldbreaker that has a unique special ability and a deck of 30 cards. Each player aims to be the first to reach 10 power, which is gained by developing Location cards and by attacking the opponent.&#10;&#10;The game is divided into rounds, during each of which the players alternate taking turns. A turn is composed of one action, such as gaining mythium (the currency of the game), drawing a card, playing a card, or attacking the opponent. Worldbreakers has three card types: events, followers, and locations. Events are impactful one-time effects. Followers are people who join your cause and can either defend your board or attack your opponent. Finally, Locations are places where mythium can be collected. They have a numbered list of stages, each of which can be developed for a one-time bonus such as power or resources.&#10;&#10;Proper timing and resource management is key to victory: wait too long, and your opponent will mount a crushing attack or finish developing their Locations for a power advantage.

He follows that up by playing a unit, either German or Allied, that was available in the chosen year and could fight in the chosen environment, and the other players subsequently either pass or play a unit (of either nationality) that meets the same conditions.  When all players have made their selections, dice (sometimes) are rolled and totals are compared to determine whether the Germans or the Allies won.  The player who contributed the most to the winning team gets to decide how the convoy and the opposing enemy ships, which are all worth victory points and possibly an increased hand size, are to be distributed amongst the players who were on the winning side.  After twenty convoys have been fought over in this manner, the player with the most victory points' worth of convoys and captured ships wins the game!&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Pacific Typhoon&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "&quot;Storm Above the Reich&quot; is a solitaire wargame depicting a Luftwaffe squadron of Fw190s struggling to deter and destroy the relentless daylight raids over Germany during World War Two. The player&rsquo;s individual aircraft, each represented by a stickered block, must confront the mighty &ldquo;combat box&rdquo; formation of the United States Army Air Force, a deadly terrain of B-24 Liberator heavy bombers. Like its counterpart, Skies Above the Reich, the game is a broad strokes depiction that presents the arc of the desperate air war. Stretching from late 1942 to early 1945, Storm Above the Reich follows that trajectory in a series of missions strung together to make a campaign. Each mission will take a half hour or more to play, while a campaign can last anywhere between 6 to 60 missions.&#10;&#10;Stand-Alone and an Expansion: &quot;Storm Above the Reich&quot; is a stand-alone game; you don&rsquo;t need &quot;Skies Above the Reich&quot; to play. However, it can also serve as an expansion for that game. Storm uses the same rules as Skies, and components in one game transfer seamlessly to the other. Combined, Storm and Skies present eight formation maps, six pursuit maps, B-17s and B-24s. In Storm, you get an oversized staffel of 18 Fw190s, with the option of augmenting it into a Sturmbocke staffel. In Skies, you get a staffel of Bf109s, and with the games combined, the staffels can also be combined.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Brew!&#10;&#10;In Microbrew, players take turns sending brewers to work stations to mash, brew, bottle and serve their own beer recipes to a stream of thirsty customers. Work stations aren't locked out like most other worker placement games - if you really want to push someone out - you can, but their worker goes back to be reused this turn! This means rounds are very dynamic and require careful thought to not just optimize your little team but also to predict where your opponent wants to be so you can ride their wave!&#10;&#10;Brewing isn't just worker placement though - each player has their own &quot;Copper&quot; brewing kettle where their brewer's actions can let them play a simple but fiendish puzzle game to reorganize their kettle and complete a perfect recipe.

Thus, Chandigarh was born.&#10;&#10;In the game Chandigarh, players in the role of urban planners are in charge of building this modern city from scratch. They will construct buildings, try to take advantage of buildings constructed by others, use the abilities of the different municipal employees, and try to position themselves in the key locations of the city, all with the aim of achieving the patterns of the plans they have chosen. Whoever scores the most prestige points wins.&#10;&#10;In more detail, the city of Chandigarh is represented by a 4x4 grid of sector tiles, with each sector having multiple plots. These sectors intersect at junctions, with the edges of these tiles creating streets between the sectors. You each start with a project card that shows an arrangement of buildings, along with two different colored buildings from the four colors available; your architect starts on a junction in the city.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you can move your architect up to the total numbers of footprints on your active project cards, stopping at each junction (if you wish) to place a building from your reserve on an empty plot next to a street that's adjacent to the junction you occupy. If you occupy the final plot of a sector, place one of your supervisors on this tile. Alternatively, on a turn you can choose a new project card from the display, placing it on the left or right side of your row of active project cards and taking buildings from the reserve based on the card you just placed and the card adjacent to it. If you now have four cards in a row, you immediately score the card at the opposite end of the row from the card you just placed. Score the points listed on this card each time the pattern on it occurs in the city.&#10;&#10;Four specialist tokens start in the corners of the city, and if you construct a building of the specialist's color in the sector where they are located, you gain the power of that specialist for the remainder of the game and move them to a different sector. Each specialist has six different abilities, some that score you bonus points and others that give you special powers during play.&#10;&#10;",

You will grow a tree by placing branch cards in clever arrangements, making a happy home for your Kodama!&#10;&#10;Kodama Duo is a card placement game for 2 players that plays in 30 minutes. Players will turn over one Decree card per season to set the unique conditions. During the Growing Phase, players take turns revealing branch cards and splitting them into two piles until each player has added four branch cards to their tree. In the Kodama phase, players will each choose one of their Kodama to score and live in their tree. The game last 3 seasons (12 turns) and whoever cares for their Kodama best will be remembered for generations!&#10;&#10;There are a couple of cool twists on the original Kodama rules for Duo.&#10;&#10;First, instead of a display of branch cards to choose, each turn one player (the splitter) will reveal three branch cards from the deck. They will then split those cards into two piles. The other player (the chooser) will select one of the branch piles. The other pile will go to the splitter. Then, both players will add one of the branch cards they received to their tree. The player who received two branch cards will discard the extra card.&#10;&#10;Second, Duo introduces spirit tokens, which are tokens with the six features from Kodama. After the player that received two branch cards discards one, the other player receives a spirit token from the discarded branch card. They pick one of the features from that card and take the corresponding spirit token. That player then places that token over one of the icons on their tree. This allows interesting scoring interactions as feature chains can be shortened or lengthened to increase the scoring potential for future branch placements.&#10;&#10;Additionally, most of the new Kodama cards and Decree cards interact with the spirit tokens and splitter/chooser mechanic. All of these changes provide an interesting twist on the core mechanics you already love about Kodama.&#10;&#10;Duo also introduces the ability to play Kodama: the Tree Spirits with six players. With this update, we've included new rules for branch selection. Each player will secretly choose from four branch cards simultaneously in a draft format. Players will also be allowed to place and score their branch cards simultaneously. This will shorten the downtime that could have been added by including more players.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Yin and yang is a concept of dualism in ancient Chinese philosophy, representing two opposite principles. Yin is the feminine while Yang is masculine, and this concept is embodied in all things around the world, such as winter and summer, male and female, and light and dark.&#10;&#10;Yin Yang takes players back to ancient China during the Warring State period before the common era. At the time, China was divided into seven kingdoms, fighting each other constantly, and people were living in suffering. To pursue inner peace, every kind of fortune-telling method was then developed.&#10;&#10;One of those fortune-telling methods involves taking a tortoise shell with copper coins inside, then shaking it to have indications based on which coins emerge and how they fall. This method is exactly what Yin Yang is based on. Players act as Taoist priests, traveling on an ancient Chinese map to retrieve the local specialty of different cities to unlock their own destiny. Additionally, players can also build temples in different cities to earn worship from seven kingdoms.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "In 1978 four friends experience a nightmarish ordeal.  Steve, Randy, Ginger, and Dawn innocently set out to camp and enjoy the countryside near a small town on Halloween.  Unfortunately their car breaks down and they meet with pure darkness, the Psycho Raiders, once they are on your trail, they hunt to the death...&#10;&#10;This horrifying halloween night may not be survived.  The true story of what happened on this fateful evening comes alive in the pages and gameplay of Halloween Nightmares.&#10;&#10;Psycho Raiders is a horror simulation experience.  Unlike games that tend to aim for perfect balance, Psycho Raiders' main focus is delivering the terrifying experience that occurred on this Halloween night.   Characters and situations are not balanced to equal one another but created to simulate the actual experience.  The game begins very slanted to the raiders, they will assuredly destroy if fighting just ill prepared campers.  Through the use of finding weapons or alerting the nearby town folk of Crucible, the campers can possibly turn the tables on the raiders.  But there may also be a horrid realization that certain town folk are raiders themselves. The campers may not be able to trust anyone!  It might be best to run! RUN AS FAST AS YOU CAN!&#10;&#10;Psycho Raiders is a tactical hex and counter game with each token representing an individual character. Characters have sheets with some individual stats related to speed, strength and will to live. In the short game, the campers can win if any of them escape the north end of the map while hidden.&#10;&#10;Psycho Raiders is a very visceral experience and we have rated it X. Anyone one under the age of 18 is NOT permitted to play.   Pregnant or players with a fragile or nervous disposition are strongly encouraged NOT TO PLAY THIS GAME!&#10;&#10;GAME COMIC CREATED BY CHARLIE FOGEL!&#10;&#10;Note: Psycho Raiders is the first game featured in our &quot;Halloween Nightmares Horrorgame Magazine&quot;, a game magazine dedicated to Halloween and the Horrorgame genre.  Players will need to xerox elements and provide two D6 and pencils to play this game&#10;&#10;",

Unfortunately, soon after its founding, figures of intrigue nicknamed the &quot;Watchers&quot; appeared all over the realm of Chos&#197;&#143;n. Since then, feud and disorder has sprouted everywhere, but instead of the usual political contests and sneaky manipulations, armed warfare has become the rule. The influence of the &quot;Watchers&quot; on some families has grown strong, and some whisper that their extraordinary powers even allow them to travel through time...&#10;&#10;Chos&#197;&#143;n is a thematic sequel to Kory&#197;&#143; set in the same uchronian and politico-steampunk universe, and gameplay is similar in the two games.&#10;&#10;The game lasts eight rounds, and in each round, each player draws a specified number of cards, then simultaneously plays face down (1) as many characters as desired from one family, (2) one character from each of two different families, (3) one character and one event card, or (4) three event cards. Each family has a value ranging from 1 to 9, which indicates both the number of cards in the family and the number of victory points the player controlling this family will score at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Players reveal their cards in order clockwise from the round's start player. If she played one character and one event, she carries out the power of this event, swapping two characters or eliminating one held by another player. She also carries out the powers of any family that she controls, i.e., that she holds more cards of than any other player. The family powers let you protect one family, keep event cards, double the power of an event, steal the first player token, etc. At the end of each round, players discard characters in play (if needed) and discard everything in hand.&#10;&#10;After eight rounds, players tally their scores based on the families they control, influence scored during the game, and possession of Yi's Legacy, which is acquired by playing three event cards. Whoever has the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;",

The game models the full order of battle that could be expected in 1980&rsquo;s wartime, from multi-regiment Soviet Tu-22 Backfire bombers to multiple US carrier groups.&#10;&#10;The game is card driven, with each card providing points to move units or trigger special events such as &lsquo;KGB Assassinations&rsquo; and &lsquo;Space Shuttle&rsquo;. There is also a reaction mechanic where most cards can be used in the other player&rsquo;s turn to perform a spoiling event such as &lsquo;Raid Aborts&rsquo; and &lsquo;Friendly Fire&rsquo;.&#10;&#10;The heart of the game is detection. Task Forces can only be attacked once detected. By contrast, land air-bases can always be attacked &ndash; their enemy knows where they are. The race to detect opposing Task Forces begins as soon as they enter potential striking range of units such as the formidable Soviet bomber formations, or perhaps the Soviet&rsquo;s submarine fleet which, whilst it has considerable strength, cannot effectively detect enemy forces without help from its comrades.&#10;&#10;NATO must not only deliver convoys, but also protect its allies! Norway will be hard pressed, as will Denmark. Both will require urgent reinforcement. In the Mediterranean Sea, Soviet forces must be halted by naval aviation strikes. In the deeper seas, NATO may enact it&rsquo;s promised attack on the Soviet nuclear deterrent and the Soviets may attempt to respond. Perhaps the Typhoon SSBNs will flee under the Arctic ice to await doomsday, or hole-up in the White Sea. Perhaps the Soviets will use nuclear weapons and scatter those NATO forces that are no-doubt determined to bomb the Soviet&rsquo;s Kola Peninsula bases.&#10;&#10;The game models Politburo approval (Soviet leadership) through a stability mechanism, and whether the Soviets feel they can reduce New York to cinders through the use of &lsquo;First Strike Points&rsquo; &ndash; these allow the use of things like chemical or nuclear weapons.

The map scope includes the main city and the its suburbs from Lateschanka to Kuspornoe, along 30 km of the volga river, and extends to the west as far as Gumrak Airfield, Orlovka, and Alexandrovka. Map scale is 1:33000, with hexes that represent 1,1 kilometer along each side.&#10;&#10;The wooden-block units in the game represent regiments for the Germans (with some assault battalions) and brigades/divisions for the Soviets.&#10;&#10;The game has one campaign, covering August 23 to November 20 and taking from 1 to 2 hours  to play. There are several shorter scenarios in development, such as the September attack to the southern part of the city and the October attack to the industrial sector.&#10;&#10;The unit wooden blocks provide fog-of-war and easy recording of strength, while a card-driven system that allows for key historical events and dramatic surprises in battle...&#10;&#10;The game offers FOUR different modes of play:&#10;&#10;Solitaire (German player versus Soviet AI)&#10;Cooperative (two German players vs Soviet AI)&#10;Competitive:2 (German player vs Soviet Player)&#10;Competitive:3 (two German players vs Soviet Player)&#10;&#10;Complexity level is medium/high.&#10;&#10;The game is played out over a detailed 84x60 cm (33&quot;x24&quot;), laminated multicolor mapboard.

    "description": "&quot;The only thing that ever frightened me during the war was the U-Boat peril.&quot; - Winston Churchill&#10;&#10;The Battle of the Atlantic was the longest continuous campaign of World War II running from 1939 through to the defeat of Germany in 1945. It involved thousands of ships, stretched over hundreds of miles of ocean, and involved hundreds of convoy battles and single-ship encounters. During the struggle advantage switched back and forth between the U-boats and Allies as new weapons, tactics, and countermeasures were developed and implemented.&#10;&#10;U-Boat Leader takes the Leader series to new depths, letting players control a group of U-boats on missions in the Atlantic. The core system of the game will be familiar to players of other Leader games, allowing them to quickly get into the game.&#10;&#10;A major portion of the game is determining where to send your submarines. Do you concentrate your submarines in one or two areas to form wolfpacks or spread them out in the shipping lanes to increase the chances of finding contacts, or do you send them on special missions (such as mine-laying)? You can also spend Special Operations Points to support your submarines by adding search planes to help find enemy ships or by sending supply ships and subs (Milk Cows) to extend the endurance of the submarines. During longer campaigns you need to manage the U-boat patrol rotation to keep subs on station.&#10;&#10;When a patrolling U-boat comes into contact with an enemy force it can call other boats in the same patrol zone to form a wolfpack or attack alone. The action then shifts to the tactical display where the U-boats try to close with and attack merchants while avoiding the escorting warships. When an attack starts you will have an idea of the number and general type of ships in the group, but you have to close with the ships to actually identify the ships.&#10;&#10;U-Boat Leader includes the following type of U-boats: &#10;Type IIB/C coastal submarines &#10;Type VII A/B/C Atlantic submarines&#10;Type IX A/B/C long-range submarines&#10;Type XXI Elektro-boat&#10;&#10;U-Boat Leader includes four campaigns covering different stages of the Battle of the Atlantic:&#10;&#10;The Battle Begins: covering operations at the start of World War II to about mid-1940.&#10;&#10;The Happy Time: covering the period from mid-1940 to mid-1941 when the U-boats and wolfpacks dominated the seas.&#10;&#10;Operation Drumbeat: covering operations off the American coast and in the Caribbean in early 1942.&#10;&#10;The Hunted: covering the time period when the tide starts to turn against the U-boats.&#10;&#10;-Dan Verssen Games&#10;&#10;Other Leader series games by Dan Verssen&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "For those with the eldritch gift, temptation lurks around every corner, even in leisure. Just consider the possibilities available to the practitioner of magic. Imagine poker with spells! No person could resist such temptation, and even a casual review of history will prove that none could.&#10;&#10;&#10;    The famous last play of Ephippus of Athens? It was about Circe&rsquo;s never ending thirst for cheating at cards. &#10;    Morgan le Fay and Merlin regularly crossed wits over a deck. &#10;    Roger Bollingbroke&rsquo;s most heinous crime was the transparently bogus run of five straight flushes in a row. &#10;&#10;&#10;And so it has gone. The application of magic to card games is as natural as mixing mandrake and worm&rsquo;s husk.&#10;&#10;For the first time, however, the rules for a game specifically created for wizards have been pieced together from fragments found in tombs, dusty used bookstores, and in the classified ads of one small newspaper. Though magic has largely been forgotten in the centuries since this game was invented, modern game design has given us a way to imitate the arcana outlined in the reconstructed rules. The result is a &ldquo;no-magic-required&rdquo; whimsical romp for 2-5 players.&#10;&#10;Hocus places the players in the flamboyant boots of wizards, using their powerful advantages to create opportunities, manipulate the game, and alter the flow of cards. Wizards hate being pinned down and live by the mantra &ldquo;You shall not fold!&rdquo; Each turn, players choose one Spell to use. As you are new to Hocus, we shall first discuss the three Basic Spells.&#10;&#10;Use the first basic Spell to play cards to the Community. Play thoughtfully, as everyone shares the cards in the Community! The second Spell is for building the Pot. In addition to Suit and Strength, every card has a point value. Cards played to the Pot contribute their points to the winner of each Showdown. Play cards to build a Pocket with the third Spell. (Never ask to see a wizard&rsquo;s pocket!) Each player takes one of their Pockets and combines it with the Community to form a hand during Showdowns. The best hand claims all points in the Pot.&#10;&#10;There is, of course, a twist. Trust a wizard to provide a twist! There are multiple Communities, each with a Pot, and players can compete in multiple Showdowns if they have the Pockets. Hocus is not merely a matter of building good hands, but making a winning hand where your opponents least expect and profiting with a hefty Pot. Timing and careful, targeted play will win the day. And time is limited. You may have conjured a Straight Flush, but it&rsquo;s worthless with no points in the Pot!&#10;&#10;Now, look at the other spells in the game. There are eight different spell books, each with their own unique approaches to the game, providing every wizard who plays with their own special abilities. The spell books raise the game to another level, with even more tools for bending luck to your advantage.&#10;&#10;Travel way back to a dark, dank inn, shuffle the cards, and play the favorite game of the legendary Merlin and Morgan le Fay. Hocus is a little like poker, but a lot more magic!&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Become the head of a Great House of Luthadel in this game of negotiation and betrayal set in the world of Brandon Sanderson's Mistborn novels. Contend with myriad problems plaguing the Final Empire &mdash; rampaging koloss, disease, social unrest, even the heroes of the novels &mdash; and with every step jockey for the Lord Ruler's favor. At the end of the story, will you rise to power and prestige &mdash; or fall in ruin and disgrace?&#10;&#10;Mistborn: House War is a resource-management game set during the events of the first Mistborn novel. Three to five players assume the roles of various factions and must work together to solve the &quot;Problems&quot; facing the Final Empire. In order to solve these problems players must expend a certain combination of resources, but in return they receive Favor from the Lord Ruler.&#10;&#10;Each round, players produce resources (food, money, prestige, skaa, warriors, and atium) in different proportions and combinations based on their faction. You can convert between different resources to get something that is missing, but in the long run the players must work together, pooling their resources, to succeed.&#10;&#10;There are four tiers of &quot;Problems&quot;; at the start of each turn a problem is added to the board in the corresponding column and each pre-existing problem moves up one tier. If a problem passes tier 4, than it is said to &quot;Erupt&quot; (a reference to the novel) and it causes various problems for the players, such as increasing the level of &quot;Unrest&quot; or giving players &quot;Disfavor&quot;. The main part of gameplay is the negotiation between players to solve these problems. Anything except Favor gained in previous turns can be negotiated: resources, Personality cards (which can have a variety of effects), out-of-game favors, etc.&#10;&#10;The game can end in two ways, either the Unrest reaches 8 or a special problem card (Vin) is resolved. If she is not defeated and is allowed to erupt she increases the Unrest by 4. If the players are able to defeat Vin, then the player who has the highest amount of Favor wins. If the Unrest reaches 8, then the rebellion occurs and the player with the least Favor (the faction furthest from the Lord Ruler) wins.&#10;&#10;",

Each player's path is unique &mdash; and only you know the way. However, you cannot traverse the forest alone. Your teammates are needed to open the sealed portals along each step. Give clever clues, hope your teammates can read your mind, and complete your journey!&#10;&#10;To complete the journey, each player takes a turn providing clues about which portal is their next step. Each step can have up to five different portals, but only one is the correct one, so players give clues that relate (hopefully) to the correct next step.&#10;&#10;The challenge is that the only clues available are cards that have been dealt, so sometimes the clues may not relate to the next portal of a journey, which means you have to get creative. This is where you need to try to read the minds of your teammates. For example, the next portal on your journey could be the word &quot;anteater&quot;, and your clues are limited to cards you are dealt, like scary, or tall, or handsome. Which would you choose as your clue?&#10;&#10;The game takes place in five rounds. Beat the game by having everyone complete their own journey before the five rounds are over.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;&#10;Microbadges:   &#10;&#10;",

Imagine you are a mighty lord commanding an army. Or a magician summoning creatures onto a battlefield. Or a farmer who grows his units on a cornfield right in the storm of battle. So you build your army, choose your enemy and try to bring the pain to him, before he brings the pain to you.&#10;&#10;Between you and your enemy there are 2 tracks: one that your armies use to travel towards enemy, and a similar one where your enemy&rsquo;s units travel to you. Again, just imagine whatever you want &ndash; two epic castles in a war or a slow, magic-fest between old, smelly wizards with rheumatism.&#10;&#10;Cards are everything here: your life bar, your mana, your library and so on. When you draw them into your hand you can either play them or discard them to pay for some more expensive, fancy card&rsquo;s cost. But there are even more decisions from here!&#10;&#10;When you play a card, you can play it as an instant and get a trigger effect. Alternatively, you can play it as a creature on your track, then its passive ability will work. It will defend you at first, and once it moves up to the end of your track, it will be able to:&#10;a)    Activate (attack and trigger its effect)&#10;b)    Become your supporter (our fancy term for mana) &#10;c)    Or stay in the middle of the track and make its passive ability work all the time&#10;&#10;So, you can build powerful combos, you can zombie-rush, you can build your economy and all sorts of other cool stuff. But whenever your enemy hits you, you will lose cards from your resources, so there is that. No cards to draw? You lose.&#10;&#10;If you like it we might even get some expansions going pretty soon.&#10;&#10;A co-op mode has also been added.&#10;&#10;",

On your turn, you play a card that allows you to either land a shuttle on a docking bay or take off from one. The shuttle will transport raw materials either from the asteroid or to your freighters. Each docking bay has a special ability if activated that turn, like ore processing or galactic traders. At this foundry, you must also build a fleet of freighters to haul your items. To do this, you must visit the cantina to recruit help from various alien captains (with unique abilities). Once everyone has played all of their cards, it's time to head off to a new board...&#10;&#10;At Space Foundry Beta, you take all of your acquired materials and transport them down to the station. There the robots will use that material to make various products of varying worth. Besides manufacturing, you may also upgrade your freighters or charge up your existing products for more points. Once the freighters are filled back up again, it's time to transport the items to their final destination for final scoring!&#10;&#10;",
