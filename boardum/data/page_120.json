    "description": "Hexpanse is a fast, hexagon based tactical board game. In the game players are interstellar commanders and warlords who are battling for different planets. The players can win the game in two ways: &#10;1. The player defeats the opponent&rsquo;s commander(s).&#10;2. The player builds up the 9 units long pattern (a unique formation) which is selected randomly from the pattern deck at the beginning of the game.&#10;&#10;During the game the players basically use their own soldiers, however, if they want they can deploy characters and special ally faction units on the planet surface. They can also use special action cards to get more units, speed, wealth or fire power.&#10;&#10;On every turn, the players do the following things in order:&#10;1. Their wealth growth based on their influence.&#10;2. The player can select 2 from the following actions:&#10;- Place a unit or a character on the planet board &#10;- Take a unit back from the planet board&#10;- Take one of your units back from the waste.&#10;- Attack with one of your units or characters.&#10;- Increase your wealth.&#10;- Increase your influence.&#10;- Move your commander to an adjacent place by paying a heal point.&#10;- Use your commander&rsquo;s skill by paying a heal point.&#10;- Heal your commander by 1.&#10;3. Buy cards from the market.&#10;4. Fill up the market up to 5 cards.&#10;&#10;",

As soon as the card is revealed, players must race to place the microbes (and superbug, if present) in their petri dish. What's more, they must figure out which microbes (and possibly the superbug) to place in their petri dish based on this rule: The superbug must always be a different shape and color than the other three microbes in your dish! Whoever fills their dish with the proper items first claims the challenge card, and whoever first grabs five cards wins the game!&#10;&#10;As a variant, you can play with the purple virus, which starts the game in the large petri dish that contains all of the other bits. You can grab this purple virus and place it in the petri dish of your left-hand neighbor, then that person can pass it left, etc. You can't end the round if the purple virus is in your petri dish! Whoever has the purple virus in their dish at the end of the round must give one of their previously collected cards to that round's winner.&#10;&#10;",

The game is divided up into 2 separate rounds.&#10;&#10;In the first round, each player takes turns being the judge. The faces-line-up board is filled with 6 male faces. Then the judge reads an impressions card aloud. It will say something like &quot;The Republican&quot; or &quot;The one who just ate something sour.&quot; Then the judge chooses which numbered face best fits the description and places that numbered card facedown on the table, and all the other players try to match the judge's number. Players that matched the judge move one space, and the judge moves one space for each player that matched. Then the selected face is replaced, and the judgeship passes to the next player. Once everyone has been the judge twice for Male faces, you do the same for Female faces, and then for Animal faces. The first round ends when everyone has been the judge 6 times (2 for each type of face.)&#10;&#10;In the second round, the number cards are put aside and players are dealt a hand made up of 2 Male, 2 Female, and 2 Animal faces. Players again take turns being the judge, and the judge again reads an Impressions card. Then the judge looks away and the other players put out a face from their hand that they think best matches the description. Once all the choices are out, the judge selects the best one. The player who played that face moves 3 spaces.&#10;&#10;The game ends as soon as someone makes it to the finish space. That player is the winner&#10;&#10;",

On your turn pick a passenger from the waiting line and place them in your carriage. Sounds easy, right? Not necessarily. In order to win you need to concentrate and control the constantly changing situation on the board. Observing the actions of other players, adjusting your strategy to the current round and making sure you fill individual passengers' preferences shows that becoming a manager of an aerial train is not an easy task.&#10;&#10;The game uses familiar mechanisms such as pattern building, set collection, tile placement and action selection and merges them into a fun experience for everyone! It&rsquo;s sure to appeal to fans of games such as Azul, Sagrada and Reef.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to have the most victory points after 3 rounds. At the end of every round each player sums up all the points they earned in 3 different ways:&#10;&#10;GOALS&#10;SERVICES&#10;PERSONAS&#10;&#10;On their turn players pick a passenger from the current waiting line to then place in their carriage. Additionally, the player may also perfom actions and aquire SERVICE tiles.&#10;&#10;There are 6 types of passengers in the game. For example, one passenger is considered a PERSONA and has a specific preference tile that goes along with them. The Preference tile indicates where the PERSONA would like to be seated and what passengers they&rsquo;d like to sit with. Fulfill the Persona's preferences and earn big points!&#10;&#10;Every round has 2 GOALS that give victory points if fulfilled.&#10;&#10;For every full compartment players receives a ticket token. Once they've acquired 2 ticket tokens they can then spend them to buy a SERVICE tile. A SERVICE tile gives victory points for every pair of passengers of the types shown on the tile.&#10;&#10;A round ends once all passengers from the Main Hall have been placed in the players' carriages. Players sum up their victory points and the next round begins with new passengers filling up the Main Hall. The game ends after the scoring phase of round 3.

    "description": "This board game is dedicated to the people of Taiwan and those who care about Taiwan.&#10;&#10;In the closing stages of World War II, when Taiwan was still a Japanese colony, more than one hundred U.S. B-24 bombers launched an air raid on Taihoku (Taipei). Political and military facilities were the main targets, but civilians were also affected. Many homes were destroyed, and  a large number of people were killed or wounded.&#10;&#10;Raid on Taihoku takes you back to Taiwan in 1945. In the midst of war, you must cooperate to survive. You will be fettered and will face difficult choices. We must persevere until the war is over. Win together or lose together!&#10;&#10;&#229;&#143;&#176;&#229;&#140;&#151;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#231;&#169;&#186;&#232;&#165;&#178;&#10;&#10;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#143;&#176;&#230;&#185;&#190;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#229;&#143;&#176;&#230;&#185;&#190;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#132;&#155;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#229;&#143;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#230;&#141;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#144;&#10;&#231;&#172;&#172;&#228;&#186;&#140;&#230;&#172;&#161;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#230;&#136;&#166;&#228;&#184;&#173;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#230;&#151;&#165;&#230;&#156;&#172;&#231;&#181;&#177;&#230;&#178;&#187;&#228;&#184;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#143;&#176;&#230;&#185;&#190;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#231;&#153;&#190;&#230;&#169;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#232;&#182;&#133;&#227;&#129;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#231;&#136;&#134;&#230;&#146;&#131;&#230;&#169;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#143;&#176;&#229;&#140;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#232;&#165;&#178;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#229;&#144;&#140;&#231;&#155;&#159;&#232;&#187;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#230;&#148;&#191;&#230;&#178;&#187;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#232;&#187;&#141;&#228;&#186;&#139;&#229;&#187;&#186;&#231;&#175;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#155;&#174;&#230;&#168;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#232;&#162;&#171;&#229;&#174;&#179;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#230;&#176;&#145;&#233;&#150;&#147;&#230;&#150;&#189;&#232;&#168;&#173;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#229;&#143;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#179;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#229;&#145;&#168;&#232;&#190;&#186;&#229;&#174;&#182;&#229;&#177;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#230;&#144;&#141;&#229;&#163;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#151; &#229;&#164;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#173;&#187;&#232;&#128;&#133;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#130;&#170;&#229;&#164;&#162;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#228;&#184;&#173;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#229;&#144;&#155;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#229;&#174;&#182;&#230;&#151;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#230;&#136;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#239;&#188;&#159;&#233;&#160;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#232;&#135;&#170;&#229;&#136;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#139; &#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#229;&#164;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#239;&#188;&#159;&#232;&#170;&#176;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#230;&#172;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#154; &#229;&#174;&#182;&#230;&#151;&#143;&#229;&#133;&#168;&#229;&#147;&#161;&#231;&#148;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#230;&#174;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#227;&#128;&#142;Raid on Taihoku&#227;&#128;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#140;1945&#229;&#185;&#180;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#143;&#176;&#230;&#185;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#184;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#229;&#144;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#232;&#170;&#152;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#230;&#136;&#166;&#228;&#186;&#137;&#228;&#184;&#173;&#227;&#129;&#175; &#229;&#138;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#144;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#176;&#233;&#155;&#163;&#233;&#150;&#162;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#170;&#129;&#231;&#160;&#180;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#232;&#182;&#179;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#229;&#144;&#155;&#227;&#129;&#175; &#231;&#169;&#182;&#230;&#165;&#181;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#233;&#129;&#184;&#230;&#138;&#158;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#232;&#191;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#230;&#136;&#166;&#228;&#186;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#231;&#181;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#143;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#167; &#229;&#131;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#231;&#148;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#230;&#153;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#231;&#183;&#146; &#232;&#178;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#230;&#153;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#231;&#183;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#160;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "From the publisher:&#10;&#10;The Red Dragon Inn: Gambling I'm In! is a game about the games that the heroes play when they gamble at the Red Dragon Inn. Now, players of The Red Dragon Inn, The Red Dragon Inn 2, The Red Dragon Inn 3, and The Red Dragon Inn 4 can play out an actual round of gambling when they play the &quot;Gambling? I'm In!&quot; card! Even better, the gambling games also can be played on their own as standalone games, or as part of your RPG, or LARP. The game will come with a 93 card Rogues and Warriors Deck, a bunch of 6 sided dice, coin tokens, debt and loan tokens and rules for at least 7 games! Some of the games use dice. Some of the games use cards from the Rogues and Warriors Deck, and some of the games use dice and cards.&#10;&#10;This card deck was developed as a stand-alone game as well as a possible replacement to the gambling component in Red Dragon Inn 1 and 2.&#10;&#10;The deck consists of 90 cards. The deck is broken down into three colors (rust, green, and blue) with 6 different symbols. The card faces feature 1 Knight, 2 Ladys, 3 Bards, 4 Merchants, and 5 Rogues per card symbol. There is a die symbol on each card with a number of pips equal to the number of cards of its type and a set of symbols on the right that denote character superiority in certain game variations. Some games with this deck involve 6 D6 dice (not included).&#10;&#10;There are five base games included and are as follows:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Rogues and Warriors - Similar to two card poker, each player is dealt two cards. You compare these two cards to the symbols on the right to determine how powerful your hand is.&#10;     Threes - Uses all dice, no cards. &#10;     Jack of All Trades - Uses 5 dice and only the Rogue and Warrior cards. The theme is putting your workers to work and using the cards and dice to complete jobs.&#10;     Den of Thieves - No dice. Hands are dealt and players use the special abilities of each character to influence hand weight and scoring.&#10;     The Wheel (and The Clock) - No dice. Players try to guess what cards others are collecting in order to gain points and win the round.&#10;&#10;&#10;When combined with The Red Dragon games, when a player plays the &quot;Gambling, I'm in!&quot; card, the player may decide to choose any game from the list to play instead of the normal gambling rules. Special rules are included for each variation when combining this with the normal game.&#10;&#10;There will be other variations available as Slugfest has invited players to create their own games with the deck and the ones deemed best will be included in later rules updates.&#10;&#10;",

There are over 200 different pieces in the universe, each with its special function.&#10; Stratego Legends is an &quot;optionally collectible&quot; game. Each box comes with a light army and a dark army whose pieces have been chosen to work well together. However, there are rules for customizing armies (and the lands they fight upon) to specialize your attack force. There are also rules for multiplayer games where 4, 6, or 8 players can square off as two teams.&#10;&#10;",

The first player who places the fourth different form in a row, column or zone wins the game immediately, no matter who owns the other pieces of that winning move.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Solitaire game of German Zeppelin operations in WWI that plays like a really sophisticated side-scrolling arcade game. The board shows a side view of the airspace over war-torn Europe (or in one scenario, Africa). The counter representing your Zeppelin remains in a central &quot;Zeppelin corridor,&quot; or column, shifting up or down as it gains and loses altitude; forward movement is marked by moving every other card and counter on the board left or right relative to your Zepp.&#10;&#10;A typical scenario has you playing through 30 randomly dealt &quot;Situation Cards,&quot; which represent enemy units, weather conditions, and the odd mountain encountered on the way to and from your primary target. The first 10 cards represent the trip out; the second 10, time over the target area; and the final 10, the trip home, by which point you will likely be damaged and running low on ballast and gas.&#10;&#10;A separate &quot;ballast sheet,&quot; or Zeppelin schematic, is used to keep track of the condition of your craft and crew. Five different Zeppelin models are provided, from the Type M converted passenger liner to the mammoth Type X &quot;war Zeppelin.&quot;&#10;&#10;The game's components are a step above desktop publishing quality; cards and counters must be cut apart before play. The game provides ten scenarios, plus a campaign game and variant rules for two players. An expansion set,  featuring Riesenflugzeugabteilungen oversized bomber planes in place of Zeppelins, is also available.  A second expansion set ZRCV which introduces US airships in the pacific as well.&#10;&#10;Sierra Madre Games combind Luftschiff and ZRCV into a single game called Airships at War 1914-1941 as a 2nd edition of the game in 2005.   A 3rd edition of the game is published by Sonic Quill Publications and is currently available for sale as of 2023 from rjwargames.com.&#10;&#10;Expanded by&#10;&#10;    Riesenflugzeugabteilungen&#10;    Airships at War 1914-1941&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "End of the Trail is a competitive card game for 1-4 prospectors and fortune seekers. Players manage a hand of cards to secure transportation, prospect land, and take a shot at winning a title to more land at the poker table. Cards have three uses, each corresponding to a particular phase of the game: to prospect land tiles and discover how much gold a claim will produce, to collect and play cards that build a good poker hand, and to purchase additional cards in auction to help with prospecting, poker, or both.&#10;&#10;Prospecting land is a risky business. Players must choose their cards carefully, as they have limited chances to discover the most bountiful sources of gold.  Each time they play a card and peek at a land tile, they must decide if they will stake a claim, placing their prospector&rsquo;s tent, or if they will press their luck and try to find a better claim.  But if a new land tile that they peek at produces less gold than their most previous inspected tile, the player&rsquo;s luck has run out, and they are forced to accept the less bountiful claim.&#10;&#10;In the California Gold Rush, fortunes were won and lost at the poker table.  At the end of each round, players must select two of the cards they played for prospecting and add them to the stud poker hand in front of them on the table.  At the end of the game, players reveal their poker hands.  The player with the best poker hand wins another claim, placing their fourth and final prospector&rsquo;s tent on a land tile.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, all hidden values  are revealed and players add up the gold of their various claims.  The player with the most gold wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The sudden invasion of these monstrous creatures brought unprecedented threat to the entire world.

To avoid annihilation, all kingdoms were forced to set aside their long hatred towards each other and joined the line to fight for the survival of mankind.&#10;&#10;Dark Age Z is a strategic board game for 2 to 5 players.

It is a two-player game, with one player controlling the American and British forces and the other the German and Italian forces.&#10;&#10;The maps display the harsh terrain of French North Africa, from the wooded coastal region to the mountainous inland region into the sand dune and wadi infested wastelands of the Sahara Desert. The maps cover North Africa from the Safi-Casablanca region to Tripoli in Libya; they include the Allied and Axis base areas in Gibraltar, Southern Sardinia, and Western Sicily.&#10;&#10;The counters represent the diverse forces engaged in North Africa: American, British, Free French, German, Indian, Italian, New Zealander, and Vichy French. Ground forces range in strength from armored divisions down to commando battalions. Air units represent groups of 40 to 50 aircraft; with both sides committing the best available aircraft, German Fw 190A's and Me 109G's fight for air superiority against British Spitfire IX's and American P-38G's.&#10;&#10;The rules are the Europa rules for desert warfare; they are the same as the rules to Western Desert, with additions for the special features of Operation Torch. The rules cover the important elements of operations in Africa: armor effects, antitank abilities, supply considerations, air power, and shipping troops and supplies. Special operations in the campaign are covered in detail: parachute drops, amphibious landings, and commando actions. Political rules cover the volatile situation in French North Africa: the Vichy French army's response in North Africa can range from full co-operation with the Allies to determined resistance to the invasion.&#10;&#10;Torch is playable by itself or in combination with the other Europa game on North Africa: Western Desert. In fact, the rules set, titled War in the Desert, provides the rules, charts, and orders of battle for the entire North African and Near Eastern theater of World War II. The rules link three Europa games - Western Desert, The Near East, and Torch - to show the struggle for this theatre from December 1940 through May 1943. A seperate rules set includes the instructions and orders of battle for playing Torch by itself.&#10;&#10;Game Components:&#10;&#10;    480 Die Cut Counters (Europa sheet #44, 45)&#10;    Two 20&quot; x 26&quot; Maps (Europa maps )&#10;    One War in the Desert Rules and Chart Set&#10;    One Operation Torch Rules and Chart Set &#10;&#10;&#10;",

The goal of the game is to be the player who collects the most points by using their excellent memory skills!&#10;&#10;Players try to collect sequential numbers of each different type of fruit, but they can collect only one sequence of each type, so they can compile at most seven different sequences. You can collect these sequences in any order you like, but you cannot look at any of your cards once you have collected them. Your aim is to collect all five cards in sequence of coconuts, papayas, figs, avocados, pomegranates and pineapples (or all seven cards in the case of passion fruit), but don't duplicate the numbers you collect or you won't score anything!&#10;&#10;Fruit Passion is #15 in the E-G-G series of small box games.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Try to remember all the fruit you've grabbed in GY&Uuml;MI G&eacute;niusz (FRUTTA! Genius or GYUMI Genius) to maximize your score!To set up the game, shuffle the fruit cards, then create three face-down decks of approximately equal size, then turn one card face up to start a discard pile. The deck contains fruit cards of seven types, with six types of fruit (coconut, papaya, fig, avocado, pineapple, and pomegranate) being numbered from 1-5 while passion fruit is numbered 1-7. The ratio of identical cards differs by fruit type.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you take one of two actions: Draw the top card from one of the decks, or draw the top card from the discard pile. If you draw from a deck and don't want the card, place it on the discard pile. Otherwise, start a pile with that type of fruit or place that card on top of any other cards of that type that you already have. (Thus, you can have at most seven piles.) Splay the cards in each pile upward so that you (and everyone else) can see how many cards of each type you've collected, but with the number of only the topmost card of each pile being visible. If the discard pile is emptied because people keep taking the cards, flip over one card to start a new discard pile.&#10;&#10;When all three decks have run out, the game ends once the player holding the final card discards it or adds it to their collection. Players then score points for each type of fruit they've collected, but fruits score only from 1 up in consecutive order. If you have 1-2-3-4-5 of pineapple, for example, you score 11 points, whereas if you have 1-2-4-5 of fig, you score only 3 points since only the 1-2 count. If you fail to get a 1 in a fruit or you duplicate a number in a fruit sequence, then you score 0 points for that fruit!&#10;&#10;Some cards have special colored numbers on them, and with these you can create a cross-fruit sequence as the coconut has the 1, the papaya the 2, and so on. As long as these &quot;genius&quot; numbers are in valid fruit sequences, then you'll score points for this genius sequence, too. Whoever scores the most points wins.&#10;&#10;Note: GY&Uuml;MI G&eacute;niusz supports 5 players while Fruit Passion supports 4, however both have the same number of cards.&#10;&#10;",

Starting with X, players take turns placing L-, I-, T-, and S-shaped tetrominoes from a shared supply onto the board. There are three restrictions:&#10;&#10;1. Every new piece must share an edge with at least one of the pieces already on the board.&#10;2. No two congruent pieces may share an edge. (Pieces of the same shape are color-coded as an aid.)&#10;3. No four cells in a 2x2 arrangement may all be covered by pieces.&#10;&#10;The pie rule is used: after X makes the first move, O may choose to switch places with X instead of placing a piece.&#10;&#10;Each player tries to cover their opponent's symbols while protecting their own symbols. When no more pieces can be played, whoever has more of their symbol showing on the board wins. In the event of a tie score, the player who made the last move wins.&#10;&#10;",

Then he can discover locations, load resources, and deliver them in Lisbon to gain victory points.

Finally, he picks new cards until he has 4 motion cards in his hand and the turn passes to the next player.&#10;&#10;The game is much simpler than &quot;Caravelas&quot; (1st version) in several aspects. There are less components. Only 4 pages of rules (instead of 16). Caravels move only on predetermined routes. Number of moves is determined by the motion cards (instead of depending on the route followed by the ship). There are no event cards. Management of the ships is simplified.

The player with the most VP in the end wins.&#10;&#10;Each player gets one Kitty card in each round and tries to be the first to create the patterns shown on the cards. Since this is a recognize-and-react game, all players act simultaneously. In more detail:&#10;&#10;&#10;    All players put one hand in the center of the table and shout out &quot;Kitty Paw!&quot; to start the game.&#10;    Each player grabs one Kitty card from the row and places it in front of themselves. Then players grab Kitty tiles from the center of the table and arrange them to match the patterns shown on their own Kitty card. &#10;    Using only one hand, the &quot;Kitty Paw&quot; they placed in the center of the table at the start of the game, players grab only one Kitty tile at a time instead of grabbing a bunch of tiles. &#10;    If any player thinks that she has completed the pattern on her Kitty card, she shouts out &quot;Meow!&quot; and performs the &quot;Lucky Cat&quot; gesture.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The first player to gain control of their entire field wins.&#10;  &#10;Players recruit animals, promote leaders, purchase equipment, find locations, enlist legendary animals, and befriend human allies.  Players also keep track of two tallies during the game: Favor and Fury.  Favor indicates how much 'pull' you have with humanity.  Fury indicates how much of a threat humanity sees you as.  Fury is gained by attacking your opponents.  Gaining Fury can allow you to take advantage of sinister 'Dark Nature' cards, but gaining too much can eliminate you from the game.&#10;&#10;This Battle Box features two 70-card faction decks: City and Suburb.&#10;City animals are tough and maintain close ties with humanity.

The objective of the game is for the Germans to capture Crete at the lowest possible cost in terms of casualties. You have the option to maneuver German units as you desire within the rules&rsquo; allowances. But, when a rule calls for the Allies to do something, you the player must execute that action.&#10;&#10;There are two general types of turns in the game: Preparation and Operational. Preparation turns gives the players additional Operations Points (markers) that can be used to enhance actions, as well as refitting reduced units. In Operational turns, the player executes movement and combat with German forces.&#10;The map shows Crete and the surrounding seas, with displays representing the German staging areas in mainland Greece and each unit represents anything from a battalion to a brigade.&#10;&#10;World at War Magazine #47, April-May 2016.&#10;&#10;Components: One 22&quot; x 34&quot; map &amp; 176 counters&#10;&#10;",

The game takes place in a 3-layered mountain of tiles- as you play the game, you&rsquo;ll reveal more tiles to mine. You&rsquo;ll also break down the mountain as you play, so watch your step! A randomized board setup means that no two games will play out the same way, and the mountain will crumble differently every time.&#10;&#10;Each turn, players will perform two actions with each of their bears. All bears can move to an adjacent hex, and work together to mine adjacent tiles. Tiles are worth honey, which are used to buy more bears and play bonus cards, or royal jelly, which are used as victory points. As bears mine deeper in the mountain, the tiles will get more valuable, but also more difficult to mine. Players draw bonus cards into their hand at the end of each turn, which move tiles and bears around the mountain, and foil your opponent's plans. When the deck runs out, the game ends, and the player with the most royal jelly wins!&#10;&#10;",

Whoever ends up with the most reputation wins the bet and the game.&#10;&#10;In more detail, each player starts with a few randomly-dealt knowledge cards, with these cards corresponding to some of the eight legendary locations: Atlantis, Himalayas, the pyramids of Egypt, and so on. On a turn, a character moves to a location of their choice, spending time to do based on what shows on the game board. At each location, the player can either collect additional knowledge (i.e. cards, with the player collecting cards based on the method showing at the specific location) or discard cards that match this location in order to place a diary token in their color on this space; the more cards they discard, the more points they might possibly earn.&#10;&#10;Those points are only possible points because four times during the 75 weeks, the Club members meet again in London to compare their knowledge about the legends, and because time is at a premium, only the five most promising stories can be told. What stories will these be? Well, in game terms, one of the places that players can visit while traveling is Club headquarters in London, and here players can drop cards that they've collected. During the scoring phase, these cards are shuffled, then five different locations revealed &mdash; and these five locations are the only ones that score. Thus, the more often you share knowledge about a particular location, the more likely it is to score &mdash; but the less valuable it will be for you since you cannot use that knowledge for your diary!&#10;&#10;",

The Advanced Game rules cover situations specifically applicable to this unique campaign starting with an amphibious invasion, followed by sweeping cross-country movement ending in siege warfare.&#10;&#10;Thunder On the Mississippi provides excellent gaming value, with 11 Basic Game scenarios and one Advanced Game campaign, ranging from 1-turn learning scenarios to the full 70-turn campaign game.&#10;&#10;It contains:&#10;&#10;        GCACW Series Rules Booklet (24 pages, including illustrations, play examples, charts) &#10;        Thunder On the Mississippi Rules Booklet (about 56 pages, including scenarios, the Game as History, Gazetteer, etc.)&#10;        Two 22&quot;x 32&quot; full-color map sheets&#10;        Two 280-piece counter sheets and one 140-piece half counter sheet&#10;        One Terrain Effects Chart&#10;        Two full-color Force Displays &#10;        Two 4-page full-color Charts and Tables&#10;        Two 6-sided Dice&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher, adapted&#10;&#10;",

If you succeed, you get the reward (gold, life points...). If you fail, you can lose life points, gains, cards... and maybe you will not be alone. Every player can interact during the turn of the others, using Cheapshots or Magic stuff.&#10;&#10;When the draw pile is empty, one last turn is played. This is the final phase.

There are very few games on the topic, and none quite like this. The US Army, US Marine Corp, ROK Army, NKPA, and CPA forces are all represented. Air power, armor, and the Naval might of the UN forces are represented simply and elegantly. Rail movement, amphibious landings, and surprise attacks are in here too. Can you as the NKPA take Seoul and Pusan before the might of the US led UN forces get too strong? Will you as the UN player be able to blitz into N. Korea securing the Yalu River before Chinese forces come pouring across like a blizzard from the north? And as a last resort can you secure more enemy territory to control across the 38th Parallel as the peace makers negotiate the end of the war? The decisions are yours!&#10;&#10;",

While the northern group of armies (Army Group North) pushed towards Leningrad in a war of rapid maneuver its 16th Army covered the flank in the Lake Ilmen &ndash; Valday Hills area. Here, fighting began to settle down in early fall 1941 and by January had become static. Then the Soviets attacked. By late January the Soviet 11th Army had broken the German front in several sectors and threatened to surround perhaps 70,000 Germans around Demyansk. When 3rd Shock Army broke the southern wing of German 16th Army Soviet advances threatened now to destroy 16th Army and open the flank to Leningrad. It is at this stage that game-play begins.&#10;&#10;Demyansk Shield recreates the World War II campaign in the Valday Hills region of Russia, from late January 1942 through May 1942. One player will control the Axis forces (Germans), while his opponent controls the Soviet forces (Russians). The playing pieces represent the actual units that participated in the campaign and the map represents the terrain over which those units fought. The players maneuver their units across the map and conduct combat according to the rules of play. One player wins by capturing certain specified objectives while his opponent wins by avoiding those victory conditions.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 6 days&#10;Hex: 2 miles / 3.25 Km&#10;Units: Battalion to Brigades&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 22 x 34&quot; full color map&#10;Two dual-side printed countersheets (352 5/8&quot; counters)&#10;One 28-page Demyansk Shield rulebook&#10;Six single-side printed scenario set-up charts&#10;Two single-side printed player aide charts&#10;Six plastic zip storage bags&#10;One 6-sided dice&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: Medium-High&#10;Complexity Level: Medium&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 12+ hours&#10;&#10;",

The game depicts four battles in which the Italians were the protagonists: the two battles of Agordat against the Dervishes, Amba Alagi, and Coatit against the Ethiopians. A bonus scenario depicting the battle of Metemma between the Dervishes and the Ethiopian Emperor Johannes IV is also included.&#10;&#10;Here are the description of the Scenarios:&#10;S1 First Agordat:&#10;A raiding party of Dervishes are caught by the Ascari troops commanded by Captain Gustavo Fara in the plain of Agordat.&#10;&#10;S2 Agordat:&#10;2200 native Askari and some Italian national soldiers, led by Lt. Colonel Arimondi, encounters in the plain of Agordat around 12,000 Mahdists, led by the Amir of Ghedaref, attempting to invade the Italian Colony of Eritrea. An astonishing Italian victory and the very first one of the young nation.&#10;&#10;S3 Coatit:&#10;The Italian Army in Eritrea, led by General Baratieri, wins its last victory before Adowa, attacking the overhelming Ras Mangasha&rsquo;s Army at Coatit, fighting two days and performing a perfect redeployment under enemy fire. Tactically a draw, but stra-tegically a victory.&#10;&#10;S4 Amba Alagi&#10;The political quarrel between Gen. Arimondi and Eritrea Governor Baratieri led the IV Native Battalion to be put in the advanced position of Amba Alagi, just in front of the full Negus Menelik Ethiopian Army. Arimondi wanted to repeat Agordat, when with few troops managed to win the day, and therefore, despite Baratieri&rsquo;s order to withdraw the Battalion, he didn&rsquo;t forward it to Lt. Toselli, condemning him and his men to sure death&hellip; it will be the prelude to Adowa!&#10;&#10;S5 Metemma&#10;After the sack of the historic capital city of Gondar in 1888, Negus Neghesti Johannes IV gathered an army to repel the Mahdists from the city of Metemma. While on the way to victory, the Ethiopians melt away demoralized by the killing of their Emperor during the final assault.&#10;&#10;",

The regular Yahtzee rules listed below are used (except that there are thirty-nine categories instead of thirteen). The columns on the score sheet are divided into first, second and third with a multiplier added to each. For First column the scores are just added up, for second column the scores are doubled and for third column the scores are tripled so in effect throwing 4 - 6's in column one would be valued at 24 but those same 4 - 6's put in column three would be worth 72 points. Therefore it is important to put your very good scores in the third column.&#10;&#10;Yahtzee rules: A classic dice game played with 5 dice. Each player's turn consists of rolling the dice up to 3 times in hope of making 1 of 13 categories. Examples of categories are 3 of a kind, 4 of a kind, straight, full house, etc. Each player tries to fill in a score for each category, but this is not always possible. When all players have entered a score or a zero for all 13 categories, the game ends and total scores are compared.&#10;&#10;",

For 150 years, Tatar armies had readily destroyed all Russian opposition, and Kulikovo was the first sign that Russia was starting to emerge from Tatar domination. It would take several centuries more.&#10;&#10;Kulikovo is considered a major turning point/battle of the Middle Ages, in that it not only showed that a western-style, &quot;heavy&quot; army could defeat the Mongols, but it was also the first major step in the unification of the various Russian principalities under the leadership of Muscovy.&#10;&#10;Kulikovo is an accessible, fast-playing, fun wargame of low complexity.

    "description": "The Men Who Would Be Kings is a set of rules designed for fighting historical or Hollywood colonial battles in the mid- to late-Nineteenth Century, from the Indian Mutiny to the Boxer Rebellion. Large scale colonial clashes tended to be one-sided affairs, but there are countless reports of brief, frantic skirmishes in every colonial war--where either side could be victorious--and these are the battles that The Men Who Would Be Kings seeks to recreate. Although focusing on the British colonial wars against the Zulus, Maoris, and others, these rules will also permit players to explore the empires of France, Germany, and other nations, as well as allowing for battles between rival native factions. Gameplay is very simple, and is driven by the quality of the officers leading your units, in the true spirit of Victorian derring-do and adventure, where larger than life characters such as the (real) Fred Burnaby and the (fictional) Harry Flashman led their troops to glory and medals, or to a horrible end at the point of a spear tip.&#10;&#10;",
