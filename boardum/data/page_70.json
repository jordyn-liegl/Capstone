    "description": "This game was designed and then published as a contract order from a Swiss insurance company ASSURA SA. It is intended to promote one of their product, ANIMALIA, an insurance for pets and animals.&#10;&#10;One of the goals set early in the process was to design a &quot;real game&quot;, not a mere advertising product, playable with the whole family. That's how the game ended up being playable for 2 to 6 players, age 7 and up. It's a light card game, which is enjoyable among adults and children alike, the latter ones having a chance of winning thanks to the luck factor induced by card-drawing.&#10;&#10;&quot;You're determined to be awarded the title of Best Breeder and you have three season to win as many medals as you can with your show animals. But beware, your opponents are all trying to do the same thing and they certainly won't hesitate to use their animals' special powers to spoil your plans. Stay alert, keep an eye on your opponents' animals as well as your own - and see who gets to the top of the medal table!&quot;&#10;&#10;The players are animal-breeders who compete to present the finest collection of show-animals over the&#10;course of 3 seasons and each season is split into 3 phases.  In the first phase, players take turns drafting 5 animals into their collection.  In the second phase, players compare the elegance of their animals by counting the stars at the top of their cards.  Bonuses are awarded to the 2 players with the most elegant animal collections.  Medals are awarded in phase 3 at the end of each season.  Players earn animal medals for having multiple animals of the same family, or 5 different animals. The breeder with the highest number of medals at the end of the third season is declared the winner!&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "In the distant past, a starship from a faraway world appeared in the sky. Damaged in battle, the craft broke apart and traced lines of fire across the horizon. These falling stars crashed to the surface, and in the ages to come, became enshrined in legends as the Lost Legacy. Discover where the Lost Legacy can be found and win the game!&#10;&#10;Lost Legacy: Fourth Chronicle contains two sets of game cards: The Werewolf and Undying Heart. Each set can be played independently or mixed together with other sets to create a unique custom set. As for how to play, Lost Legacy is a game of risk, deduction, and luck for 2&ndash;4 players. You start the game with one card in hand from a deck of sixteen cards. On a turn, you do the following:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Draw: Draw the top card from the deck and add it to your hand.&#10;    Play: Choose one of the two cards in hand to play and place it face up in front of you.&#10;    Effect: Carry out the played card's effect, after which the card is considered as discarded.&#10;    End: If there is at least one card left in the deck, the turn goes to the next player; if not, the investigation phase starts. Using the investigation speed indicated on the card each player has in hand, players take turns guessing which player (whether yourself or someone else) holds the &quot;Lost Legacy&quot; card; this card might also be in the &quot;Ruins&quot;, a location that holds one card at the start of the game and possibly acquires more cards during play. The player who guesses correctly wins; if no one finds the Lost Legacy, then everybody loses.&#10;&#10;&#10;By combining different Lost Legacy sets (while keeping only a single Lost Legacy card in play), up to six players can compete at the same time.&#10;&#10;Note: Undying Heart was previously released as Lost Legacy: Undying Heart but AEG published it with a new title and with some card name changes.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "The hysteria over witches among the people of Salem swept the region like a disease in 1692. As is the case in any tragic event, there are those whom will use the circumstances to their advantage. Under the veil of the witch-hunt lie other motivations; power, greed, revenge and righteousness.&#10;&#10;AFFLICTION: Salem 1692 is a game set in the hysteria of a witch-hunt. Use your influence to whisper in the ear of the magistrate, judge, governor or minister to protect some and have others arrested. Salem was a chance to gain property, exact revenge and prove one&rsquo;s righteousness.&#10;&#10;The characters in the game were actual residents of the Salem region. This is the closest possible simulation of actual events in a game to date.&#10;&#10;GAMEPLAY: Players will take turns placing a &quot;messenger&quot; (worker) to select actions. After all workers are placed, actions will be resolved in the order they appear on the main board.&#10;&#10;EXONERATE - Take 2 Accusation Tokens off of any Colonist.&#10;FIRST PLAYER TOKEN/PROTECTION - Use a letter from the Governor to prevent one Colonist from being arrested and take the First turn, next turn.&#10;GAIN INFLUENCE/USE COLONIST ABILITY - Generate Influence and use the abilities of Colonists that you have in your Circle.&#10;ARREST - Spend Influence equal to a Colonist's adjusted Reputation to Arrest.&#10;SPECTRAL EVIDENCE - Use this token to prevent a Colonist from Generating Influence and using their Colonist ability.&#10;ACCUSE - Place accusation tokens to reduce Colonist's Reputations to make them easier to arrest.&#10;GAIN/REMOVE FEAR - Gain Fear Tokens or remove a fear token from another player (used to weaken Colonists)&#10;BRING COLONIST INTO CIRCLE - Spend Influence equal to a Colonists Base Reputation and bring them into your Circle.&#10;&#10;Play will cycle between accusing, arresting and protecting your interests. Fear provides an alternative way to function when necessary.&#10;&#10;END GAME: Increase Mather and Mary Spencer Hill are shuffled in with the bottom 6 cards of the Colonist deck. When either of them appears in the play area, the game immediately ends.&#10;&#10;VICTORY CONDITIONS: All players will receive victory points for the Reputation value of each Colonist that have arrested or brought into their circle, victory points for the property of those they have had arrested and for the number of influence tokens they have at the end of the game. Each player will also receive points for having specific families arrested or protected, depending on the player tile they are given.&#10;&#10;",

A pyramid scores more points when it's made from a few colors, but it's much harder to consistently outbid the other players for the necessary blocks.

In a flurry of no-holds-barred trading, only the craftiest players will survive. . . Break out WHEEDLE and rise to the top!&quot;&#10;&#10;This game is Reiner Knizia's take on Pit. It consists of simultaneous trading of various stocks, trying to get a majority.&#10;&#10;Gameplay: A card is placed facedown in the center, and the remainder of the deck is dealt out. When the central card is flipped over, players begin calling out what they're collecting or wanting to trade away: &quot;Anyone have N Securities?&quot; (or, more, likely, &quot;I've got yellow, who wants yellow?&quot;) You can trade with anyone, any number of cards, including unequal trades. You may also swap one of your cards with the central card. When a player obtains a majority of all the stock types they have in their hand (for example, 4 of the 7 green cards and 3 of the 5 blue cards), play stops and the round is scored.&#10;&#10;Scoring: The player who stops the play gets +5 (or -5 if they don't have a majority after all). You get +2 for each stock card if you have a monopoly of that stock, and +1 per card if you have a majority but not all of them. Warning: You get -1 for each card in your hand that matches whichever stock is the central (bankrupt) card when the round ends. You get 0 points for any card that is not part of either a majority or the bankrupt company. After each player has dealt once, the game is over and whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

To make these duels more challenging, an all new initiative system has been created using activation cards that might grant players a jump on their opponents, but limit their flexibility in the process. The cards can also be used as events that provide additional shipboard flavor. These new systems are fully compatible with the original Flying Colors game, with mechanics that can be selected a la carte.&#10;&#10;COMPONENTS&#10;&#10;    3 22&quot;x34&quot; full-color maps&#10;    2 Countersheets&#10;    2 Player Aid Cards&#10;    55 Initiative Cards&#10;    Rule Book&#10;    Play Book&#10;    1 10-sided die&#10;&#10;&#10;TIME SCALE: 5-10 minutes per turn&#10;MAP SCALE: 100 meters per hex&#10;UNIT SCALE: Individual Ships&#10;NUMBER OF PLAYERS: One to Four&#10;&#10;(from GMT website)&#10;&#10;",

Rumor has it, that in the dark and gloomy Netherworld, some friends become enemies...&#10;&#10;Now get up and hurry! The Heldentaufe already started. Be the first who returns the teeth of glory.&#10;&#10;The unique experience of Heldentaufe arises due to two distinct but connected realms: The Upper world and the Netherworld. Heroes can travel back and forth to the separate worlds through so-called &quot;portals&quot;.&#10;&#10;Events and activities taking place in the Upper world are mostly serene and peaceful. You will harvest natural goods, carry out missions and trade items that you find. Somewhere hidden in the Netherworld lies a bright and shiny treasure. But what underworld would be complete without monsters and traps?&#10;&#10;Players will change perspective frequently since they not only have to tell their hero which move to make next, but also command the monsters in the Netherworld, as soon as an opponent enters the dark realm. In a game with three or four players, forging an alliance to increase a player's odds in combat against monsters can be a smart choice. However, players should choose their swordmates wisely - once unearthed, the treasures of the Netherworld might lead even their most trusted allies to suddenly turn against them...&#10;&#10;Due to the two distinctly different worlds, both aggressive warmongers and pacifistic characters will embrace the gameplay of Heldentaufe.&#10;&#10;Heldentaufe is easy to learn and lets you experience all the key elements of a true adventure role-playing game (discovering treasures, collecting items, completing missions, and battling monsters).&#10;&#10;A game for tactical players who can count on their luck in critical situations.&#10;&#10;",

A variant propose to a fifth player to have the cops with the objective of sending every gang in prison. You can steal money in the street, deal drugs, vamp the characters of other players, buy/racket/rob shops or kill other characters, shopkeepers or cops. The killer has a bonus to kill, the femme fatale can vamp characters and the dealer is the only one who can deal (of course).&#10;&#10;Cops are played by the player whose turn it is (so cops move each turn of each player) except in the variant where they are played by a player. They can testify against or arrest gangsters but they can also be bought.&#10;&#10;Combats (duels) are resolved as follow and make one of the originality of the game. Each involved player rolls dice accordingly to the characters in duel (1D6, 1D6+2 for a killer, 2D6 for a cop) and sums them. The highest roller acts first and is the attacker.  A cardboard figure is set up for each participating character in the duel. The attacker shoots with the dart pistol towards the targets with as many darts as the difference between the totals rolled. If he shoots every opposing character, he wins. Then the defender shoots with the same number of darts. This exchange continues until one of the player has shot down all the targets of the other. A face down target mean the character has been killed. Face up means he's only wounded.&#10;&#10;If all 3 characters of a player are dead at the same time, he loses. He should recruit reinforcements before that happens, though.&#10;&#10;",

You have cards representing Night Terrors, and the more of them you combine in the right order, the more monsters will come to life, and the more horrifying they become. Create monsters that will make your opponents gasp in horror. Nourish them with your own fear and make them stronger. Only then will you achieve victory and become the Master of Terror!&#10;&#10;Each Night Terror is also associated with one of four Legions of Horror: Necromunculi, Constricti, Mansters, or Chimeridae. A Terror's legion is indicated by the color of the card's background: blue stands for Necromunculi, brown for Constricti, green for Chimeridae, and red for Mansters. A creature can be made up of any Night Terrors, but players are better off weaving Creatures out of cards that all belong to the same legion.&#10;&#10;The game continues until one of the players completes five Creatures&mdash;this player immediately becomes the winner.&#10;&#10;During your turn you perform two actions, after which the next person to your left takes their his? turn. You can select any pair of actions out of three possibilities (you can also perform the same action twice).&#10;&#10;Possible actions &#10;A) Take a card from the deck &#10;B) Discard as many cards as you like from your hand and take half that number from the deck&#10;C) Play a card from your hand and activate a Creature abilities (if the Creature is complete).&#10;&#10;As soon as you complete a Creature (by adding a head to torso), perform all of its abilities top to bottom, starting with the Creature's head, proceeding with its torso, and ending with its legs. Abilities are activated one at a time in a very specific order. You cannot refuse to perform the abilities.&#10;&#10;If the completed Creature is comprised of Night Terrors &#10;of the same legion (in other words, if all three cards that make up the Creature have the same background color), each of your opponents must discard one card of that legion from their hands before its abilities can be performed. If your opponent does not have an appropriate card, they must discard any two cards.&#10;Creature Abilities&#10;&#10;&bull; Herald: turn over two cards form the deck. Place them in front of you according to the usual rules if you can.   Discard any cards that you cannot play.&#10;&bull; Weeper: take any two cards from the deck.&#10;&bull; Mocker: play one card from your hand according to the usual rules.&#10;&bull; Executioner: add the top card from any other player's Creature to your hand.&#10;&bull; Scavenger: discard any vulnerable (incomplete) Creature.&#10;&bull; Devourer: discard the top card from any of your Creatures other than this one.&#10;&#10;",

On a turn, a player moves a die as many spaces in a straight line as the value showing on the die's face. A die can't move through another piece, but it can wrap around the side of the board and it can bounce off the front or back wall at an angle to move its full distance.&#10;&#10;If you land a die on an opponent's die, that second die is removed and the value of that die added to the lowest die on the opponent's team, keeping their pip count at 25. (If a die reaches 6, you add any remaining speed to what is now the lowest die.) If you land on one of your own dice, you bump that die one space in the same direction, possibly leading to another bump or a capture.&#10;&#10;Instead of moving, if you have two dice next to one another, you can spend the turn adjusting their values while keeping their sum the same. If, for example, you have a 2 and 5 adjacent to one another, you can change them to 1 &amp; 6, 3 &amp; 4, 4 &amp; 3, 5 &amp; 2, or 6 &amp; 1.&#10;&#10;The center of the board has a chamber on it. You cannot move a die through the chamber. If you land a die on the chamber, you split the value of that die on two dice as evenly as possible. (You start the game with one spare.) Those dice emerge from the chamber on spaces adjacent to it, possibly resulting in bumps or captures.&#10;&#10;If you knock an opponent down to only four dice, then they have a pip count below 25 and they lose the game.&#10;&#10;",

Only those who know how to please the Emperor, cleverly exert their influence, and invest at the right time will succeed in City of Rome.&#10;&#10;In more detail, the game lasts fourteen rounds, and in each round, players draft one of the building cards in play and add it to their hand. The drafting order depends on how closely you stand to the emperor. At the start of a round, you reveal a new &quot;action strip&quot; that has three bricks and two cogs in some order, then players take turns placing their figure on one of these five spaces; the closer you are to the emperor, the earlier you draft, but the fewer resources (bricks and cogs) you receive. (With only two players in the game, each player places two figures on the action strip and takes two complete turns each round.)&#10;&#10;After drafting, you can take one build action and one produce action. To build, you must pay the cost in bricks &mdash; paying two coins for each missing brick &mdash; then place the card you're building adjacent to another card of yours already in play. You start with two building cards in play, so you'll have at most sixteen cards at game's end. These cards must fit in a 4x4 square, so plan carefully since you'll want to place some buildings next to other ones to earn the most points and to get the most out of a produce action. Some buildings give you a special action or influence tokens when you build them.&#10;&#10;To produce, you must have two cogs &mdash; paying one coin for each missing cog &mdash; then use the production action of each building in your city once.&#10;&#10;Every few rounds, an influence card is revealed, and whoever has the most influence tokens at the end of that round collects the card, then discards their tokens.&#10;&#10;At the end of fourteen rounds, players score points for their residential buildings, temples, aqueducts, coins, and influence cards and tokens. whoever has the most points wins!&#10;&#10;",

They shop for specific colors, often ranging into neighboring hues to achieve a nuanced, scrappy look. Quilters love a sale, where they may buy fabric just to have it on hand. If they can't find the colors they want, they sometimes hand dye their own fabric. They use their time and skills converting fabric into blocks, which they combine to make quilts. Often, quilters work on more than one quilt at a time to keep things interesting. They may embellish their quilts with intricate quilting stitches. The best quilters make good color choices, combine blocks skillfully, use their time well, and win generous purchase awards when they enter their quilts in shows.&#10;&#10;In Quilt Show, &quot;quilters&quot; collect fabric cards, which can be exchanged for block tiles. The quilters race the clock as they amass block tiles that they can combine into one or more quilts at a time. They can mix block tiles of a single color or a single pattern to make a quilt. Three times during the game, when the clock reveals it is time for a quilt show, quilts are entered and prize money is awarded. At game's end, the quilter with the most prize money wins!&#10;&#10;",

Tribes: Early Civilization is a game for 2-4 players (The game does include rules for solo play as well) experiencing the Paleolithic, Neolithic and Bronze ages in 40 minutes. Players start with a small tribe and the very basics of civilization. During the game, they invent new technologies, explore new land, fend off invaders, and survive catastrophes. The tribe that first emerges as a true civilization wins!&#10;&#10;Tribes: Early Civilization is a thematic prequel to Nations, designed by one of the Nations designers. It is a fast 3X game with a twist as each player has their own separate area to explore, expand, and exploit. The other two areas of the game are highly interactive:&#10;&#10;&#10;     The variable three-tiered technology tree in which the first inventor gets a bonus.&#10;     The actions column in which you take an action every turn and unwanted actions accumulate shells in a closed system.&#10;&#10;&#10;There are three basic actions tied to your civilization levels: explore, move and grow. The actions column is also where historical events come into play and where the fourth civilization level &mdash; strength &mdash; is used to gain you bonuses and make bad things happen to your opponents.&#10;&#10;Several interlocking systems ensure high replayability without adding overhead or upkeep. For example: in one game shells can feel very scarce and the next abundant despite the exact same amounts being in play.&#10;&#10;",

That envelope is placed in the center of the gameboard. The rest of the deck is shuffled and distributed to the players as evenly as possible. Each player now assumes the role of one of the suspects. The object of the game is to deduce which are the missing cards. In turn, the players will roll the dice and move their pawns to various rooms. Once in a room, the player may float a rumor as to which are the missing cards. If the person to the rumormonger&rsquo;s immediate left can disprove the rumor by showing one of the cards mentioned, then the player must secretly reveal the card. Play continues until one person can identify the missing cards correctly, that person is the winner.&#10;&#10;The version&rsquo;s additions:&#10;Each person has been given a unique power which may be used only once per game. There is an Intrigue deck which may or may not grant a player an extra action. Those Intrigue cards which do not grant an extra action are called Clock Cards. The player who draws the eighth Clock card is eliminated from play. Any player who draws a Clock Card thereafter is also eliminated. The &ldquo;one&rdquo; on one of the dice has been replaced by &ldquo;?&rdquo;. Any player who rolls &ldquo;?&rdquo; must draw an Intrigue card.&#10;&#10;",

No game tells the story of World War II in Asia and the Pacific like Dai Senso!&#10;&#10;Dai Senso! takes the playable, unpredictable and enjoyable Krieg! system used for World War II in Europe and adapts it to tell the story of Japan&rsquo;s struggle from a unique perspective. Most other Pacific wargames focus on the operational aspects of the 1941-45 war. DS starts in 1937 for a true strategic experience from the beginning of World War II in Asia. As the leader of Imperial Japan seeking complete domination (&quot;hakko ichiu&quot;), will you strike at China, Russia, the British Empire or the United States? Whichever way you choose, you must eventually face the grim struggle of total war. All of these options are literally in the cards that form the strategies of the three factions -- Axis, Soviet Allies and Western Allies.&#10;&#10;Best of all, Dai Senso! can be linked with its new European companion game, Axis Empires: Totaler Krieg!, to play the joint Axis Empires scenario, an eye-opening global look at all of World War II. The fate of the world is in your hands!&#10;&#10;Dai Senso! means Total War in Japanese. In the game, play moves from Pre-War (where players mobilize their forces and engage in diplomacy) to Limited War (when open conflict begins) to Total War -- at that point, it&rsquo;s all-out warfare to achieve victory!&#10;&#10;",

Players then play a trick-taking game, and whoever wins a trick must place the cards sorted by domain (color) in front of themselves; if they receive multiple cards of a color in the same trick, the lowest-valued card must be placed on top. The tricks continue until either all cards have been played or one player collects cards in all five colors. In this latter case, that player receives negative points for what they've collected while everyone else scores positively for their topmost card in each color. (If all the cards have been played, then all players score.) Whoever has the most points after five complete rounds wins!&#10;&#10;In addition to the regular cards, Druids contains special cards that allow a player to avoid an unwanted trick or remove cards of one color from a player's holdings.&#10;&#10;",

You may try to make the highest scoring word possible, but&hellip; you&rsquo;ll have to test the strength of the word against a roll of the 20-sided die. Roll equal to or higher than the value of your word and you&rsquo;re safe&hellip; but roll less than the value of your word and you lose a precious piece of your sanity, represented by an adorable Cthulhu pawn!&#10;&#10;Each letter is uniquely illustrated with a horrifying character from the works of H.P. Lovecraft, which adds to the dark whimsy of the game.&#10;&#10;Since its release in 2007, Unspeakable Words has been received with great reviews. It was Games Magazine's Word Game of the Year and the Best Party Board Game at BoardGameGeek's Golden Geek Awards.  In 2008, a second edition of Unspeakable Words was released, this time with purple pawns. Because of the flexibility of the game, a second deck and second set of pawns can be added for twice as many players.&#10;&#10;Since the inception of Unspeakable Words, Playroom Entertainment has wanted to release more specialized editions. With this Kickstarter, supporters can upgrade the Unspeakable Words game with special multi-colored pawns (five pawns each of eight colors to play up to eight players!), a dice/pawn bag and additional cards!

In each mini-game, each player draws and plays a six-card line-up drawn from their 15-card roster of active players. At the end of each mini-game, a winner is determined, and new players are bought. A team must always be 15 players, so for each new player bought, one of the existing players is sent down to the Minor Leagues.&#10;&#10;The player who wins the most mini-games in the series is the overall winner.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "In ancient Rome, tribunes were highly esteemed individuals elected by the people to represent them politically and militarily. In Tribune, players take on the role of a powerful and ambitious patrician family. By applying influence and manipulating controls over the various factions, they attempt to pave their way to victory in order to attain the high office of the tribune.&#10;&#10;In more detail, Tribune is a combination of worker placement and set collection. Each round, players take turns positioning their followers on the board to collect cards, achieve objectives, and attempt to take over factions. To gain control of a faction and use its benefits, you must play a set of at least two cards from that specific group. You remain in command of that faction until an opponent plays another set of this faction that either contains more cards or has a higher sum of values.&#10;&#10;As soon as a player meets the required number of objectives on the victory condition card selected at the start of the game (with that card being dependent on the number of players), that player wins the game. Alternatively, you can forgo the use of a condition card and play with a point-value option; in this variant, the game ends when a player has collected a certain number of faction markers, and whoever has the most points at this time &mdash; based on the completion of various achievements &mdash; wins.&#10;&#10;This edition of Tribune includes the Tribune: Primus Inter Pares base game and Tribune Expansion while featuring new mechanisms and elements from designer Karl-Heinz Schmiel.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Sugar Gliders is a board game for two to four players. Each game lasts around 20 minutes. Each player has a sugar glider, that has to collect as many fruits as possible by jumping from branch to branch.&#10;&#10;The sugar glider is a small marsupial that loves nectarous foods. As its name suggests, it&rsquo;s capable of gliding through the air, much like a flying squirrel.&#10;&#10;COMPONENTS&#10;&#10;- A board depicting a tree with 61 cells.&#10;- 4 sugar gliders in different colours.&#10;- 60 food tiles in 5 types: 1 fruit, 2 fruits, 3 fruits, 4 fruits, 1 big fruit (5 points).&#10;- A carrying case.&#10;&#10;GAME PREPARATION&#10;&#10;Each player chooses a player color and takes the corresponding sugar glider.&#10;&#10;Leaving the center space empty, randomly distribute the 60 tiles face-up to the 60 other spaces on the tree, 1 per space.&#10;&#10;White starts by choosing any space with a white fruit (value 1 tile), and placing his sugar glider on it. The tile in that space will be his &lsquo;jumping tile&rsquo;. In turn, the other players do the same.&#10;    &#10;The game can start now. White plays first.&#10;&#10;GAME RULES&#10;&#10;The game is played in turns, counterclockwise. On your turn, you must either make your sugar glider jump or go into a brief state of torpor:&#10;&#10;JUMP&#10;&#10;Move your sugar glider in a straight line a number of spaces equal to your &lsquo;jumping tile&rsquo; (this means one space in the first turn). If you have no &lsquo;jumping tile&rsquo; underneath your sugar glider, you must use one from your reserve. Notice that purple fruits count as 5 movement points.&#10;&#10;Then you take the &lsquo;jumping tile&rsquo; that you just used, and put it beside yourself face-up. This is your &lsquo;reserve&rsquo;. If you had no &lsquo;jumping tile&rsquo; underneath your sugar glider and had to use a tile from your reserve, discard this tile to the game case; it cannot be used again for the rest of the game.&#10;&#10;The tile on which your sugar glider has landed (if any) is your new &lsquo;jumping tile&rsquo;.&#10;&#10;Exceptions:&#10;&#10;- The sugar gliders cannot jump outside the tree.&#10;- A sugar glider sitting in the center space can jump to any space on the board by spending any tile from his reserve (no need to match the length of the jump).&#10;- A sugar glider cannot move through another sugar glider.&#10;&#10;Example: Anna wishes to make her sugar glider jump, but there is no &lsquo;jumping tile&rsquo; underneath her sugar glider. She uses a &lsquo;2&rsquo; from her reserve, moves the sugar glider 2 spaces in a straight line, and discards the tile she&rsquo;s used to the case.&#10;&#10;TORPOR&#10;&#10;You don&rsquo;t move your sugar glider. Take the &lsquo;jumping tile&rsquo; from underneath your sugar glider (if there is one), and add it to your reserve.&#10;&#10;GAME END&#10;&#10;The game ends when all the sugar gliders are consecutively in a state of torpor, or when the tree runs out of tiles, whichever happens first.&#10;&#10;Each player sums the values of the tiles in his reserve (purple tiles count as 5 points). Highest score wins. In case of a tie, play again.&#10;&#10;VARIANT FOR 2 PLAYERS&#10;&#10;For shorter 2-player games, discard all the purple fruit tiles and 3 tiles of each other value. Then play on the inner board.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Every morning in Mumbai, over five thousand workers dressed in white swarm out to deliver more than 200,000 &quot;dabbas&quot; (multistoried lunch boxes) to the offices of the Indian metropolis. These &quot;Dabba Walla&quot; have been an iconic fixture in the cityscape since 1890. The food is freshly prepared at home by families, then collected from their front doors by the Dabba Walla. Even though some of the dabbas travel very far, they are delivered punctually via a network of intermediate stations with an amazing reliability of 99.999%! Now it's time to join the Dabba Walla on their daily journey through Mumbai...&#10;&#10;The game Dabba Walla consists of two phases:&#10;&#10;&bull; Pick-up phase: Take turns moving your Dabba Walla through Mumbai to collect dabba cards. Each time you pick up a card, you then play one of the three in your hand to take the depicted dabba tile &mdash; a polyomino of 1-4 squares &mdash; and place it in your cart, stacking tiles higher and higher as the rounds progress. Dabbas come in four colors, and you must place them on flat surfaces, filling holes with empty dabbas if needed. If you connect two half-chai symbols on tiles on the same level, you draw a random chai tile with a bonus action. Keep all played dabba cards in a personal discard pile.&#10;&#10;&bull; Delivery phase: After everyone has placed fifteen tiles in their cart, it's time to deliver lunches! Pick up all the cards you played, then complete a number of delivery rounds equal to the highest level that someone has stacked their dabbas. Each round, each player plays and reveals one dabba card from their hand, optionally playing chai tiles as well. Sum the value of each color of dabba, then everyone scores their dabbas on the current level based on these values, removing the tiles from their carts. (Note: If not all players have dabbas on the current level being scored, they still play a card, but they score nothing.)&#10;&#10;Once all the dabbas have been delivered, players score for their remaining chai tiles, then whoever has collected the most tips wins.&#10;&#10;Dabba Walla contains two expansion modules to provide additional ways to score or change the value of dabbas being delivered.&#10;&#10;",

In order to win the game, you will have to face and overcome all the other pirates also searching the Golden Pineapple map.

Each of those Adventures is a new rule that will change the gameplay. There are 40 different tiles with a lot of different rules. Use them as their best to play more cards than you should or prevent the other players to play theirs!&#10;&#10;At the end of each round, the winner chooses a new Adventure and adds it to the previous ones.

Scientists theorize that, due to extremely poor vision but an excellent sense of smell, wombats use their poop cubes as &ldquo;smell markers&rdquo; to help them navigate their environment. Because their poop is cube-shaped it is less likely to roll away or be moved.&#10;&#10;You play as the mama wombat of your tribe. The dastardly dingo has stormed your burrow and chased away 4 of your baby wombats! You will need to eat and digest food in order to produce poop cubes, with which you will build smell areas so you can navigate your environment, find your baby wombats, and bring them home. The player who best plans their smell areas and moves most efficiently will prove victorious!&#10;&#10;The object of Wombat Rescue is to be the first player to find all 4 of your baby wombats and bring them home.&#10;&#10;",

Their discoveries will astonish the scientific community &mdash; but only if they run the expedition successfully. Whoever manages to collect the most relevant discoveries will be remembered throughout history.&#10;&#10;In more detail, players have to manage their scientists and assign them to several tasks, from cultivating good relationships with the natives in order to get their help for the expedition to making sure that everyone gets fed at the end of the day! But most importantly, they work to gather the most amazing collection of new discoveries though secret bidding to amaze the world at large.&#10;&#10;Players roll dice and allocate the results to the different areas of the board &mdash; huts, logistics, expeditions, funding, hunting and fishing, and field notebook &mdash; assigning their scientists to different tasks. Usually majorities determine which player wins each of these areas, which are where players can gather money to fund their expeditions, collect food to feed the crew, discover new scoring opportunities, or recruit more scientists. But the most important area is the expeditions zone, in which players can secretly bid for the discovery of new species of plants, animals or even native tribes. End of game scoring is based on the sets collected from the discovery zone, and the player with the highest prestige based on these sets wins the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;AWARDS&#10;&#10;- 2018 5 Seasons Best Portuguese Strategy Game Nominee&#10;- The Dice Tower - Seal of Approval&#10;- Jugamos Todos - JT@ 2019 Nominee&#10;- Imagination Gaming - Family &amp; Education Awards - Seal of Approval 2020&#10;&#10;",

Who will outsmart their opponents, spot the most birds, and be the best birder?&#10;&#10;In Birds of a Feather: Western North America, you and the other players explore different habitats to spot birds. In the first round, each player chooses and reveals a card from hand, then marks off on their score sheet or the app the bird they played as well as all other birds played in the same habitat. The deck contains cards from five habitats, with some birds being more common than others. In the second round, you each play a card again, then you mark all birds in your current habitat as well as all cards played the previous round in that habitat. Apparently word spread about all the great finds! Remove all cards from the first round, then keep playing additional rounds in the same manner.&#10;&#10;When each player has only one card left in hand, the game ends. For each ace bird you've seen in a habitat, you score 2 points; for each other non-common bird you've seen, score 1 point; and if you've seen all seven types of birds in a habitat, score 3 bonus points for a total of 10 points in that habitat. Whoever has the most total points wins.&#10;&#10;Birds of a Feather: Western North America differs from Birds of Feather thanks to new graphic design and improved rules for two- and three-player games to make them more strategic.&#10;&#10;",

During scoring actions and at the end of the game, players score points per skyscraper depending on the number of different types of businesses that are adjacent.&#10;     &#10;During their turn, players make take one of four actions: take 3 skyscrapers into their supply, place a business on an open lot, take a black bidding card and move a commissioner, or score a district. Depending on which action they take, they can then draw colored or black bidding cards.  Finally, at the end of their turn, all players must move a commissioner.  The commissioner&rsquo;s path is tracked, and once they have moved across the map, bidding immediately occurs in the districts the commissioner landed on in that trip.  Players use the bidding cards to bid on a specific lot, and must only use cards of the same color as the lot.  Black cards may be added in to any bid.  The winner can then build their skyscrapers on that lot or declare a building stop.  The player that declares the building stop scores a point for every skyscraper in the district.  Then, the district scores as normal, but the points received are halved.  Nothing further may be built there for the remainder of the game.&#10; The game ends when either there are no more businesses in the supply, or two building stops have been declared.  A final scoring round occurs for each district without a building stop.  The player with the most victory points is the winner.&#10;&#10;This game is #9 in the Alea big box series.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Sometimes even the familiar can be alien. As a ROVE (Results-Oriented Versatile Explorer) you are accustomed to the rigors of space, but the impenetrable darkness of the ocean depths is a brand-new challenge to confront.&#10;&#10;Aqua ROVE is a standalone entry in the ROVE series. In this solo spatial puzzler, the player must complete missions by using their movement cards to align ROVE&rsquo;s modules in the proper pattern. Each module has a unique one-time ability that can give ROVE a much-needed boost at a key moment. As ROVE travels further, efficient use of movement points and module abilities becomes paramount to achieve success.&#10;&#10;Experienced ROVE players will notice that there are a few changes in Aqua ROVE. For one, movement cards no longer provide generic points that are limited by the modules&rsquo; movement restrictions. Instead, each card provides both the points and the direction of movement, providing a major twist to the original gameplay. All modules have been replaced with new abilities to match this change. However, each pattern now requires two specific fixed modules to complete rather than one. And as befits an ocean adventure, ROVE&rsquo;s missions are now placed vertically rather than horizontally to create a beautiful panorama of your descent.&#10;&#10;",

When you move a piece, you move it a distance based on the strength indicated in the trough that you're leaving. Once the piece has made its way across the board, you move it back based on the strength on the other side. If you pass over an opposing piece while moving, then that opposing piece must return to its last departing base and your moving piece advances one cell further than where the opposing piece was.&#10;&#10;Although it is easy to reach a situation where moving any piece implies putting it at risk &mdash; therefore making you not want to move &mdash; it is important to note that having some of your pieces taken and making your opponent advance is often beneficial to you, since it reduces the amount of possible moves your opponent can perform and gives you extra moves. So do not be afraid or reluctant to place some of your pieces in front of your opponent's, because it can be good for you.&#10;&#10;Sit next to your rival and have fun!&#10;&#10;",

You share two random battlefields with each of the players next to you: one worth 4 points, the other 6.&#10;&#10;You get a hand of thirteen cards numbered from 0 to 3. They are your peasants, thugs, lords. On your turn, send two of them to one or two of your battlefields. When all the cards have been played, each battlefield is won by the player with the highest sum of card values there. Some cards are always played face up, others always face down. Some of them also have a special power: Use your peasants (0) to lure your opponent's troops to a battlefield, or to score more points if they survive. Play a Lord (2) early as it's strengthened by each new reinforcement thereafter.&#10;&#10;Terrains also impact a battle's outcome: Peasants take arms to protect their rice fields, while military strength is not always enough when you fight over a palace. Once each battlefield has been scored, the player with the most victory points wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "At the end of the 17th century, a French Benedictine monk in charge of the cellar at Hautvillers Abbey made an important contribution to differentiate wines from that region. As a result, it became possible to produce wines of superior quality, particularly in white wines made from black grape varieties. While Dom Pierre P&eacute;rignon initially felt the sparkling of the wine was a negative feature, the consequent increase in both quality and quantity created the path that lead to the appreciation and recognition of champagne.&#10;&#10;Throughout the 18th century, several &quot;champagne houses&quot; &mdash; or Champagne Maisons &mdash; were founded, and a new business dynamic grew in the region. These houses replaced small farm and monastery production in leading the evolutionary process of champagne, and by planting more vineyards or buying grapes from other producers or both, they mastered the specialization. To promote their product, the houses hired sales agents to take samples of their champagne wines to the Royal Courts of Europe, a crucial factor in generating the glamorous fashion of drinking champagne.&#10;&#10;Despite production growth, improved quality, and increasing popularity, trade did not reach spectacular rates during the 19th century &mdash; which is why the game Dom Pierre is much more about winning prestige than earning money. In the game, you are responsible for one of the oldest Champagne Maisons, producing and selling wine all over Europe, not to mention the other side of the Atlantic. The local economy will be boosted, employment increased, and your brand will become universally recognized.&#10;&#10;To make all this happen will require a chain of actions that starts in your vineyard. You will need to look for continuous improvement, constantly react to your opponents, and optimize your choices to build the most prestigious Champagne Maison. In game terms, on a turn you move up a disc on the winery game board and perform an action, with the actions become more powerful as the game progresses. You will plant in the vineyards, harvest crops, buy grapes from neighbors, make wines in your cellar (some more valuable than others), allocate salespeople on four market routes and workers in the vineyard and cellar, and acquire the necessary accessories to improve production.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "For endless years in a secluded region deep in the heart of a vast continent, four mysterious people have been developing different cultures, merging magic and technology in a delicate balance with nature and among themselves. Now, they must face a challenge: the arrival of new settlers, bringing with them more advanced crafts and technologies, new weapons and fighting techniques, and an entirely different lifestyle.&#10;&#10;As the leader of one of the original inhabitants of Altay, how will you react to this challenge? Will you be open to accepting the new settlers and merging with them, or will you focus on your ancient traditions? Will you expand your kingdom or develop new knowledge? Will you build monuments to last forever, or crush your enemies with your armies?&#10;&#10;Altay: Dawn of Civilization is an original blend of deck-building, civilization development, and area expansion. Players control one of four factions, each represented by a starting deck with unique cards and with subtle differences in the number of &quot;basic&quot; cards. Each turn, players use their cards to produce resources (stone, metal, wood, knowledge), build new settlements and expand on the board, attack or defend against their enemies, or manipulate their decks or card hand.&#10;&#10;The game board represents one of the regions where the four people are in conflict with one another, with each area characterized by a different terrain type and the presence of different resources. Card-playing and board expansions are fully integrated, as many cards will have greater effects if you control the right territories. Using the resources produced by their cards or collected from the board, players can acquire and add to their deck new cards, representing the new settlers and their crafts.&#10;&#10;Players can also spend resources to develop &quot;achievements&quot; &mdash; special cards that are permanently added to a faction, granting it additional capabilities or providing points.&#10;&#10;Victory is granted by the combination of territorial expansion, technological development, and the success in creating long-lasting memories of your civilization's achievements.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

There is a Sword cycle and a Magic cycle. Each cycle has slightly different rules. The length of a cycle varies. During a cycle the players take turns alternately &ndash; until the end of the cycle when one of the players will receive a victory point.&#10;At the end of a cycle you check whether one of the players has won.

    "description": "The Jaws of Victory: Battle of Korsun-Cherkassy Pocket: January/February 1944 is a historical simulation of the Soviet's winter offensive in the Ukraine in the early months of 1944 that trapped the better part of two German corps with a classic pincer movement by two Soviet Armies - and the German Army's desperate response to relieve their beleaguered comrades in the pocket.&#10;&#10;Following the defeat of the German Kursk Offensive in July of 1943, the Soviets unleashed a series of major offensives to clear the Ukraine of the German Army.  By mid-January of 1944, the Red Army had liberated the area north and east of the Dnepr and seized Kiev. Further south, they crossed the Dnepr bend, capturing Kirovograd and continued deep into the western Ukraine.  The Germans, however, maintained a hold on the Dnepr near Korsun in an exposed salient 70 miles southwest of Kiev.  Hitler insisted on holding the salient and refused requests from his generals to withdraw to more defensible positions.  This exposed salient was too tempting a target for the Soviets and in January, 1944 Stavka ordered the 1st &amp; 2nd Ukrainian Fronts to conduct a major operation; striking against the base of the salient to surround and eliminate two German Corps within.  The 2nd Ukrainian Front would breakthrough in the east on the 25th and race westward while the 1st Ukrainian Front would attack toward the east a day later; sealing the pocket at Zvenigorodka.  The Soviet offensive was a stunning success, slamming the gate on 60,000 men from six German divisions, including the 5th SS Panzer Division Wiking.  But, the Germans were not about to let the Korsun pocket become another &quot;Stalingrad&quot;.  Within a week they struck back with eight panzer divisions in a two-pronged counter-stroke of their own; this time to deal the Red Army an unexpected defeat from the Jaws of Victory.&#10;&#10;Seven separate scenarios covering the period from January 26 to February 18, including a 25-turn campaign game, allow both sides plenty of opportunities for offensive and defensive action.&#10;&#10;As the Soviet player, you begin with a two-pronged offensive, striking hard at the base of the German salient in an attempt to trap as many German units as possible.  If you succeed, you must then turn your attention southward to build the &quot;outer ring&quot; in preparation for the German counter-offensive, while systematically chewing away at the supply-starved defenders in the pocket.&#10;&#10;As the German player, you must slow the Soviet drives from both east and west by fighting a two-front defense, and if possible bring them to a halt.  Once the pocket forms, you must skillfully hang on and preserve as many of the trapped units as possible, and wait for you Panzer Divisions from the south to carve open an escape route.&#10;&#10;And both sides will have to contend with overstretched supply line, bad weather, and tank-stopping mud.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 1 day&#10;Hex: 2 miles / 3.2 kilometers&#10;Units: Battalion to Divisions&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;&#10;    Two 22 x 34&quot; full color mapsheets&#10;    Five dual-side printed countersheet (1,170 1/2&quot; counters - 4 full size &amp; 1 half countersheets)&#10;    One 32-page Jaws of Victory Rule Book&#10;    One 28-page Jaws of Victory Play Book&#10;    One single-side printed Game-Turn Record Track&#10;    One dual-side printed Sequence of Play Chart&#10;    One single-side printed Combat Phase Sequence Player Aide Card&#10;    One single-side printed German Player Aide Card&#10;    One single-side printed Soviet Player Aide Card&#10;    One single-side printed Terrain Effects Chart&#10;    One single-side printed Combat Results Table&#10;    Eight Dual-Side printed Scenario Cards (4 German &amp; 4 Soviet)&#10;    One dual-side printed Combat Manuals/Credits/Historical wrapper&#10;    One single-side printed Game Errata card&#10;    Two 6-sided dice&#10;&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: High&#10;Complexity Level: Moderate-High&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 6-50 hours&#10;&#10;",

You have to quickly study your dreams and push back the nightmares creeping in. Will you be fast enough to preserve the serenity of your nights?&#10;&#10;In Dream Runners, players are presented with a common dream tile each turn. Using their individual segmented tiles, they&rsquo;ll have to create a pattern where action symbols match the position of trials of the dream: banishing the nightmares away, collecting coins to purchase new segments, keys to open chests and star fragments to earn more victory points. In return, every trial that is not covered with a symbol will diminish your serenity, decreasing your final score.&#10;&#10;But as soon as one player completes their pattern, the hourglass is turned upside-down and all other players must finish their own patterns before time runs out! And suddenly, the quiet study of the dream becomes a frantic race to assemble segments...&#10;&#10;After eight rounds, the player with the most victory points wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

Kids won't know it, but while they're playing, they're learning the fundamentals of programming.&#10;&#10;Every player (&quot;Turtle Master&quot;) takes a turtle and a matching deck of cards. Stack the cards face up on the table in piles, then build a maze for each player out of walls and a jewel. The youngest turtle master goes first, placing his first card down, then moving (or having his parent move) the turtle accordingly. As players progress, they build their program on the table; if they make a mistake, they can shout &quot;Undo!&quot; and debug it.&#10;&#10;Before too long, kids figure out the secret of Robot Turtles: It lets the kids control the grown-ups! The little programmers put instruction cards down, driving the turtles through the maze, but the grown-up is the computer, executing commands on the board. At its heart, Robot Turtles is a game about bossing around adults, just like programming is about bossing around computers.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "In the golden age of Islam, many Scholars arise and amaze all in the land with their inventions and discoveries. Meanwhile The Kingdom who has just discovered the power of knowledge, starts to intrigue these Scholars in order to strengthen the monarchy and profit more from ruling the land. But The People who notice the intentions of the Sultan and his subjects, confront The Kingdom and struggle to help these Scholars. In the midst of the dispute between The People and The Kingdom, a sect called The Hashashin (The Assassins) has risen. They believe that power is the root of all corruption and must be destroyed. Therefore, The Hashashin are lead to killing these Scholars.&#10;&#10;Belaad: The Land of Swords and Quills is an engine-building thematic card game for 2 to 6 players. Players are split up in three teams and over the course of the game, attempt to triumph over the other two. The Hashashin come in play if there are an odd number of players in which a single player controls the team. Every team consists of a unique set of characters with special abilities and is as follows;&#10;&#10;     The Kingdom: Sultan, Vizier, Treasurer, Sheriff, Commander.&#10;     The People: Bahlool, Preacher, The Trustworthy, Altruist, Folk Hero.&#10;     The Hashashin: Sect Leader, Hashash, Spy, Assassin.&#10;&#10;&#10;The Kingdom and The People follow the same goal of hiring the most Scholars while The Hashashin mean to kill them. Every Scholar provides a number of scientific symbols for teams which count as victory points at the game's end.&#10;&#10;The game proceed by playing action cards. Each player has four cards in hand and plays a card by turn, using the action on the card, and after that draws another card from one of the three decks. Action cards help each player strengthen their team's characters, gain coins or steal coins from other teams, declare war and hire Scholars. Every character has a certain symbol, other than their special abilities, and can be strengthened by placing tokens on said character's mat. For example, the Treasurer provides more coins, the Commander becomes more powerful in war, the Sultan gains more influence in hiring Scholars and etc.&#10;&#10;Victory points are gained by two means; scientific points provided by Scholars, and military points gained from war. The game is played in 4 eras in which different Scholars emerge and at the end of the 4th era, the team with most victory points prevails.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The Fall of Germany begins at the eve of the great amphibious invasion of France and expands the war into the West. The War for Europe completes the picture with an examination of the entire 6 years of war in all of its ramifications. Great fleets of bombers may be launched towards enemy targets; swift Axis raiders joined by their deadly brethren, the U-Boat, can attempt to break the British supply line with America; mighty armadas may sail to challenge, in combat, for control of the seas, and much more.&#10;&#10;But Hitler's War does not limit one to just the kind of tactical or strategic decisions normally expected from a wargame. The great choices that faced each government must also be solved. Questions relating to war direction, production priorities, and research allotments become as important to ultimate victory as when to invade Russia or how much force will be needed to overrun France. Should the Allies attempt victory through airpower ? How much should the Axis invest in large mechanized armies versus the construction of U-boats ?
