I&rsquo;ll say it again. Meeple Microbes (squeeee!)&#10;&#10;In this nasty little 2-5 player game, your boss, Dr. Lillian Johannae has made a groundbreaking discovery in the field of microbiology. She has discovered a new breed of extremely unstable, highly volatile microorganisms, BIOTIX&trade; (patent pending and pronounced &lsquo;biotics&rsquo;) that can uneasily coexist within a small system. Now she needs supporting data. But science can be a brutally competitive field.  What began as an innocent pursuit of discovery has quickly devolved into self-centered posturing and ruthless backstabbing among her lab personnel, all vying to have their name attached to the research paper, thereby rocketing them you into scientific superstardom.&#10;&#10;Your mission, carefully grow the largest culture of BIOTIX you can in your petri dish &ndash; and sabotage the work of others by pushing their microbe populations above their limit, causing them to explode and bio-react in all sorts of fun ways.  Game play is simple: on your turn, draw two BIOTIX from the specimen bag and place them, one at a time, either into your own dish for points or into an opponent&rsquo;s dish to try and force a bio-reaction to destroy their work.&#10;&#10;Each of the five BIOTIX species has a different trigger number and a unique bio-reaction when they &lsquo;go off&rsquo;. It may force you to trash the microbes, force microbes from your dish into the petri dishes of others, steal microbes or wipe out a species across the whole table. The BIOTIX are in a constant state of flux throughout the game, as is your score, because at the end of the day you gain points for the BIOTIX remaining in your dish, with the most volatile BIOTIX being worth the most points.&#10;&#10;The best score over 3 days of research determines the winner! Then try the advanced game, with Aggressive BIOTIX, a cancer-like organism that mimics the properties of the BIOTIX they replace in your dish &ndash; except they are worth negative points instead of their usual values.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "In May 1942, the Japanese sought to capture Port Moresby on the south coast of New Guinea and interrupt communications between the United States and Australia. Such a move, they hoped, would bring the Americans to battle.&#10;&#10;The United States Navy needed no special inducement to fight its nation's enemies. Two American aircraft carriers met one small and two large Japanese carriers in the world's first battle between these powerful new warships. For the first time in naval history, a major battle was decided with no warship of either fleet even sighting an enemy ship directly. Aircraft were the new measure of naval power.&#10;&#10;Coral Sea is the new introductory boxed game for the Second World War at Sea series. It covers this key battle and is intended as a gateway for players new to the world's most popular series of naval boardgames. The Japanese player must establish new bases in New Guinea and at Tulagi in the Solomon Islands; the American player must stop them. Forces are very closely balanced, and victory will rest with the player who can best make use of his or her resources.&#10;&#10;The 22x17-inch operational map covers the Coral Sea off northeastern Australia as well as surrounding waters. Players maneuver their task forces on this map and search for one another with aircraft, submarines and surface ships. When contact is made, player moves to the tactical map.&#10;&#10;The tactical map is a generic blue field of hexagons, used to resolve surface combat. There, ships maneuver and fight using their gunnery and torpedo factors. Each player rolls a number of dice according to the ship&rsquo;s capabilities, hitting on a result of 6. Gunnery and torpedo damage tables give the results: ships can suffer damage to engines, hull or armament. Air attacks are resolved in similar fashion. The combat systems yield results rapidly but in a historically accurate fashion, giving a good balance of fun and insight.&#10;&#10;",

A shibumi object may appear simple but will reward the viewer with hidden depths as it is explored over time. Shibumi is simplicity hiding complexity.&#10;&#10;COMPONENTS&#10;&#10;The Shibumi set is not a single game but many games; it is the simplest of game systems. The set includes a square board with 4x4 holes and 48 white, black and red balls (16 each).&#10;&#10;Balls may only stack on 2x2 platforms of existing balls. Conversely, if a ball is removed then any others that it supports will drop. Any ball that directly supports two or more on the level above is pinned and cannot be removed. If a ball is not pinned then it&rsquo;s free.&#10;&#10;EDITIONS&#10;&#10;Published by nestorgames, it is presented in 3 editions:&#10;&#10;- Ninja: Small, light, portable. It includes a black and small cotton bag, a blue foam board, 19mm plastic balls in 3 colours (16 each of white, black and red), and a sheet with rules for 7 games.&#10;&#10;- Samurai: Big, solid, strong. It includes a big white bag, a laser-cut 8mm thick 'ice' acrylic board and 25mm phenolic resin balls (same material as snooker balls) in 3 colours (16 each of white, black and red), and a sheet with rules for 7 games. Optionaly 3 bowls for the marbles can be purchased.&#10;&#10;- Shogun: The executive edition for the big boss. It includes a big laser-cut 8mm thick 'ice' acrylic box with 4x4 holes on its lid, a big white bag, 25mm phenolic resin balls in 3 colours (16 each of white, black and red), and a pendrive with rules for many games. You will be able download future games and computer versions into your pendrive as they become available.&#10;&#10;The phenolic balls are absolutely exquisite as they are:&#10;&#10;- Light: around 15 grams each.&#10;- Round: each ball is perfectly spherical without blemish; they stack and drop correctly every time.&#10;- Warm: both in temperature and in the nice snooker ball &quot;clack&quot; they make when struck together.&#10;- Tough: they won't chip or crack and seem pretty much indestructible.&#10;&#10;They look and feel fantastic. When you pick them up you just want to keep fondling them.&#10;&#10;HISTORY&#10;&#10;Games and puzzles based on square pyramidal stackings have existed at least since Edouard Lucas' cannon-ball stacking problem of 1875. The most famous 4x4 square pyramidal game is Pylos (published by Gigamic). Shibumi is different due to the third ball colour, drop mechanism, different numbers of players, lack of a board gutter, and the fact that it's a system for playing many games rather than the embodiment of a single game. Some Shibumi games may be playable with a Pylos set but many will not.&#10;&#10;Shibumi game system concept by Cameron Browne 2011.&#10;&#10;GAMES&#10;&#10;This is the official geeklist of Shibumi games:&#10;&#10;Official Shibumi games list&#10;&#10;Please feel free to create your own game for this system!&#10;&#10;The names of these games all start with &lsquo;SP&rsquo; because they're Square Pyramidal games:&#10;&#10;",

It&rsquo;s a two player card game wherein one player attacks with bacteria, and the other defends with antibiotics. The game requires no prior knowledge of medicine, yet accurately reflects the current state of actual antibiotic use against the most common and most feared bacterial infections. Designed in a collaboration between hardcore gamers and practicing physicians, Defenders of Soma offers a complex strategic gameplay experience, while also increasing familiarity with today&rsquo;s medical quandries in the face of waning antibiotic effectiveness.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Overwhelmed by the stress of the hooligan hootenanny that's overrunning the bustling town of Bandit Bluff, the resident deputy has up and left his post! Sheriff Croc Holliday is shuffling and hustling to find his next deputy. Looking to fill the vacancy, Croc has decided to put a pool of new recruits to work helping clean up some of Bandit Bluff's most wanted outlaws and will choose the most dedicated to be the new deputy! A little lying, some stealthy scheming, and the sense to know a good time to tell the truth might just help give a leg up over the rest of the herd. Who will out-law the other applicants to become the new deputy?&#10;&#10;OutLawed! is a social game of bluffing, truth-telling, and out-thinking your opponents. Each player has an identical set of eleven outlaw cards imagined as animals escaped from the zoo somewhere in the wild, wild west. Over a series of rounds, players take turns playing a card face down and making a claim about which character card they played. Players are free to tell the truth about the character played or to make a bold-faced lie! After players have played cards and made their claims, all the characters are revealed and each player assesses whether or not they have met their outlaw's &quot;apprehend if&quot; condition. Players who were successful add their outlaws to their jail pile while all other players place the card back in their hand. Lionel Manesworth, for example, can be captured only if you tell the truth. The Vixen Twins get nabbed when others are convinced to play the same card during the round. Lawman Croc Holliday will catch anybody who isn't on the up and up.&#10;&#10;Once a player fills up their jail, everyone compares their total reward value of apprehended cards to see who has earned the most rewards and gets to fill the vacant position as deputy of Bandit Bluff.&#10;&#10;",

Each tile shows an icon on both the front and back: Lupin, Lady X, the Blue Lion diamond, or a police inspector. Each combination of two icons occurs once. One player plays as Lupin, the other as Lady X. During set-up, these tiles are arranged in a row. In turn, the players take one tile and add it to the front or the back of the line, without looking at the back of the tile. After this set-up, the players try to score points by creating special combinations of tiles. Each turn, a player can perform one of three actions to change the line:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Switch two adjacent tiles.&#10;    Move a tile that is on one end of the line to the other end of the line.&#10;    Flip a tile.&#10;&#10;&#10;If this action results in a scoring combination of three tiles, the player scores points. The combinations are:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Sandwiching a tile showing the opponent by two tiles showing police inspectors: 1 point.&#10;    Sandwiching a tile showing the Blue Lion by two tiles showing the player's character: 2 points.&#10;    Creating a row of three tiles showing the Blue Lion: 3 points.&#10;&#10;&#10;After a combination has been formed, the middle tile of the combination is removed. The opposing player then adds it to one end of the line, although he cannot score points by doing so.&#10;&#10;The first player to score seven points wins.&#10;&#10;",

Your primary objective will be for your regime to survive from 1953 through the year 2030. Your secondary objective will be to maximize adherence to the Juche ideology by progressively achieving national self-reliance and global influence. Juche points are earned by advancing your nation&rsquo;s military strength, industrial production, nuclear weapons development, and assertively responding to events while minimizing lingering foreign debt.

Despite ominous setbacks in Spain, Napoleonic France before 1812 was at the height of its expansion. The continental system was holding, if imperfectly. Monarchs friendly to the Empire (several, members of Napoleon&rsquo;s immediate family), ruled in every capital of the continent. Only Britain remained unbowed. By the end of 1813 the story had changed dramatically&hellip;&#10;&#10;Napoleon&rsquo;s Eagles is a highly playable, action-packed card game set during the wars of 19th Century Europe. Two battles are featured: Borodino, the sanguinary clash before the gates of Moscow featured in Tolstoy&rsquo;s famous novel War and Peace, and Leipzig, the great &ldquo;Battle of Nations&rdquo; which marked the beginning of the end of the French Empire.&#10;&#10;Two smaller battles are included (Shevardino and Lieberwolkwitz), as well as two campaign games that cover multiple days of battle: September 5th-7th, 1812 at Borodino and October 14th-18th, 1813 at Leipzig. The game includes rules for cavalry charges, artillery bombardment, army morale and army commanders. Emphasis is placed on the role of reserves and the judicious  commitment of infantry and cavalry. Key terrain pieces are featured, such as the city of Leipzig and the famous Great Redoubt at Borodino.&#10;&#10;Product information&#10;&#10;Complexity: 5 out of 10&#10;Solitaire Suitability: Low (card-driven game)&#10;Time Scale: abstract (one full day of battle is 6 turns)&#10;Unit Scale: Infantry and Cavalry Corps&#10;Players: Two&#10;Playing Time: 30 to 90 minutes; 4 hours for large campaign&#10;Designer: Christopher Moeller&#10;&#10;Components&#10;&#10;225 Poker-sized cards which include 89 Unit Cards, 32 Terrain and Info Cards, and 104 Playing Cards&#10;Two Player Aid Cards&#10;Three Scenario Set-up Cards&#10;One Rules and Scenario Book&#10;1 Box and Lid set&#10;&#10;",

Art school really broke the bank, so you must share a canvas with your rival classmates!&#10;&#10;Abstract Academy is played over three rounds by either two or four players, with the players completing a new canvas each round. At the start of the game, you lay out 2-3 scoring cards for each round, so you all know what you're trying to achieve to score. Additionally, at the start of each round, each player receives an inspiration card that shows a pattern they're trying to create on the canvas.&#10;&#10;In the two-player game, players take turns playing canvas cards into a shared 4x4 play area, and in the four-player game, they play in a shared 5x5 area. Canvas cards are divided into quadrants, and each quadrant is colored yellow, red, or blue. The canvas grows organically as you all play cards, and the edges aren't fixed until you have four (or five) cards in a row or column. The edge of the canvas closest to you is your home row, and once the canvas is locked in size, no one else can play in your home row (unless all other spaces are filled).&#10;&#10;Once the canvas is filled, the two rows closest to you form your scoring zone. If the color patterns in your zone complete a scoring card better than the patterns in anyone else's zone, then you claim the scoring card. Additionally, if you've created the right pattern in your scoring zone, you can score your inspiration card. Whoever has the most points after three rounds is the star pupil of Abstract Academy and wins!&#10;&#10;Admin note: The logo of Flatout Games is shown on the English-language edition of Abstract Academy, but Flatout Games is not involved with the publication of this game.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Quantum physics tells us &lsquo;the ability of quantum particles to occupy two states seemingly at once could be explained by both states co-existing in different universes&rsquo;. So when you wave goodbye to your ship in your universe, someone else waves goodbye to their ship in a different parallel universe. But what would happen if these neighboring universes, separated by the thinnest, gossamer barrier should somehow be breached and my ship sails into your world and searches for gold in competition to your ship? Play the game and find out...&#10;&#10;Ni&ntilde;a &amp; Pinta is a game of exploration of the New World where the great nations of Spain, England, France and Portugal send ships out to map the unknown and to bring home wealth to the Old World. This is a game where those ships will cross the divide and where no love is lost between Captains no matter which world it is! Explore, settle, fight if need be, and help your nation develop its Culture, Science, Religion and War-craft, to be the best in all worlds!&#10;&#10;No dice rolling in this Ragnar game, but plenty of tension as players can launch offensives with their Captains after first using them to flip land tiles thereby exploring each New World. Settlers are placed in explored lands to generate gold revenue. When combinations of terrain are occupied, towns and cities can be built. Meanwhile gold is used in the Old World to buy items to benefit further New World development or to accumulate the victory points generated by Culture, Science, Religion and War which themselves are meshed with what is taking place in the three New Worlds.&#10;&#10;This is a tightly knit puzzle that will have players pondering a multiplicity of decisions from start to finish. As much of the play is simultaneous and &quot;single-action&quot;, there is little downtime. The game has a good sense of growth worthy of its fascinating theme.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Assault &ndash; Red Horizon 41&#10;&#10;is the first volume in a planned series of tactical level wargames in which players lead historical units into battle during Operation Barbarossa (June through October 1941). A Clash of Titans &ndash; the German Army and the Soviet Army fighting one another in a life and death struggle with infantry, artillery and armored units.&#10;&#10;Assault &ndash; Red Horizon 41 is intentionally not intended to be a simulation, but rather it abstracts certain aspects in favor of playability and manageable game length to convey the feeling of comprehensive tactical combat situations.&#10;&#10;Game Mechanics and rules: &#10;&#10;The Assault Game System is designed to be completely modular and to accommodate a wide range of preferences for those playing it. There are different scenarios that the players can choose from, and within these scenarios, the Order of Battle can vary through the use of Formation Cards. In each scenario, rather than being given a set Order of Battle, the players will randomly select Formation Cards (infantry, artillery, or armor/vehicle) based on the side they are playing.&#10;&#10;The Formation Cards give the player a certain number and type of units available for the scenario. This ensures both variation and regular surprises, since the make-up of your forces will change from game to game. Your High Command has assigned you certain units to achieve a particular goal; you will have to adjust your individual tactics based on the available units and the objectives you have been given!&#10;&#10;Units in the Assault Game System are activated by Command points. Players receive a certain number of Command points, which are listed on the Formation cards. Before Command Phase, players secretly decide (behind a small screen or divider) which units to activate in the current turn. The Command point allowance lets the player activate approximately 75% of all available units. Thus, players must set priorities for the turn. Not only does this speed up the game play, since all units are not used in each turn, but it also makes for some exciting moments in the fight.&#10;&#10;In the Assault Game System, we have tried to minimize the counter stacking issue. With many game systems in the hobby, you can find towers of counters and markers on certain hexes of the game board. The overview is then quickly lost. In the Assault Game System, there is a clear limit of one unit counter per hex, with the exception being when units in are being transported. In addition, there is usually only one command and/or status marker.&#10;&#10;Regarding Command and Unit State Markers, we have devised a simple double-marker system: each marker is double-sided and after the end of the round, in the Organization Phase, the markers are simply flipped or removed depending on their color. This helps to speed up play.&#10;&#10;In general, Assault has attempted to emphasize game flow. The fact that Command Points are assigned to activate units in the Planning Phase accelerates the game. Since the units to be activated are already established before the Action Phase, there is less for the player to think about and fewer opportunities for AP to set in.&#10;&#10;The Dynamic Campaign System: &quot;Crossing the Narew&quot; &#10;&#10;&quot;It  is  the  end  of  June  1941,  when  the  German  Wehrmacht  begins  the  largest  land  operation  of  World  War II,  Operation  Barbarossa.  More  than  four  million  German  soldiers  are  in  their  starting  positions  on  the eastern  borders  of  the  German  Reich.  The  strategic  objective  is  the  capital  Moscow.  To  be  successful, the  operation  must  combine  strength  with  speed.  Key  to  this  will  be  seizing  control  the  bridges  that  lie between  the  German  Wehrmacht  and  its  ultimate  prize.&#10;&#10;In  this  campaign,  players  take  on  the  role  of  a  company  commander  in  order  to  achieve  victory  for  their own  faction.  Each  serving  in  the  ranks  of  one  of  the  two  divisions  that  took  part  historically,  the  German 7th  Infantry  Division  and  the  Soviet  13th  Rifle  Division. The  campaign  consists  of  four  connected  battles  and  covers  the  period  24-25  June  1941.  This  campaign is  in  line  with  historical  operations  for  crossing  the  Narew  River.  This  crossing  was    important  and  had  to be  achieved  quickly  in  order  to  close  the  town  of  Bialystok  and  the  connected  basin.&quot;&#10;&#10;Another aspect that sets Assault Red Horizons &rsquo;41 apart from the competition is our Dynamic Campaign Systemwhich will be included in the base game. We have designed a system whereby multiple scenarios can be linked with a variable starting set up for each subsequent scenario dependent upon how many of the victory conditions each side achieves. The players conduct operations, each commanding a company of troops from regiments that actually served on the Eastern Front. The campaign includes 8 different plots for a high replay value.&#10;&#10;",

Uncovering the Cataclysm is only half the battle - once uncovered, the Agents must overcome the Cataclysm's unique effect and drive the evil back out of this world, using the research, investigation, artifact, and talisman cards they've collected throughout the game.&#10;&#10;With over a dozen cataclysms, who knows what the more malicious denizens of London are up to in the shadows.&#10;&#10;Scales for 1-4 players to enjoy in 60-90 minutes.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "&quot;Fury at Midway&quot; has been originally published in Japanese by Bonsai Game as &ldquo;Midway: Turning the Tide in the Pacific&rdquo;. Changes in this Revolution Games version include making it a two map game, one for each player, which makes for an increased degree of hidden information regarding air strikes, damage, and combat air patrol. Four additional event cards were added to better cover the range of historical events of the battle. Anti-aircraft fire was reduced and rules for hitting the wrong carrier force were introduced. The map areas were expanded a hex row and the counter art was redone as well as many other small changes.&#10;&#10;The game system is primarily one of air operations. When to strike and with what planes is the primary question of the game. This is balanced by how you defend your own fleet and the island of Midway for the Americans or the invasion fleet for the Japanese. The Japanese have to either take Midway or win the carrier battle to win the game and having two objectives really challenges the Japanese player to make a good plan while the American situation is simpler but his forces are not as well trained and errors in navigation, strike coordination, escort, etc can take a toll. Surface forces are not shown in the game except in their effects in AAA, bombardment, or the slight chance of an abstract night surface battle. This is a simple yet pretty accurate version of Midway that was a lot of fun during testing.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Unlike most games, in Trench the 8x8 grid board is diamond-shaped; each player sets up his army on opposing sides of the &quot;trench&quot;, which divides the board into two. As hostilities between the armies commanded by the players grow, each attempts to seize control over the trench in order to take full advantage of its strategic potential, hoping thus to breach the opponent's defenses and capture the most valuable and important pieces.&#10;&#10;From the Soldiers to the General, each piece being subject to specific maneuvers, all will have to cooperate in order to be able to occupy the trench, invade the enemy's territory, and vanquish the foe. The army that manages to survive after two battles wins the game!&#10;&#10;",

These elections will name the nine representatives who will sit at the high council. Each party must carefully divide its soldiers, merchants and priests, to obtain the majority of votes during the elections. These elections follow each another in each of the areas of the city. The struggle is tense and all manner of dirty tricks are allowed. Each faction has the capacity to apply pressure on the others and has the chance of canceling their votes.

The game was originally devised as a fencing system, with background added to provide scenarios for the duels. After a time, it became apparent that the background was more fun than the duels, and En Garde, in its present form, was born.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;In En Garde, a player finds himself born into and educated in a world where social climbing is a way of life, and status is a goal to be pursued even over money. It is a world inhabited by Cyrano, Roxanne, Scaranouche, Errol Flynn, Porthos, Athos, Aramis, Rhonda Fleming, Francois Villon, Constance, and, of course, D'Artagnan. There are people to be used, friends in high places to be cultivated, enemies to be humiliated, the Cardinal's Guard to be trounced, lackies to be abused, the hand of a fair damsel to be won, and the ear of the King to be gained. Come with us now, to those vibrant, bawdy days of Yore.&quot;&#10;&#10;A pencil and paper game in the style of an RPG, and with much of the detail expected in an RPG of the time, but with the &quot;adventure&quot; structure built into charts and tables so that no referee was required.

If you play your cards right, you'll be backing the winners and score thanks to their efforts.&#10;&#10;Dice Run includes thirty dice, with six dice in each of five different colors. To start the game, you roll these dice on the table to form the starting pack of runners. Each player has a hand of three movement cards and four secret target cards; these latter cards show a die with a particular number and color.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player plays a movement card and carries out its effect. If he chooses a red movement card, for example, all of the red dice &quot;break out&quot; of the pack and move ahead to form the leading group of runners. If the next player plays a 5 movement card, she first moves ahead all of the 5s from the leading group &ndash; thereby forming a new leading group &ndash; then she moves all the 5s from the next group in line ahead one group. Movement cards also allow players to switch the position of two non-leading groups, to drop a die from the leading group to the back of the pack, to flip all the dice in a group that match a particular number, to have three dice break out from the leading group, and so on. Alternatively, a player can place a movement card face down on the table, then roll all the dice in a non-leading group; he can't take this option again until another player makes such a roll. After playing a card, he refills his hand to three movement cards.&#10;&#10;A player can also choose to use one of his secret target cards to move the dice, first moving all the dice of the matching number, then all dice of the matching color, or vice versa. This card remains on the table.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, the movement deck is seeded with four stage cards valued 3-6. When a stage card is revealed, players each simultaneously reveal one of their secret target cards. (If a player used a target card for movement, he must choose this card.) For each die in the leading group that matches the color of this card, the player scores 1 point; he also scores 1 point for each matching number. If a die is identical to his target card, he scores 1 bonus point as well. Whoever has the highest score claims the stage card, which is worth 3-6 stage points. The players with the second- and third-highest scores receive 2 and 1 stage point.&#10;&#10;After four stages, the player with the most stage points wins!&#10;&#10;",

Ships can be customized to your individual playstyle, whether you prefer to deal direct damage, or support teammates by disabling enemy shields and stations.&#10;&#10;Each round consists of the following phases:&#10;1) Planning: Players travel to nearby planets. Players may also repair and upgrade their ships or hire new crew members during this time.&#10;2) Encounter: Players combat enemy fleets or resolve missions (together or alone).&#10;3) Resolution: Event cards and hazard effects are resolved.

He did not know that a hard fought six year war had just begun.&#10;&#10;The Library of Napoleonic Battles TLNB-series, evolved from the very successful Napoleon&acute;s Last Battles, combining a high level of historical detail and beautiful and accurate maps with excellent playability, is covering, at Brigade level, (almost) every major Napoleonic battle. &#10;  Napoleon in Spain is focusing on the first and second British interventions in Portugal and Spain in 1808 and in the two major battles of the second campaign of the &quot;Guerra de la Independencia&quot; in 1808.&#10;&#10;Battles simulated are &#10;&#10;     Vimeiro - Wellington vs Junot.

    "description": "From the Developer's Website:&#10;&#10;Bushido is an oriental fantasy tabletop miniature battle game for two players. Each player commands a force of no more than a handful of individuals, represented by 32mm metal miniatures. These forces meet on the battlefield and the commanders (the players, that is) try to outwit, outfight and outlive the opposing force and fulfil their battle objectives while denying the enemy theirs. If you have played tabletop miniature games before, Bushido falls into the &lsquo;skirmish game&rsquo; category: all miniatures represent individuals and your force consists of a small group of unique characters rather than a big faceless army. A game of Bushido is fast-moving, flexible and filled with strategizing, counter-strategizing and counter-counter-strategizing. Your tactical acumen is important, but as dice add an element of randomness, so too is your ability to think on your feet. A typical game of Bushido takes between one and two hours to play - more if you are new to the game, less if you are a seasoned veteran.&#10;&#10;",

Do you dare venture into the depths and combat what monsters lurk inside?&#10;&#10;Wakening Lair is a fully cooperative dungeon delve for 2-6 players who take on the roles of heroic adventurers banded together to defeat the monsters inhabiting a nearby lair. Play heroes from nine different character classes, each with unique abilities to help vanquish foes. Double-sided hero cards provide both male and female versions of each class for a total of 18 heroes from which to choose.&#10;&#10;A variety of monsters, nine different monstrous terrors, and randomized boss monster awakening changes the game narrative each time you play. Six different room types can give you an attack bonus if your character type matches the room advantage. Weapons have character preferences and arming the right weapons can increase the power of your attacks. Use magical items for rerolls, healing, or other boosts for yourself or members of your party. Monsters have attack vulnerabilities and immunities, so you need to watch out and square off with the best suited members of your team!&#10;&#10;Players take turns exploring rooms in Wakening Lair, defeating monsters, disarming traps, and gathering weapons and magic items. Equip those items to maximize your hero's abilities, all in preparation to defeat the slumbering monstrous terror that is bound to awaken at any moment. When it does, you need all your collective power to keep it from escaping the lair and destroying the land!&#10;&#10;",

He decided to hide them in his pyramid to prevent then from being stolen.  Unfortunately he is no longer sure where he has buried what.  With luck you will be able to help him find his treasure again. The player that finds the most of the Pharaoh's treasures and thereby collects the greatest number of search cards is the winner.&#10;&#10;After chips have placed in the game board, pyramids placed on top and the board spun around a few times in the hopes the players won&rsquo;t know where treasure chips are located, the first player chooses a treasure card which assigns the number or points that the treasure will be worth would the player find it. The treasure cards have been separated into three piles marked 1, 2 and 3. Once pile 1 is exhausted, game continues with pile 2, etc. Then the player slides a pyramid into an empty space on the board. If no treasure chip is found, the player moves another pyramid. If the chip does not match his card, their turn is over. If the treasure is found, the player keeps the treasure card but the token stays where it is.&#10;&#10;Mixed in with the treasure cards are event cards as follows:&#10;&#10;Sandstorm: Turn the board through 180 degrees and take the next pile from the card.&#10;&#10;Gift: Move to one of the twelve treasures.  Each player that has one or more search cards depicting this treasure must give you one of them.&#10;&#10;Risk: Nominate two treasures that are not currently displayed on the board.  Move first to one and then to the other.  If you succeed - well done!  If you don't then you must give one of your opponents' one of your search cards.&#10;&#10;Mirage: You draw a search card from your right hand neighbor's collection.  If you are able to move to this treasure without making a mistake then you may keep the card.  If you do not manage it then you must give your right hand neighbor one of your cards.&#10;&#10;Desert Poker: A player of you choice must try to find a treasure that you nominate.  If he succeeds then he can take one of your search cards.  If he fails then you can take one of his.&#10;&#10;End Game: The Pharaoh is happy because all the treasure has been found.  As soon as this (Pile 3 only) card is turned over the game ends and the players total up the points that are shown on their search cards.&#10;&#10;After each player has found a treasure the board is rotated through 90 degrees in a chosen direction.&#10;&#10;Once all the search cards from the second pile are used up then pile &quot;3&quot; is used.  In this final round all the treasures on the search cards are worth 4 points and anyone who has not yet been particularly successful can, with brains and luck, overtake all the others.&#10;&#10;When a player finds a treasure chip that is not the one that he was looking for he is out of the game.  The remaining players continue.  Play continues until all the players are eliminated or the End Game Card is turned over.&#10;&#10;All the players total up the points that they have showing on the search cards they have collected.  The player with the greatest number of points is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

Whoever delivers the lowest yield in a round receives the least Glory, but the most thalers for further investments. Consequently, players need to decide in each round whether they want to earn more thalers in order to invest in the development of their monastery, or to obtain more Glory in order to be the winner in the end.&#10;&#10;But each player pursues his own plans, so every round brings a scramble for the best ranking on the street to Cluny, which might bring unpleasant surprises to some players.&#10;&#10;",

Murat&rsquo;s early gains were soon forfeit against the two advancing Austrian corps, but these two corps become separated by the Apennine Mountains. Like Napoleon&rsquo;s Waterloo campaign, Murat hoped to defeat each corps in turn before they could reunite. One player commands the Neapolitan army under King Joachim Murat; the other player commands the Austrian army under Feldmarschall-Leutnant Freidrich Baron Bianchi.&#10;&#10;Waterloo 20, 3rd Edition from Joseph Miranda is a game based on the Waterloo campaign of 15-18 June 1815. One player commands the French army, taking the role of the returning Emperor Napoleon. The other player assumes both the roles of Wellington for the Anglo-Dutch forces, and Bl&uuml;cher for the Prussian forces, respectively.&#10;&#10;Two months after returning to France, Napoleon had an army of 280,000 men and was mobilizing half as many again for the next two months, but he was set upon by Allied coalition armies of nearly 1,000,000 soldiers who were preparing to move against France. The British (110,000 men) and Prussians (120,000 men) were closest, in Belgium, and Napoleon struck first before their numbers could be combined against him. With speed and surprise, he invaded Belgium with fully 125,000 men in a bid to defeat each of these armies in turn before they could unite.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Omaha - The Bloody Beach, D-Day: June 6 to 8, 1944 is Game #3 in the 'Tactical Combat Series&quot; (TCS) from The Gamers.&#10;&#10;Huge simulation covering half of the Omaha Beach assault on D-Day, June 6th, 1944. This includes primarily the units of the U.S. 1st Infantry Division, but also some troops of the 29th.&#10;&#10;This game game with the old 2nd edition TCS rules, which had some issues especially regarding artillery. However, available for download from Multi-Man Publishing (and in Operations Magazine issue #21) are rules for playing the game under the much more streamlined TCS 3.1 Rulebook, and with these the game is very playable. Of course, that is a relative term given that the game includes (4) maps and 1680 counters and takes quite a commitment in time and space to play. Very satisfying though.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 20 minutes&#10;Hex: 125 yards / 114 meters&#10;Units: Infantry squads, individual vehicles&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;Four 22 x 34&quot; full color maps&#10;Six dual-side printed countersheets (1,680 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 32-page TCS system rulebook&#10;One 32-page Omaha specific rulebook&#10;Four 6-sided dice&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: Moderate&#10;Complexity Level: High&#10;Players: 2-4&#10;Playing Time: 8-60 hours&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Traces of Hubris is a two-player game that simulates the German Case Blue (Fall Blau) summer offensive in southern Russia during the second half of 1942. The goal was to &ldquo;cut off&rdquo; the Volga at Stalingrad and to capture the Caucasus oil fields.&#10;&#10;The Axis player must eliminate the Soviet forces and break their defense lines in order to reach his objectives. The Soviet player must do everything to defend the homeland, and hold until he gets a chance to strike back.

    "description": "Munchkin Axe Cop is a simple, lightweight multiplayer &quot;take that&quot; style card game. Cards represent character abilities, items, monsters to fight, and cards to make monsters harder to defeat (for monsters other players are fighting) or easier to defeat (for you). Every time you defeat a monster, you go up a level. The first player to level 10 wins.&#10;&#10;This is a core set for Steve Jackson's Munchkin game, based on the hit webcomic by Ethan Nicolle (age 29) and his brother Malachai (age 6). It can be combined with other games in the series.&#10;&#10;The game doesn't have any new mechanics and should be easy to learn for anyone who's played one of the other Munchkin games. Hirelings are included and are called allies. There are four classes: Cop, Man, Soldier, and Warrior (which is identical to the class of the same name in fantasy Munchkin). This set also has powers; there are seven of them with two cards each, for a total of 14 cards. The mechanics of powers are exactly the same as in the other Munchkin sets that have them.&#10;&#10;Several Santa monsters are included, as well as two new monster categories, Alien and Robot, which currently aren't recognized in any of the other Munchkin games.&#10;&#10;It's not necessary to know anything about the Axe Cop webcomic in order to enjoy this set.&#10;&#10;Part of the Munchkin series.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "extrapolated from the preview:&#10;&#10;The essence of the game is that you are moving from one to four pawns around the country, landing in cities, and scoring &quot;votes&quot; in the appropriate state which are proportional to the size of the city. Each turn, you move and add votes to the states you land in.&#10;&#10;There are many complications that can occur. You can sit out a turn and collect money. With money, you can buy &quot;organization&quot; in a state, acting as a multiplier to all subsequent votes you get in that state. You can buy &quot;advertising&quot; - most useful in buying votes in piddly states that you're too busy to visit. You can buy &quot;surrogates&quot; which are additional pawns who may travel, garnering votes, just like your candidate. You can buy &quot;special flights&quot; that help you get to places without the luck of the dice.&#10;&#10;The most characteristic part of the game comes in the &quot;issues&quot;. Each player picks a politician with his own profile on how he stands on various issues. Then either through choice or chance cards, issues become &quot;active&quot;. As long as the issue is active, politicians with a relevant stand will have bonuses or penalties when he visits certain states. The game strongly encourages role playing.&#10;&#10;The climax of the game comes at the end, as you go down each state to see who has the most votes, thereby winning that state's delegates. There is a smart balloting system, in which the lowest scoring player drops out, giving his states' votes to the next strongest in each state. This continues, with players dropping out in each successive ballot until a winner is chosen.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "It's the year 325 and it's a pretty chill time to be a Christian.&#10;&#10;Not only has it been a hot minute since they were forced to renounce their faith on pain of death, but the emperor Constantine has really leaned into it, hoping it will unite the often fractured Roman Empire. So, the big guy isn&rsquo;t super-thrilled when bishops immediately get into nit-picky, esoteric arguments that John Quintus Romanus doesn&rsquo;t give two flips about. He demands that the bishops gather together in the city of Nicaea to come to an accord. He doesn&rsquo;t really care what these nerds decide, so long as they decide something.&#10;&#10;This gathering is given irreverent treatment by Amabel Holland in this game for four, five, or six players. Like Constantine, it treats the theological positions argued at the first ecumenical council as fungible. Whether a position ends up accepted orthodoxy or damnable heresy has nothing to do with theology and everything to do with politics - with personal ambition, petty rivalries, and social dynamics. This is a sort of shared incentives game, in which each player commits to one of two sides in various theological disputes; guess which one the majority will go with and you&rsquo;ll score points. Score the most points, and you&rsquo;ll win the game.&#10;&#10;Unless the player with the fewest points has accumulated the most political influence. That player is powerful enough to splinter the church, provoking a schism and stealing the win. To prevent this, you&rsquo;ll need to make sure that someone that powerful isn&rsquo;t left out in the cold during the final settlement.&#10;&#10;At once a slick tableau-building game and a study in emergent alliances, Nicaea gives a rude but affectionate raspberry to what was perhaps the most pivotal event in the history of the early church.&#10;&#10;",
