    "description": "As a recently-crowned Dwarven King, you'd quite like a palace. Your followers would rather spend their days fighting amongst themselves and drinking. Good luck with that.&#10;&#10;Hall of the Dwarven King is a dice game for one player. Each of your seven dice represents the whims of one of your followers, Sometimes they'll feel like mining or building, but just as often, they'd rather drink or get into fights.&#10;&#10;Try to order them around too much and they'll just walk off. So if you want a palace (Which, of course you do) you'll need to work around the Dwarves' inclinations, build Taverns and Gaming halls so they'll be happier doing what you say, or just bribe them if you have the cash.&#10;&#10;All you need to play Hall of the Dwarven King is the PDF, a pencil and seven standard dice.&#10;&#10;&#10;Released in the February 2018 Board Game of the Month Club $5+ package.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "The year is 2023 and the world is buzzing with excitement as a groundbreaking new project is announced. A leading corporation in space exploration has unveiled its plans to build a lunar complex unlike any other. The name of this project is LUNARIS 45, and its goal is to create a fully operational lunar colony that will be run entirely by artificial intelligence.&#10;As news of this project spreads, it captures the imagination of people all over the world. The idea of a self-sufficient lunar complex, with its own power sources, food production, and communication systems, is both ambitious and awe-inspiring. And with the use of advanced AI technology, the possibilities seem endless.&#10;&#10;But as with any groundbreaking project, there are also concerns. Some wonder if the reliance on AI will make the colony vulnerable to malfunctions or even takeover by rogue AI. Others worry about the impact that such a project might have on the future of humanity.&#10;To address the concerns of vulnerability surrounding the LUNARIS 45 project, the corporation has assembled a team of the world&rsquo;s top experts in disaster response, AI safety, and cybersecurity. These scientists are tasked with identifying and anticipating any catastrophic scenarios that might arise from running a lunar colony entirely by AI.&#10;&#10;But these experts are not paid in the usual way. Instead, they are offered a unique incentive: for every problem they solve, they will receive a generous amount of credits.&#10;&#10;This payment system ensures that the team is motivated to work tirelessly, leaving no stone unturned in their quest to make the LUNARIS 45 project as safe and secure as possible. From the possibility of a solar flare disrupting the colony&rsquo;s power supply to the risk of rogue AI causing a catastrophic malfunction, the team of experts works to identify every conceivable problem and develop plans to mitigate them.&#10;Players will take on the role of one of these experts. Players will use their knowledge and powerful computers to predict and solve any problem that may arise. Players will be upgrading these computers to achieve better results and solve even more complicated problems. Players will also be working in a vast network where they can share knowledge and achieve the optimal solution to the most varied problems.&#10;&#10;Players will be rolling dice to match the values on problem cards in order to solve any catastrophic events. Players will be able to upgrade their inventory by buying more dice, more rerolls, and the opportunity to use the dice of other players. Every problem card solved will grant players credits that may be exchanged for Euros, but the more players upgrade the worst their conversion ratio of credits to euros becomes.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

It features die-cut counters, an enlarged map, and integrates the More Battle for China expansion kit (more rules, two extra half-maps and more counters to game out the rest of World War Two (1942-45) and the Civil War (1947-49)).&#10;&#10;June 2009: Fiery Dragon productions has come out with &quot;Battle for China Deluxe&quot;, a special edition of the game that includes the expansion kit More Battle for China. The package includes:&#10;&#10;- 44-page integrated rulebook for all three games, with coil binding&#10;- two red dice&#10;- 12 cards for the various charts and tables for the three games&#10;- 5 sheets of counters, for a total of 480 counters - consisting of the three sheets for the original game, and two new ones for the expansion. Counters might still be a bit thin for some tastes (but then they would not fit in the box) but the diecutting is good.&#10;- 3 maps, the original 11x17&quot; central map plus the north and south 8x11&quot; extensions (Siberia-Manchuria and Siam-Burma-India, respectively). The North map matches up well and obviously. For the South map the area north of Burma-1 is Burma-3, and the area north of Burma-2 is Burma-4. The unnamed area north of India-8 is Nepal and is impassable.&#10;&#10;This was the last version of Battle for China to appear before the Decision Games edition of the basic 1937-41 game in late 2009. Production of the deluxe version is limited, fewer than 125 copies I believe.&#10;&#10;When the Decision Games edition appears, the designer will post an updated and integrated set of rules and charts for the expansion kit, along with homemade redrawn extension maps to fit the larger 22x34&quot; map. The counter sheets provided do not need to be changed, but be advised that the counters in the Decision Games edition have been changed to iconic style, with a different format.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Battle for China, 1937-1941 (Second Edition)&#10;&#10;&#10;",

During rounds the ships will sail past each other zone for zone in a modular style. During each step of sailing, players will be able to draw and play an action card which will either help them place new sailors and cannons on their ship, utilize movement of units or the ships themselves, or attack the enemy ship. Play happens simultaniously throughout the game, which means the game has litte idle time. In between rounds players have the option of swapping cards from- and into their playing deck, which changes the capabilities of each player for the next round.&#10;&#10;You win a game by either destroying three zones on the enemy ship to sink them, or get rid of the entire enemy crew as to set them adrift into the rocks.&#10;&#10;You will have to position your crewmen and cannons tactically to do as much damage to the enemy boat as possible, all the while trying to avoid your opponent from doing the same to you. Aside from that, you have your captain to think about. Losing them is a costly mistake and will give opponent the upperhand. A game focused on patience, tactics and outwitting your opponent.&#10;&#10;",

Each turn, the player lays two tiles and then draws replacements from the bag. Tiles are double-sided (where each side is the mirror image of the other), so tiles can be flipped as well as rotated. &#10;The idea of the game is to score points by completing snakes. The longer the snake, the more points you score (and you can score double points by completing two snakes with one move). Because any tiles played must match existing tiles on the table, it is possible to block opponent's plays as well as setting oneself up for a big score. There is a constant anxiety over whether to complete a snake to secure the points, or extend it in the hope of landing a bigger score later on.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "October 1941: After the initial success against the Russian &quot;Bear&quot; in the summer of 1941 the German advance slowed down. Hitler advised the commander of the 17th Army, General Erich von Manstein, to take the Crimean Peninsula and the important port of Sevastopol before the winter weather would set in. After a quick successful campaign with the final conquest of the Crimea as its goal, the German Wehrmacht should have gained itself a good stepping stone for the next summer offensive to reach the most important oilfields of the Caucasus. Also the mighty Black Sea Fleet would be disloged to the far away port of Batumi...&#10;&#10;But history took a different turn. The initial assault failed to take the fortress. The Russians counterattacked in the winter with some success. And so Manstein&rsquo;s final conquest of the mighty Crimean fortress lasted until July 1942 when there were no more Soviet fighting formations on the Crimea.&#10;&#10;Fortress Sevastopol is a simulation of the German assault on the Crimean Peninsula. The Germans had to advance to Sevastopol as quickly as possible. Eventually the mighty fortress will have to surrender before the snow falls, which would be a great pleasure for the &quot;F&uuml;hrer&quot;. If not, you will have to wait until spring to receive more reserves and finally capture Sevastopol before the game ends.&#10;&#10;If you play the Russian side: stay cool! Try to avoid losses in the initial onslaught. Collect units and reserves in the winter months for an eventual counterstrike at the German weak points. If this is unsuccessful, go for entrenchments and fight for every meter in Sevastopol til the end.&#10;&#10;Fortress Sevastopol uses an easy to learn area movement and combat system. A similar system was already used in games like Breakout Normandy, Monty's Gamble - Market Garden, and Storm Over Arhhem. Fortress Sevastopol is Issue #8 in UBB's Command &amp; Strategy magazine series.&#10;&#10;",

Colorful clouds form on the ceiling and slowly form shapes before your eyes.  Not understanding how or why, you&rsquo;ve found yourself in the dreamlike world of Hypnos.  Find your way out!  To do so, sharpen your wits, patience and powers of observation.&#10;&#10;The Mazescape saga introduces a completely unique concept that fans of logic and puzzles will love.  In this original game from Devir, you will place a map on the table and look for the compass rose as the starting point of the maze.  Using the wooden styles that comes with the game, you&rsquo;ll trace the white pathways, maintaining contact with the maze at all times, and you&rsquo;ll open and close sections of the map while looking for the exit point of the Impossible Triangle.  Pass under bridges, climb staircases, and keep your head from spinning until the exit point takes you to the next scenario.&#10;&#10;Each Mazescape box contains seven different challenges to face.  The first maze is a relatively accessible challenge, and little by little the mazes become increasingly difficult until the final elegant explosion of pathways, which can only be untangled by the sharpest minds.&#10;&#10;Moreover, each map includes a series of secondary challenges that allow you to travel through a second time, giving each set of maps a high degree of re-playability.  Look for all of the hidden treasures in the seven maps.  And the portable format is easy to play anywhere; all you need is a place to set the map and the stylus to start your journey.  But beware, nobody said that escaping from the labyrinth would be easy!&#10;&#10;Mazescape Hipnos is the Mazescape version designed specially for kids. Simple challenges for the whole family, with a difficulty level specially adjusted for +6 years old players!&#10;&#10;",

Just the cards.&#10;&#10;The game also takes an average of 3 minutes to learn due to the fact that all the cards tell you exactly how to play them, and there are no other resources required.&#10;&#10;When the deck runs out, players discard cards on their turn instead of drawing, ensuring that there will always only be 1 winner.&#10;&#10;The game has a ton of humor in it, and is great for 1v1's and small groups.&#10;&#10;Players are constantly coming up with plans that other players are constantly ruining, and emotions can get playfully heated!&#10;&#10;The lighthearted design of the cards adds a great personal touch to the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

As players move about the darkened house they are likely to meet Dracula or one of his vampires and be turned into VAMPIRES themselves. The mood in the house is set by the cassette tape, with the sound of eerie music, doors slamming, wind howling, thunder crashing, along with the VOICE OF DOOM, and the TOLL OF BELLS! You and your friends are guaranteed an evening of laughter, fun and scares. No Game ever plays the same. The more often the game is played the more fun everyone will have as they become skilled in the art of detecting and avoiding Dracula.&quot;&#10;&#10;The players are travellers which are stuck in a small tavern in the woods during a storm. One of them is Count Dracula, the evil vampire. The players try to discover Dracula's identity. &#10;All players gather around the &quot;wheel of fortune&quot; and explore the playing area from here.

But War is approaching. Built with the help of the Tokugawa clan during a brief time of allegiance, the 38,000 Tokugawa troops now march towards Ueda Castle on the way to the Battle of Sekigahara. Sanada with only 2,500 men holds them off long enough that their chance to contribute military might to the main battle is missed. This and many other outnumbered battle victories earn Sanada the title of Crimson Demon of War.&#10;&#10;With 3 ways to win, your defeat will be a surprise to you every time. Quick and painless defeat will have you playing more than 1 game every time ROKUMON comes out. Can you see how the battle will play out?&#10;&#10;Your limited actions make this a simple game to learn: Deploy troops of various strengths. Move them to cover the enemy or reinforce a position. Fight your rivals and reveal unit strength. Surprise your opponent with a bold - once per game move.&#10;&#10;Play just one act, or play through all 6 acts following 100 years of Sanada history. Winning the most acts determines the winner of the game. However, each defeat grants you a one-time use attack bonus.

It was thought very little infantry would be needed.&#10;&#10;In the end, when the last Allied troops evacuated, the casualty count for both sides topped half-a-million. (And Churchill lost his job.)&#10;&#10;And yet, the big naval attack had almost succeeded. The Allies would not know until after the war ended how close they had come to achieving their breakthrough on the Dardanelles. It was the first of many &quot;what might have been&quot; episodes, where success was just one more push, one more aggressive movement away...in contrast to many times when failure was reinforced and repeated.&#10;&#10;Gallipoli is held as something sacred by the Australians and New Zealanders... as though they own it. The British would point out that the ANZACs made up less than 10% of the overall force and suffered less than 10% of the casualties. (But you can still get into a fight in Sydney if you talk like this!)&#10;&#10;A Fatal Attraction brings this campaign of tragedy and opportunity to life. The counters represent brigades, batteries, and ships, and players have the chance to do better than their historical counterparts, while gaining a greater appreciation for the difficulties faced by both sides, including supply shortages, command/control difficulties, and random events.&#10;&#10;With A Fatal Attraction, you'll find everything you need to understand Gallipoli except the smell and the flies.&#10;&#10;Published in Against the Odds magazine #20, August 2007&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Turn: 1 week&#10;Map: Area&#10;Unit: Infantry Regiments/Brigades, Artillery Batteries and individual ships&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 22&quot; X 34&quot; mapsheet&#10;One countersheet (280 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 12 page Game Rulebook&#10;Four pages of chart &amp; tables&#10;Complexity - Medium&#10;Solitaire suitability - Low&#10;Playing time - Up to 6 hours&#10;&#10;",

There are also advantages to be gained from supplying ore to the trading ships at the most opportune moment.&#10;&#10;Do you have what it takes to outdo the competition and build the most successful mining operation?&#10;&#10;Periorbis is a game for 2-6 players. Key mechanics are the asteroids, which are move into and out of range of the players according to a fixed cycle, and the employees, which range from untrained cadets to highly trained professionals.

Through the strategic use of occupations, constructions of buildings, each player can collaborate or interfere with other players to the enlargement of their territories and sphere of influence.&#10;&#10;Guild Stack is a game of speed and strategy, in which players are competing with all means to further their development. The buildings on the game ground are available for common use, using them for your purpose might have unintended consequences by profiting others. In some cases, other players can benefit even more from the buildings you made than yourself! The players have to work around this dilemma by developing their own strategy.&#10;&#10;In Guild Stack players players start with 3 lands. Every turn you add a building to one of these lands. In a turn you can also acquire an occupation if one of your lands has no occupation on it and the required buildings are present. These occupations are mostly triggered by the building of certain buildings. You can do this yourself or react to your opponents. When triggered you can (among others) get points or more lands. There are also options to sabotage the buildings of other players. Combined with the triggering of the buildings this gives a lot of interaction in the game.&#10;&#10;The game can end in 3 ways. The most common is for one of the players the reach the necessary score. What this score is depends on the number of players. The game also ends when three types of buildings run out or a player cannot place a building any more (because his lands are full).&#10;&#10;",

Meanwhile the players' Inuit meeples approach from the edge of the board to hunt the fish and the other animals to score points and to build igloos for territorial reasons.  The game ends when there's no more ice to be melted (all the squares next to open water have an Inuk or an igloo on them), prompting a final scoring based on which players have control of the remaining islands.&#10;&#10;Even in the &quot;gamers' version&quot; (Inuit cannot enter a square with an opposing igloo, scoring is a little different at the end) noted by the authors, the tiles you draw determine, to a large extent, your luck in the game.

Instead of just getting the refreshing drink over the counter, the soda companies have bottled their sensational soft drink. These bottles are showing up in all of the major cities in grocery stores and vending machines. As the owner of a soda pop company, you need to make sure that your product captures the market it deserves in all of the major cities and that it knocks out the competition leaving just one top pop.&#10;&#10;Top Pop is a card game in which players are placing city cards onto the table and stacking bottle caps (which represent the company's influence) onto the played cities on the table. At the start of a player's turn, if their bottle cap is on a higher stack than the other players on a city card, that player collects that city; if not, they continue to try to gain dominance on city cards where they can. Each city comes in two types: day and night. Day city cards are played face-up on the table for all to see. Night city cards are played face down and only the player who played the card and whoever it is in front of can see it. At the end of the game, players earn points for majority control in a city and sets of cities collected.&#10;&#10;In the advanced version of the game, cities also have powers that are earned when a city is collected. A player continues to maintain their power until another player has collected the associated city, at which the power is then transferred.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Second, player must play a card. Player can play cards in three different ways: play any number of a single good, play two cards of different goods or play a special card. After that player passes the turn to another player. When any player plays the thirteenth card in front of them, that player gets the captain card and other player can play one more round.&#10;&#10;After that, the game goes into the profit phase. Players take turns selling their goods and using the special cards, like warehouses or ports.

Desktop HEBOCON Battle Kit, is a Japanese game based on the theme of &quot;HEBOCON&quot;. This is form of 'robot-wars' events, with microbots fighting Sumo matches. One robot must defeat the other according to Sumo wrestling rules, such as pushing them out of the circle, or flipping them to a fall. At HEBOCON events, people construct their own robots and fight knock-out matches to find a winner. HEBOCON is derived from the Japanese word Heboku, meaning 'bad' or 'heavy', something that is childish. HEBOCON is designed for people with little technical ability. This game recreates that experience in a simple build and fight way.&#10;&#10;During the game, players collect tiles and place them in their build area, a 6x6 grid. Gathering tiles and building is how the player programs their robot to fight. Players gain victory points during the Gather and Build stages, and get more VPs through winning fights in the Battle stage. The player with the most points will be the HEBOCON champion!&#10;&#10;In the Gather stage, each player takes turns to take a tile from a large circle of pieces. You move your robot forward, taking a tile from the circle. Each time the last player makes a complete lap, they place a nut on the gameboard to show a lap has been completed. Once each player has made nine circuits and collected a stack of nine tiles, then they start to Build. Whilst collecting tiles, players cannot look at their stack and must use their memory for what they need to build.&#10;&#10;In the Build stage, a player starts a digital timer and everyone has a brief time to assemble their bot. If a player fills out all 36 squares of their grid, they suffer a penalty as their robot is too technical! This reflects the same rules in HEBOCON. Players score points for a solid, connected build, which in HEBOCON is more important than winning a fight.&#10;&#10;Finally the players Battle with their bots, by placing a nut on a tile on their grid. These are the bots actions, such as moving and making turns in the sumo ring. Once combat is finished, the player with the most points overall is the winner.&#10;&#10;As well as all the boards and tiles, the game includes a digital timer and a bunch of metal nuts to mark actions in the game.&#10;&#10;Publisher's summary&#10;&quot;Tabletop Hebocon&rdquo; is themed on HEBOCON, &ldquo;a robot sumo-wrestling competition for those who are not technically gifted&rdquo; . Let&rsquo;s GATHER, BUILD (program), BATTLE and compete for points. Even if a robot doesn&rsquo;t work well, praise its performance with a shout of &ldquo;HEBOI!&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#229;&#141;&#147;&#228;&#184;&#138;&#227;&#131;&#152;&#227;&#131;&#156;&#227;&#130;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#230;&#138;&#128;&#232;&#161;&#147;&#229;&#138;&#155;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#228;&#189;&#142;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#173;&#227;&#131;&#156;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#231;&#155;&#184;&#230;&#146;&#178;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#10;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#227;&#131;&#152;&#227;&#131;&#156;&#227;&#130;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#131;&#134;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#158;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#131;&#156;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#131;&#173;&#227;&#131;&#156;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#181;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#191;&#231;&#171;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#175;&#190;&#230;&#136;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#233;&#171;&#152;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#231;&#130;&#185;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#171;&#182;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#10;&#230;&#128;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#139;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#227;&#131;&#152;&#227;&#131;&#156;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#230;&#157;&#165;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#135;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#230;&#161;&#140;&#228;&#184;&#138;&#229;&#187;&#162;&#230;&#159;&#180;&#230;&#169;&#159;&#230;&#162;&#176;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#230;&#136;&#176;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#230;&#152;&#175;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#230;&#172;&#190;&#228;&#187;&#165;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#229;&#187;&#162;&#230;&#159;&#180;&#230;&#169;&#159;&#230;&#162;&#176;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#230;&#136;&#176; HEBOCON&#227;&#128;&#141;&#228;&#189;&#156;&#228;&#184;&#187;&#233;&#161;&#140;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#230;&#161;&#140;&#233;&#129;&#138;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;HEBOCON &#230;&#152;&#175;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#229;&#128;&#139;&#229;&#176;&#136;&#233;&#150;&#128;&#231;&#181;&#166;&#230;&#178;&#146;&#230;&#156;&#137;&#230;&#138;&#128;&#232;&#161;&#147;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#229;&#163;&#171;&#229;&#143;&#131;&#229;&#138;&#160;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#230;&#169;&#159;&#230;&#162;&#176;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#230;&#175;&#148;&#232;&#179;&#189;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#230;&#136;&#145;&#229;&#128;&#145;&#228;&#190;&#134;&#231;&#181;&#132;&#229;&#144;&#136;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#231;&#183;&#168;&#231;&#168;&#139;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#176;&#141;&#230;&#136;&#176;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#231;&#171;&#159;&#231;&#136;&#173;&#229;&#136;&#134;&#230;&#149;&#184;&#229;&#144;&#167;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#10;&#229;&#141;&#179;&#228;&#189;&#191;&#230;&#169;&#159;&#230;&#162;&#176;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#233;&#129;&#139;&#228;&#189;&#156;&#228;&#184;&#141;&#228;&#189;&#179;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#228;&#185;&#159;&#228;&#190;&#134;&#229;&#143;&#171;&#228;&#187;&#150;&#229;&#128;&#145;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#232;&#129;&#178;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#229;&#187;&#162;&#230;&#159;&#180;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#231;&#168;&#177;&#232;&#174;&#154;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#228;&#184;&#139;&#228;&#187;&#150;&#229;&#128;&#145;&#229;&#144;&#167;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#10;&#10;",

The game is played in three rounds &mdash; Morning News, News at Noon and Evening Edition &mdash; in which the players take turns making up news stories, using elements from the previous rounds, as well as bringing new items in. They have to think on their feet and adapt their news stories to different newscaster roles.&#10;&#10;Each round, the players need to adapt the story elements they are given to the news segment they have been assigned. Being assigned a segment helps players build a starting story and in future rounds causes stories to blend and change in interesting ways.&#10;&#10;The three recursive rounds are at the core of the experience. Seeing the same news item start out as a relatively simple Home and Beauty segment, then in Sportsball a bit more odd and unbelievable, and finally as a Political where the hilarious chaos peaks adds to the zany nature of the recursion.&#10;&#10;",

Working with limited information, players must pool their wits and resources to dismantle live bombs. Dismantling is carried out by finding pairs of code tiles with the same number. Aim to clear the missions without blowing yourselves up. All players share the victory or suffer defeat together. Work as a team towards victory!&#10;&#10;In more detail, the game consists of numbered cards, with four copies each of 1-12 and with stars and bombs having decimal numbers, e.g., 3.1 and 6.5. You receive a hand of cards and place them on a rack facing yourself in numerical order. Standing cards are &quot;armed&quot;, and as cards are disarmed, you lay them sideways and reveal them to others. Some information is revealed initially, and on your turn, you can attempt a pair disarm, a self disarm, or a bomb dismantling.&#10;&#10;For a pair disarm, point to a tile on another player's rack and declare what number or star it is. If you're correct and you have the matching item, both of them are disarmed. For a self disarm, you can reveal pairs of matching cards on your own rack if you know no other player has any. If all numbers and stars have been removed from your rack, you can then dismantle one bomb on your rack.)&#10;&#10;What's more, you and your fellow professional bomb disposal specialists can work through a sequence of fifty missions, which are listed in a separate scenario book. If you wish, you can also just pick and play specific missions that you like. You won't be able to complete everything in one sitting, so gather your friends and meet up over multiple play sessions. The missions start off easy, but steadily grow harder.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The objective of the game is to have more tile of your color face up when all the tiles are placed.&#10;&#10;To setup the game place the home tile at the center of the table. This tile has no arrows. From now on no tiles can be placed further than 3 spaces away from this tile (this creates a 7 by 7 grid when finished).&#10;&#10;Players then take alternate turns. On your turn you must choose a tile that is still available and place it on an empty space - up, down, left or right of a tile already placed.&#10;&#10;You must place it in any of the 8 possible orientations you wish. The orientation of a tile is indicated by the white arrow in the middle.&#10;&#10;Once a tile is placed, check whether it can convert an opponent's tile over to your side - to do so you must fulfill three conditions;&#10;&#10;1) your tile must have your color arrow pointing toward your opponent's tile&#10;2) the target opponent tile must not have their color arrow pointing back&#10;3) the two tiles must not share the same orientation&#10;&#10;If multiple tiles can be converted at the same time you may only choose one.&#10;&#10;The converted tile is flipped over to your side and rotated to the same orientation as one that converted it. You then treat that tile as though it just been placed and check if another conversion can be made. Repeat this process until no further conversion is possible.&#10;&#10;Now it is your opponent's turn.&#10;&#10;Players will take turn placing and converting tiles back and forth in this manner until all the tiles are placed and the game is over. Count up the total number of tiles for each player; whoever has the most of their color facing up is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Welcome to the best FTF fantasy baseball board game ever created. This baseball game is for people who like meat and potatoes with a side of greens. It is the whole enchilada. When playing it you will use your intuition or feel to pick up patterns leading to decisions to outwit your opponent. If you can deal with, &quot;Take that!&quot;, you will like this game. Baseball Strategy is not meant for the shy, but the hearty. Great baseball action. Thrilling too! Never a dull moment and you will actually feel like a batter or a pitcher, manager or a base coach, etc. when you play this game.  Then you can live out your fantasies of being a big-league ball player! At least that's the idea is promoting here and what's wrong with that? Let's face it. Even if you just played wiffle ball in your backyard, haven't you fantasied hitting one into the upper deck at Tiger Stadium, especially having seen a slugger do that many times in your life? It would be nice to hear the cheers as you formally rounded the bases with alacrity to score. Baseball Strategy seems to capture the psychological battle between pitcher and batter quite well. Experience the excitement of getting a bases loaded, bases clearing double when you anticipated the pitch correctly, but you will also experience the agony when you don't! This game is unlike any other baseball game this author has ever played. There are rules for series play in order to give proper rest to pitchers where the entire pitching staff is used and not just the &quot;Aces&quot;.  Series play is highly recommended to have a full &quot;baseball fantasy&quot; playing experience. The game now even has variant injury possibilities, video replay challenges, robs of hit opportunities, MLB Defensive &quot;Leather Larceny&quot; Highlight Plays, setting the infield at DP depth and more.&#10;This fantasy is a cat and mouse game (and vice versa) hiding in plain sight where the two gamers enter a complex matrix of double blind decisions that lead to the inevitable think and counter-think, out witting duel.  Gamers begin by first selecting their lineups from imaginary players or actual players by converting their stats to the game's parameters. (This is easily done from mlb.com on the net or baseball-reference.com.).  If you don&rsquo;t like agony, this game isn&rsquo;t for you!&#10;Enter The Matrix: The Defensive team is the manager and catcher, selecting pitch types (Fast Ball, Off Speed, Pitch out, etc.) to send batters fuming back to the dugout, sometimes with specific outs in a certain situation. Batters attempt to get a hit, get on base or at the least make an out that moves runners into scoring position/ or of course, scoring. (that's the idea, right?) Each tries to anticipate the other's tendencies throughout the game in order to &quot;exploit&quot; them.&#10;After a pitch card is played by the pitcher, the batter must then select a type of offense/ball in play strategy (Steal, Bunt, Hit and Run, Long Ball, etc.)The results of the two choices are found by cross indexing them on a result matrix table. Players can decide on the size of ballpark before the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "In this mini-series tie-in card game, 3-7 players in the basic game and 3-8 players in the advanced game try to score points by collecting cards not unlike in traditional card games. The artwork features characters from the movie &quot;Shogun&quot;, and the game can be played in a simple (beginner) or an advanced version, which makes use of all the cards.&#10;&#10;There are two &quot;colors&quot; of cards, peasants and samurai, which are organized into several subclasses like Farmer, Servant, Samurai Wife, or Hatamoto, which all have different point values. Basically, you try to score points by getting either a complete hand of one color (but no doubles), or several cards of the same type. Furthermore, there are wild cards like the Priest, the Emperor, the Heir and of course the Shogun which all have special values in certain combinations. Several other cards like a joker (the &quot;Buddha&quot;) or an elimination card (the &quot;Ninja&quot;) are also part of the deck. Unlike many other card games, you don't hold the cards in your hand; four of your five cards are displayed face up in front of you, while the fifth lies face down to be kept secret till the end of the turn. This makes bluffing as important a factor as luck and strategy in this game.&#10;&#10;But that's not all. Right before the end (and before revealing their face-down card), players can choose a final strategy, represented by small strategy markers. &quot;Passive&quot; means you get the points your hand is worth (if any), while &quot;Power Play&quot; can double your score (or even turn a zero point hand into 20 points), but only if either you're the only one to play &quot;Power Play&quot;, or if you're the player with the highest score this round. For every other &quot;Power Player&quot; there's a hefty point penalty.&#10;&#10;There are even more special cards that I won't go into detail about (such as the &quot;Spy&quot; or the &quot;Hostage&quot;), as well as an intricate turn sequence that allows players to play their cards almost simultaneously. Also, the deck is only reshuffled when all the cards have been used up, which may take a few rounds and will make sure that certain powerful cards only show up ever so often, and not always in the right order to be played.&#10;&#10;Another noteworthy part of this game is it's unique atmosphere. The rules successfully impose a courteous oriental gameplay where cards aren't simply dealt, but offered, and where Favors can be used to influence a hand. At the same time, there's always the shadow of the Ninja looming over the table, and even though it rarely strikes, it can re-arrange the whole score sheet.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player has reached 500 points (or 1,000 points for &quot;epic games&quot;). A regular game lasts about 45 minutes.&#10;&#10;",

Each disciple also has a skill level, shown by a belt: white, yellow, green, blue or black.&#10;&#10;During each round, one player is the dealer. Each round consists of three phases: Recruitment, Challenge and Training.&#10;&#10;During the recruitment phase, the dealer draws a card, looks at it, and gives it face-down to a player. He repeats this process until each player has been dealt a card.&#10;&#10;During the challenge phase, the dealer may be challenged. The player to his left gets the first chance to challenge. If he does not challenge, the next player gets a chance, etcetera, until the dealer is challenged or all players have declined the opportunity to challenge.&#10;&#10;If there is a challenge, both players involved (the dealer and the challenger) show their card. The card with the highest value belt wins the challenge (with ties going to the challenger). The winner gains a trophy and may exchange his card with the loser&rsquo;s card, if he so desires.&#10;&#10;During the training phase, each player adds his card to his dojo. During the first round, the card is simply placed on the table; during later rounds, new cards must be added adjacent to an earlier card. The end result should be a 3x4 grid. A player who has won a trophy must place that trophy next to a column or row.&#10;&#10;After twelve rounds, the game ends, and players score points. For each row, players score points for the biggest group of cards of the same type. For each column, players score points if each card shows the same colour belt. Trophies modify the scoring of a row or column.&#10;&#10;",

At the start of a round, each player gets a hand of five cards, places one of them face down on their longship, passes the cards left, chooses another card, etc. until they have five cards on their longship.&#10;&#10;They then take these cards in hand, and everyone simultaneously chooses a card and places it face down on the table. You're using these animals to win treasure chests, which also come in blue, yellow, and red. The chests are shuffled and placed in two piles. You play your card by a face-up chest, then everyone reveals their card:&#10;&#10;&#10;    If your animal doesn't match the color of the chest, remove it from play.&#10;    If only one animal is by a chest, that player's owner claims it.&#10;    If multiple animals are by a chest, whoever played the highest number wins the chest.&#10;&#10;&#10;Continue to play until you've played all five cards. If any chests remain, shuffle the animal cards and play another round. Once all the chests have been claimed, turn over the chest cards and count the coins on them to see who has the biggest treasure haul!&#10;&#10;The game includes three animal chiefs that have a value of 0, but a unique special ability that can possibly win you a chest you wouldn't have got otherwise. Shuffle them into the animal deck for an additional challenge.&#10;&#10;",

All this is possible with the abstract wargame--Battle Leader Tactics (BLT).&quot;&#10;&#10;BLT is a component and introductory game for the Battles Leaders Tactics &amp; Technology (BLTT) master game.  BLTT is an abstract wargame that depicts some of the greatest military leaders (e.g., Alexander, Napoleon, Caesar, etc.) commanding historical units in some of the world most decisive battles (e.g., Megiddo, Zama, Hastings, Waterloo, etc.) using proven tactics of history.  BLT serves as a basic game introducing players to the interaction between army units, leaders and tactics.  BLT allows players to command standard troops (e.g, infantry, cavalry, artillery and guard) and special military units (e.g., 300 Spartans, Panzer Army Afrika, etc.) with historic military leaders using real tactics and fog of war--all without any dice.

Leave a minute so that everyone can think of one, because the ESPOS will have to invent it and the BRILLIANT, if there is one, will have to memorize the correct one to say it when his turn comes.&#10;If it's your turn to be ORATE, come up with a credible definition, remember that your goal is to trick the starting player into choosing yours and thus score points.&#10;When the players have presented their definitions, the SAPIENTE will have to choose the one they think is correct or declare that they are all crazy and none of them are real.&#10;&#10;     If the SAPIENTE gets it right, the word card will be kept as a prize.&#10;     If he fails, the player whose definition he has chosen keeps the card.&#10;     If it fails and had indicated that everyone is crazy, the card is left under the deck.&#10;&#10;&#10;Return the category tokens to the center of the table and give all the cards to the new BUDDY, who will be the player to the left of the current one.

The system does not deal with the tactical formations of the period, instead it highlights the command systems and capacities, the fog of war, and the consequent operational and strategic decisions, keeping the game complexity at middle to low level.&#239;&#187;&#191;&#10;&#10;Historical Note:&#10;Custoza is a small town at the edge of low hills between Verona and the Mincio river, an area that always saw the passage, and the fighting, of armies struggling for the domain of Veneto. And the same hills were the theater of two fierce battles between the rising Italian Kingdom and the Austrian Empire.&#10;&#10;In July 1848, the battle between the Piedmomtese Army under King Carlo Alberto and the Austrian Imperial Army under Field Marshall Joseph Radetzky signed the turning point of the First Independence War, and the defeat of the Piedmontese dream of an Italian Crusade against Austria.&#10;&#10;In 1866, on 24th of June (the recurrence of the Battle of Solferino), a far bigger, but inconclusive, battle was fought between the new Italian Kingdom Army under Vittorio Emanuele II, son of Carlo Alberto, and the Austrian Imperial Army of South led by Archduke Albrecht. The battle started as a meeting engagement, ending in a massive fighting. It  was a crushing defeat of the Italian colours, but the Third Independence War still finally gave Veneto to the Kingdom of Italy, because of its alliance with Prussia, who was winning the Austro-Prussian War of 1866.&#10;&#10;&#239;&#187;&#191;&#239;&#187;&#191;&#10;&#10;",

In Pumpkin Patch: Bad Seeds, players will compete to harvest seeds from burgeoning pumpkin patch filled with ugly, scary, and horrifically creepy pumpkins.&#10;&#10;Pumpkin Patch: Bad Seeds is a game of pumpkin planting, crow scaring, and tile laying for 1-3 players. Each round, players must choose which type of pumpkin to plant in order to help grow the budding pumpkin patch. Each pumpkin planted grants the players victory seeds. The goal of the game is to collect as many seeds as possible before the final pumpkin is planted. Players will use Baby Boos, Blazes, and Warty Goblins to collect seeds and thwart their opponents efforts to do the same!&#10;&#10;How to Play:&#10;In Pumpkin Patch, players take turns planting pumpkins in a race to collect pumpkin seeds! There are three stages to each turn:&#10;&#10;1. Play a card from your hand or the compost to collect seeds.&#10;2. Move a crow to block other players.&#10;3. Discard any number of cards. Refill your hand.&#10;&#10;Once the largest pumpkin in the patch has been planted, your ghastly garden is complete!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
