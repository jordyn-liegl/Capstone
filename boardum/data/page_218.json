    "description": "The Xuanwu (pronounced &quot;shuan-woo&quot;) Gate Incident refers to an actual Chinese palace coup for the throne in the year 626 at the height of the Tang Dynasty. Li Shimin, the second son of Emperor Gaozu, planned an ambush at Xuanmu Gate leading to the Palace City and assassinated two of his brothers who were in a fierce competition with him for the throne. A few days after this coup, Li Shimin was made the crown prince. His father abdicated two months later, and Li Shimin became Emperor Taizong.&#10;&#10;The Xuanwu Gate Incident is a secret identity deduction game. Each player is dealt a character card that is secret to other players. On a player's turn, they may examine one of the two cards placed facedown in the center of the table. They may choose to swap the card with their own card, or with any other players' card, or keep it where it is. After all players have had a chance to examine one card, there will be voting to determine whether the current round comes to a showdown; if so, all cards are revealed and the winning team is determined.&#10;&#10;",

The basis of the game is simple but highly effective: 42 Animal cards (21 pairs) and 4 Hunter cards are dealt out among the players. Each player then takes his cards into his hand without showing them to anyone else. Each player chooses a card and plays it face-down in front of himself. He then tries to mimic the cry of the animal on the card he has chosen, with the objective of finding its mate.&#10;&#10;As soon as two players think they share the same animal, the both knock the center of the table. This action suspends the game while the players check to see if they were correct. If they were, they are awarded their respective cards.&#10;&#10;At any time, a player who can't find his mate may take his card back into his hand and play out another, henceforth imitating the cry of the new card's animal instead.&#10;&#10;Players have to watch out for the Hunters, which let one imitate an animal's call...&#10;&#10;A game of hilarious cacophony for players 7 and up and which has an impressive variant intended for 42 players.&#10;&#10;",

The 1 card is called the Patrol Leader. The player to the dealer's left starts by playing any card between 1 and 10 from his hand to the center of the table. The next player must either play a card from the same Patrol whose number is 1 greater or 1 less than the card on the table, or play a card from a different Patrol whose number is the same. For example, if an Owl 4 card is led, the next player may play an Owl 3 below it, an Owl 5 above it, or a 4 card from a different patrol (say a Wolf 4) adjacent to it (thus allowing Wolf cards to be played). The lead card designates the number that all other patrols must start on (in this example number 4). If a player has no legal play he must pass. The first player to play his last card scores points equal to the numbers on all the cards still in the other players hands. A Patrol Leader card counts as 15 points for scoring.

    "description": "Guests arrive at a mansion for what they hope will be a relaxing weekend, but alas the calm of Friday night is broken when a cry of fright rings out. The guests wake up and gather only to be horrified with the discovery of the lifeless body of one of them. Who could have killed him? And more importantly, who will be the next victim?&#10;&#10;Fatal Rendez Vous plays a bit like Werewolf, with most players belonging to one group while one or more of them secretly work against the group. Each player receives a role card at the start of play. Each night in the game, while everyone has their eyes closed, one of the secret assassins taps another player on the shoulder; this player counts to ten, then dies. Day comes, and everyone runs around in a tizzy &mdash; specifically turning in circles three times &mdash; during which time the other assassin winks at someone, killing that person as well.&#10;&#10;The guests handcuff two players during the day, and those two players take no actions for the next day. This pattern continues until three days pass. If the assassins have been handcuffed together during the weekend, then the other guests win, having captured the evildoers; if not, however, the assassins claim the victory.&#10;&#10;Fatal Rendez Vous includes special role cards that mix up play, for example, with a player who becomes a vampire after death, taking out the assassin and murdering people on his own. Another player might have a weak heart and perish after only five seconds, giving the assassin less time to find cover.&#10;&#10;&#10;From TricTrac:&#10;&#10;Le D&eacute;fifoo Noir (subtitled Friday the 13th at the Castle) is a game inspired by Cluedo and Agatha Christie&rsquo;s 12 Little Indians and is another game in the lineage of Werewolf. It is designed by Olivier Finet, principal designer at D&eacute;fifoo SA. The game can accommodate 5 to 20 players and play time is estimated at 30 minutes.&#10;&#10;Players are given a special role representing either an innocent guest at the castle or a sinister murderer. The players are invited to investigate the murders and hopefully throw the right suspect(s) in prison. In this game however, people are free to move around during the day phases and interact freely with one another, thereby using all of their senses to nab their victims/assailants. These negotiation phases however are timed and last only 3 minutes. Making things harder on the poor guests, the murders happen both at night and during the day over a maximum of 5 turns. The game components include the role cards, a pair of handcuffs (for the culprits), a timer and a bowtie for the Castle&rsquo;s host (game overseer).&#10;&#10;",

One player is sent on one of these missions, but doesn't know which one whereas everyone else does know. This ignorant person has two stacks of item cards in front of them and starts the round by picking one of the two top items, showing it to the first player in clockwise order, and asking whether they will need the item for the mission. The other player may answer only &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;, but can stress the words in any way they like.&#10;&#10;Then the ignorant person picks another item and shows it to the next player, and so on. When the ignorant person has collected four &quot;yes&quot; cards, they have to guess what their mission is. If the guess is correct, the next round is played with an additional mission card, up to a maximum of five missions in play at one time. If the players can tell a good story about how to use the item, they get an extra point.&#10;&#10;All &quot;no&quot; cards go as points to MacGivrette. If an ignorant person guesses the wrong mission, MacGivrette also gets the mission cards as a bonus (and the number of mission cards goes down by one). If any player answers anything else other than &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;, MacGivrette gets that item card as well.&#10;&#10;When the group has solved a round with five mission cards, the game ends and they count their cards. If they have gathered more cards than MacGivrette, they win!&#10;&#10;",

The French player must consolidate her polyglot army and its inspiring leader, while dealing with Joan's &quot;voices&quot; via an events table that leaves him feeling slightly out of control.  The English player has to deal with Scots and herrings and trying to resist the &quot;help&quot; of an unwanted Burgundian ally.  Both players face the challenges of making siege and open-field combat work for them, in an era where artillery and charges by armored knights belong on the same battlefield. The game includes 200 counters, a full-color, mounted mapboard, and all the charts you will need to keep your focus on the Maid.&#10;&#10;Joan of Arc's Victory also includes a random &quot;Joan Events&quot; table that will render the French player a sense of the uncertainty being around someone divinely inspired might provide. And it keeps life interesting for the English too, as Joan may do something very unexpected (and have surprising combat benefits too!).&#10;&#10;No two games will ever be alike.&#10;&#10;Part of the TPS &quot;Decisive Battles&quot; series&#10;That means straightforward rules, key insights into the history behind the game, and designs aimed at one-session conclusions and high replay value.&#10;&#10;",

He awakes from the darkness of the ruins to fulfill his mission, to chase all intruders and throw them out with a curse!&#10;&#10;In Pyramid Raiders, players lay down action tiles to move and collect treasure tokens on a hexagonal map. Besides providing a number for movement, action tiles will also effect The Guardian in different ways, such as rotate him to face another direction or make him move faster. Used action tiles will stay on board, and will be returned to hand only every five turns when they are all used.&#10;&#10;The Guardian's movement is guided by a set of rules and does not need a player to act as the GM. Each turn after all players have finished their moves, roll a die to move The Guardian, then move it extra spaces depending on the action tiles played this turn.&#10;&#10;At the start of each game, randomly place 49 treasure tokens of seven kinds on the map. Players score by collecting tokens of different colors, or by specializing in only one or two colors. Twelve wooden tokens are placed on the map as obstacles, and can be placed in different layouts to change the difficulty of the game. Ten item tiles are included to provide rule-bending effects for players. And for those who are up for the challenge, two extra Line of Sight tokens will let The Guardian literally grow eyes on his back, making it even harder to escape &ndash; or easier to trap other players depending on your point of view...&#10;&#10;",

The game has a simple but refined mechanism able to represent the 24 seconds action in 3 shot-clock turns. Players move on the court, mark, dribble, block, pass, score for 2 or 3 points as in the real and amazing NBA matches! Time is running, the opponents are 2 points short and have the ball; a few seconds to the end, the public is shouting: &quot;defense-defense&quot; it is not only a game, it is really happening! GAME FOR FANS AND PEOPLE INTERESTED IN KNOWING A BIT MORE ON BASKETBALL.&#10;&#10;HOW TO PLAY: the miniatures are moved accordingly to the result of a red 6-sided die (for the ball's owner) and a green 6-sided die (for the remaining 4 miniatures). After any unit movement the defending team can reply with a unit movement trying to mark. All the miniatures have values of speed and passing capabilities, and also 2-points and 3-points percentages values. Therefore players can manage the game as a real NBA game, trying to have the best player in the best shooting position for scoring. When a miniatures decides to shoot a 12-sided die is rolled and the result is eventually diminished by one if the miniature is marked. If the result is equal or lower than the miniature's shooting ability then there is a score.&#10;Situations like blocks, dunks, stealing the ball, illegal defenses, screening, free throws and faults add to the game a high likelihood. Special cards for special actions are present.&#10;&#10;",

The game begins with the American invasion of that island and includes the subsequent Japanese attempts to retake it. The game is intended to be a simulation of combined air-naval-ground operations, or what are today called &quot;joint operations&quot;. Consequently it centers on modeling command and staff systems, focusing on the difficulties and advantages inherent in sequenced interactions between and among air, naval and ground forces.&#10;&#10;",

The first encounters between them did not go peacefully. During centuries, war and conflicts expanded affecting almost every corner in the galaxy.&#10;&#10;During the longest part of the galactic history, different species used to settle on the systems they arrived to. Instead of just exploring the galaxy, they were sending their overpopulation to colonize new homes. That caused many wars, because it&rsquo;s not easy to share your home planet with a foreign species who has nothing in common with you. But everything changed when The Plague arrived.&#10;&#10;The Plague was an illness that affected all intelligent species all across the galaxy, decimating their population to the brink of extinction and ending wars.&#10;&#10;Survivors of each species regrouped as well as they could and, following severe isolation protocols, finally the Plague was almost eradicated although their customs changed forever.&#10;&#10;Since that day on, all species are nomads, because the void of space is the most aseptic environment, and they no longer settle on the systems they visit. The biggest part of the population stays on the surface of a planet the necessary time to get their  esources and nothing more.&#10;&#10;Space Opera  is a card game for ages above 14. 2 to 4 players. Approximate duration of the game: between 30 and 90 minutes, depending on the number of players. Each player, represents an specie, fighting to achieve supremacy on the Galaxy (through the Extermination the other species or reaching Civilization Level 3 or more).&#10;&#10;The game could be played with using all the same deck or could be played in a Competitive Mode. In Competitive Mode, every player have their own deck with the specie and 40 resources cards previously chosen.&#10;&#10;",

Open the throwback boombox, flip open the cassette player gameboard, and split into two teams.&#10;&#10;First, go head-to-head in the Quick-Fire Buzzer Round. One player from each team tries to think of a song to fit the description on the Head-to-Head category card (e.g. &ldquo;Pop Anthems&rdquo;) before the 15-second timer runs out, hitting the buzzer to throw the mic back to their opponent. The first person to run out of time loses this round.&#10;&#10;In the Artist Round, get ready to belt it out! Each player gets three Artist Cards and has 30 seconds to get their team to guess all the artists using one of three methods&mdash; using just one word; speaking the lyrics; or performing one of the artist&rsquo;s songs. When a team gets one right, they add the card to their collection. The first team to grab a card from all eight categories wins and has the right to party like it&rsquo;s 1999!&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

Because of the tactical scale of Grenadier some of the battles are represented by crucial segments, isolated and simulated. For example the Battle of Waterloo (1815) is represented by the attack of Napoleon's Old Guard on the center of the British line, The Battle of the Pyramids (1798) by the attack of the Marmeluke cavalry on the most exposed French infantry. Several other battles such as Palo Alto (1846) from the Mexican War are covered entirely. Commanders represented include Marlborough, Frederick the Great, Napoleon, Ney, Wellington, and Zachary Taylor. Some of the 16 battles depicted in Grenadier are Blenheim, Austerlitz, Marengo and Jena. Attacks are divided into fire (musket and cannon) and shock (bayonet and saber) modes. There are nine types of infantry units, three cavalry and five artillery. Grenadiers combat resolution systems depends less on chance (die rolls) than any game then yet developed.&#10;&#10;",

Throughout November the Confederate commander, Braxton Bragg, had misinterpreted that pursuit as an effort to capture Chattanooga; so now he halted and deployed his troops northwest of Murfreesboro, Tennessee, so as to safeguard the road junction there. Thus the Confederates sat and awaited their pursuers for a month. When the Federal army arrived in late December 1862, the Confederates launched a surprise attack near Stones River.&#10;&#10;Stones River utilizes the all-new Musket &amp; Saber Combat System, which presents a simple yet accurate portrayal of warfare during the American Civil War. The combat system is intuitive, including all the details that characterized battle during the Civil War while also simulating the unique aspects of 19th century warfare. Units can become weakened and rout; attackers can pursue, and the fortunes of war can intervene at any time. Cavalry can rip open enemy lines and shred fleeing units, and reserves must be ready to plug holes or secure a line of retreat.&#10;&#10;In Stones River a new Combat Results Table emphasizes playability while also simulating the lethality of the rifled musket. Leaders accelerate the action, replicating the importance of their presence during battle, and supply lines require players to protect their logistical trains. Winning a battle will depend on deployment, maneuver and massing firepower, as well as the strengths and weaknesses of each particular army.&#10;&#10;",

He places it in front of him turned and leaves the used token on it being unused. He will play with one less chip.&#10;If other players 'tokens are found on the card to be lifted, they return to their owners' reserve.&#10;&#10;GAME OVER:&#10;The first player to get 3 cards in their possession wins the game.&#10;&#10;ADVANCED VERSION&#10;It is played the same as the base game but the 4 effect cards are mixed, the first 2 are taken and placed on the table. The remaining 2 are removed from the game.&#10;&#10;These letters have actions. Some are executed immediately and others on the next turn of whoever chose it. A player achieves an effect when one of his pieces is placed in the middle position of a card with its numerical value in white.&#10;&#10;At that time you can select one of the 2 visible effects. Then that card must turn it over and the effect of its reverse will be the one that can be chosen in the future.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Bwahahahahahahahaha!&#10;&#10;In IGOR, players scramble to build devices, but are hampered both by the machinations of other players and their incompetent assistant IGOR. IGOR is represented by a special die, and will do something random for his Scientist every round. The first player to build ten victory points worth of devices, wins!&#10;&#10;Unlike Interactivities Ink's previous games, IGOR is a complete boxed game, with full color playing card stock cards, not photocopied index card stock.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "The game of Alquerque is played on a special board of 5 x 5 points with lines between them to indicate allowed moves.  To draw a board is easy.  First draw a 5 x 5 orthogonal grid.  The draw two diagonal lines - from each corner to the opposite corner.  Finally draw four diagonal lines in the form of a square that connects the midpoints of each side.&#10;Alquerque is played with 12 black pieces and 12 white pieces in a similar way to Draughts (Checkers).  &#10;The player playing black pieces places them on the 10 points of the nearest 2 rows plus the 2 rightmost points on the middle row as the player looks at it.  The other player sets the white pieces up in exactly the same way.  This leaves only the middle point without a piece upon it. The objective of the game is to take all of the opponent's pieces or to produce a position such that the opponent is unable to move.&#10;&#10;Play&#10;Players take turns to move one of their pieces.  A piece may only move along the lines inscribed upon the board.  For each turn a piece makes either a capturing move or an ordinary move.&#10;Whenever a piece has an opponent's piece adjacent to it and the point immediately beyond the opponent's piece is vacant, the opponent's piece can be captured.  A piece is taken by simply hopping over it into the vacant point beyond and removing it from the board.  Unlike an ordinary move, a capturing move can consist of several such hops - if a piece takes an opponent's piece and the new position allows it to take another piece, then it can do so straight away.  The move finishes when the position of the capturing piece no longer allows it to taken any more pieces or the player could make another capture but decides not to.&#10;&#10;An ordinary move is made by simply moving a piece along a line to an adjacent point.&#10;Finishing&#10;The game is won by the player who first manages to take all his opponent's pieces or by the player who has more pieces when it becomes apparent that no more pieces will be taken.   Alternatively, a player can win by rendering the other player unable to move. &#10;A draw occurs by agreement at any point during the game.  If it becomes apparent that no more pieces will be taken and both players have the same number of pieces left, a draw is agreed.  Draws are very common.&#10;&#10;Arie van der Stoep's reconstruction:&#10;&#10;In his book Draughts in relation to chess and alquerque (2005) Arie van der Stoep contends that Alquerque de doze was in medieval times played by the following rules. Counters can move and capture, by the short leap, forwards and sideways. Capture is not compulsory. Counters are promoted to Sultans at the last rank. The Sultan (King) moves and captures in all directions. Counters are obliged to follow the pattern on the board. Goal is to capture all the opponent's counters.&#10;&#10;There existed two variants of Medieval Alquerque. In one version the Sultan can only move one square (short Sultan), and captures by the short leap. This was foremostly played in countries within the Roman sphere of influence. In the other variant the Sultan moves any number of squares, and captures like the King in international draughts, landing anywhere behind the captured piece. This was foremostly played in countries within the Arabic sphere of influence. In Sultan endgames, a majority of at least two Sultans is necessary for a win.&#10;&#10;",

In this chaotic universe, each player is a young star trying to control the galaxy where they live, and prevent the other players from seizing power. Why on earth would you dream of controlling the chaos and fighting against other stars? Well, to become the brightest and the most powerful star of the galaxy! Do not miss your chance, show the other stars how badass you are!&#10;&#10;Playing the Game: To start playing Entropia, deal three cards to each player and place the deck on the centre. One of the players goes first and the game starts. During your turn, you can choose and perform only one action, which can consist in drawing a card from the deck or playing one of your cards, then the turn passes to the next player in rotation.&#10;&#10;All cards in the deck stand for a planet and you can use them to perform different actions: for example, you can use your card to attract planets with your gravity by putting the card on the board in front of you (using the keyword Attract), you can convert the mass of a planet into pure energy (using the keyword Fuse) in order to draw new cards from the deck, play an extra card during your turn or scupper the strategies of the other players by destroying their planets. Moreover, you can also discard your cards when your planets have the same mass of your adversary&rsquo;s planets (using the keyword Annihilate) in order to stop other players heading all the way to the winning.&#10;&#10;Since the first person to control four planets wins the game, every player should develop unique strategies to destroy other players&rsquo; cards and conquer the four planets as fast as she/he can. Even though the game looks simple and easy to play at first glance, you will need to devise strategies to control overpowered cards and use them wisely. It&rsquo;s up to you whether you want to greedily take over all the four planets or slowly destroy your enemies&rsquo; resources: there are more methods and strategies you can use to win over the other players, so come and discover them while playing. You need to sharpen your weapons and grit your teeth to be the next champion of Entropia!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

You can also win by collecting 3 Buddha Llamas, but this can be reduced to 2 with the right combination of cards.&#10;&#10;Gameplay involves tactical scheming through the use of various card types: Action, Magic, and Collectibles, and drawing a card from the deck ends your go.&#10;&#10;It&rsquo;s essentially the luck of the draw, but you must devise strategies, use your wit, and play combinations of cards to battle against other players, in an attempt to force them to remove their valuable cards and lose the round.&#10;&#10;There are other dangers lurking within the deck too, as drawing certain cards can mean instant death. However, there are ways to deflect this and Llamasters offers its players several routes back towards victory even when you&rsquo;re on the brink of giving up.&#10;&#10;One of the unique points of the game is the use of augmented reality, which if used, can allow players to re-enter a round they have already been knocked out of. The augmented reality app also includes enchanting animations to complement the gameplay.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Centuries ago a desert land existed in the world of the Eternal Kingdom. The land was rich from its many trade routes and populated by a nation called the People of the Book. Wise rulers had always reigned over them, and thanks to this everyone lived in prosperity. Even so, some had rebelled against the binding order, ignoring the venerable customs and breaking the law...&#10;&#10;You are one of those renegades and &quot;enemies of the kingdom&quot;, but you now have a second chance for freedom as this land's ruler prophesized that among you there is a chosen one who in the future will affect the fate of the desert lands. He decided that a trial in an ancient labyrinth would resolve who would be released and who would see daylight no more. The corridors of the labyrinth are winding and bristle with cleverly planned and dangerous pitfalls. Tales and legends also mention a guard, an immortal Golem that tramps the stone corridors.&#10;&#10;Labyrinth: The Paths of Destiny 2 ed. is an adventure board game for 2-6 players who impersonate both the great constructors of the ancient labyrinth and the daredevils who try to escape.&#10;&#10;To find a way out of the labyrinth, each player must find a special key while avoiding traps from other players, not to mention the Golem. With their two actions each turn, players can construct the multi-level labyrinth, set traps, move, rest, attack other players and much more.&#10;&#10;",

You may add one of your lumberjack tiles next to the tiles already placed on the table, following the rules.&#10;&#10;3.

    "description": "An LPS bonus mini-game for two-players, Desert Duel, by designer Mike Rinella, looks at the first battle of Alamein in 1942, where modern armies fought each other and the desert, in a desperate effort to breakthrough to or defend the path to the Nile.  This is not the Monty vs. Rommel El Alamein battle most people think of but an earlier action, July 1 to July 27, 1942. Each turn represents three days of combat, and each hex is about four miles across.&#10;&#10;Where 2nd El Alamein reminded many of WW1 type conflict, this first battle was pure open desert warfare, of the guy that both sides were developing on the fly, and Rinella&rsquo;s design captures the feel of the grit and gloom.&#10;&#10;Low density counter mix, ratio combat results table, supply, leaders, weather, air support, recon screening units, minefields and a special 88 Flak unit make for an interesting mix of mechanics.&#10;&#10;Desert Duel comes with 88 large 5/8&quot; mounted die-cut counters, and an integrated 17&quot; x 22&quot; full color map with rules and charts.&#10;&#10;This game was included as a bonus game for subscribers with Against the Odds (ATO) magazine #21 (the Kadesh issue).&#10;&#10;",
