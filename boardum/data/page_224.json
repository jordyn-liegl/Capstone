No dice are involved. The only random element of the game is the decision at the beginning of each phase which player goes first. The player with the highest number of territories at the end of the game, is the winner.&#10;&#10;It takes about 5 minutes to explain the rules.

The map is a point-to-point map, using city-states and the common land and navigable sea routes as the conduits that defined the Grecian Mediterranean. The game is designed for simple movement and combat mechanics to resolve battles and sieges, all centered upon the predominance of famous and historic leaders (e.g., Alcibiades). The game is richly historic, and keeps players within historic parameters in such a way that alliances and politics can shift, depending on how the war is going, but only within the limits of historic possibilities. Some city-states of the Delos Confederation may ally with Athens, while others may ally with Sparta, for example. Athens vs Sparta includes four scenarios: The Archidamian War (431 - 422), The Peace of Nicias and the Sicilian Expedition (421 &ndash; 413), The Ionian War (412 &ndash; 404), and the campaign scenario covering the entire war.&#10;&#10;The game includes one 22x34&quot; map of the Grecian Mediterranean, including Sicily and southern Italy, and as far east as the Persian empire, 280 counters of all participants in the Peloponnesian War. Each game turn is played as four seasons of one year. Each inch equals ~18 miles. One naval strength point represents 5 galleys of the era (Triremes), and one land strength point represents 350 to 450 heavy infantry (Hoplites) or 500 to 600 light infantry or 200 to 300 cavalry.&#10;&#10;Components: One 22&quot; x 34&quot; map &amp; 280 counters.&#10;&#10;",

And, security must work together to spot the fake using clues in the subtle size differences in the diamonds. But be careful! There are also burglars hiding among the security. Don't let them fool you in the discussion...!&#10;&#10;The Diamond Swap combines trying to spot the difference and tricking your opponents. All 30 diamond chips are slightly different in size. In this identity-concealing type game, you are divided into two groups: the burglars whose mission is to deceive, and security, who needs to see through the subtle size changes after the diamond swap.&#10;&#10;The player who draws the &quot;burglar&quot; card steals one of the five authentic diamonds in the center and secretly replaces it with a fake from their hand. All within the time the security guards are counting to 10 with their eyes closed. After everyone has opened their eyes, as a group, everyone has to deduce which diamond has been swapped. Though, the differences in sizes are hard to distinguish.&#10;&#10;In the midst of all this guesswork, the burglar tries to deceive the security guards and lead them astray. Sometimes the burglar isn&rsquo;t alone, and has partners in crime to help with to disrupting deductions. Can security avoid being deceived by the burglars and reveal the diamond that&rsquo;s been swapped?&#10;&#10;",

You get one victory point in exchange for five bananas. Once a player has collected five victory points, they win the game. &#10;     The player collects symbols. Each character card shows a certain combination of three symbols (stone / water / coconut) located at the top of their character card. A player wins as soon as they have collected their three symbols. These symbols are activated by playing coresponding action cards. &#10;&#10;&#10;So if you are the first to collect five victory points or the three matching symbols on your character card, you win the game.&#10;&#10;How to Play &#10;Phase 1: Draw a reward card &#10;The player who monkeys around the most begins. They draw any one reward card in the display in Phase 1 of which they see only the front side. However, they receive the reward on the front and the previously hidden back side of the reward card. The drawn reward card then must laid on the discard pile.&#10;&#10;Phase 2:&#10;In Phase 2 the Player can choose between the following options: Activate action card, play an effect, disable action card&#10;&#10;The character cards &#10;There are six different characters. Each character card shows a combination of symbols for the symbol victory at the top. As soon as a player has activated the action cards with all the corresponding symbols, they win the game. Under the symbols the character is pictured with the respective special effect. The special effect can only be played once in the entire game. It can be done anytime during your own turn. To do this, the player places the character card face up in front of them for the rest of the game, so that the symbols are also revealed.&#10;&#10;End of the Game&#10;Once a player has five victory points or their combination of three required symbols in front of them, they win the game. It is also possible that four symbols are laid out.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;Ihr seid Affen im Wilden Westen und versucht euch gegen die anderen Affen durchzusetzen.

It is really good to find an adult game not aimed at large numbers of drunken party-goers but at improving the romance and sex-life of a committed couple.&#10;&#10;&#10;From the rule book: A Hot Affair will have you loving, laughing and lusting after each other with just a few throws of the die. It all begins with a loving gaze into each other's eyes. The last to blink throws the dice to start the game!&#10;&#10;As you progress round the board, the questions become more intimate &amp; the challenges more steamy.&#10;&#10;Along the way, you'll experience new, exciting and occasionally hilarious challenges with stimulating, sexy and wild conversations.&#10;&#10;The game climaxes with the winner choosing to make real one of fifty breathtaking fantasies!&#10;&#10;A Hot Affair brings back the art of fun, laughter and lust through a game so neither of you needs to be the instigator. It really does lead to the feeling that you are having an affair... but with your partner!&#10;&#10;The other great thing about the game is it can be played on a number of different levels, depending on how you both feel. If you just feel like a romantic and fun night, you can play with the first two levels; if you are both feeling a little more romantic, just shuffle the fantasy cards and have fun! With over 400 ideas at three progressive levels and 50 scenarios, the game can be enjoyed over and over!&#10;&#10;",

First person to grab the Titty wins  the match and the losing player must add the face up cards back to their hand. The first player to get rid of all of their cards wins the game. Someone grabbing the Titty without a match present has to take everyone's face up cards into his hand.&#10;&#10;Card illustrations include pictures of breasts, panties, and silhouettes. Some of the illustrations are very similar, adding to the difficulty of the game. Additional special rule cards further add complexity to the game.&#10;&#10;Titty Grab is similar in concept to Jungle Speed/Arriba!.&#10;&#10;",

A Starter Deck provides a randomized selection of 50 cards and 3 dice. A game requires two players, each with their own Starter deck. Actually you can play two different exciting game variants, Quick Shot or Playoff One-on-One Hockey Challenge, with a starter deck. Both games employ similar game mechanics, but the overall game play, strategy level, and details for each are very different. Quick Shot is a fast action, easy to learn, quick playing contest while Playoff One-on-One Hockey Challenge is a more complex game and it will take time and practice to understand its complete strategy and play possibilities. The rules for Quick Shot are presented to give newcomers the opportunity to get started quickly and become familiar with many of the basic game mechanics. For most Collectable Card Game players and as newcomers gain experience we invite you to give the complete Playoff One-on-One Hockey Challenge game rules a shot.&#10;&#10;",

At the top of the cards there are one or more small icons of dino&rsquo;s that can be defeated by that dino card. In DinoBattle every player receives four dino cards, and the player whose turn it is has to act on the last played dinosaur.&#10;&#10;The smallest scavengers are eaten by the medium sized hunters. Medium sized hunters are in turn eaten by the bigger dinos that also eat each other or can be defeated by smaller dinos working together well. Even the biggest dinos are not safe, because the meteorite can be fatal for them and thus mark a new beginning for the scavengers.&#10;After playing a card, the player replenishes his hand, unless the player failed to play a card that fitted the previous dino card. In that case the player plays on with a hand with one card less. The game ends when a player cannot play his last card, and the player with the most cards in hand wins the game. In case of a draw, the winners play a knock out round until one winner is left.&#10;It is also possible to play multiple rounds. In that case, each remaining hand card counts as 1 point, and the game ends when a player has 10 points or more.&#10;&#10;The basic game of DinoBattle is already very playable for children from 8 years, but the game contains optional cards that can make the game more challenging and interesting for older players&#10;and veterans.&#10;The survival cards offer each player a second chance and give players the possibility to survive for longer in though situations. There are three different survival cards, each with two different options that can offer salvation.&#10;Event cards add new tactical elements and offer players the possibility to achieve a unique advantage over the other players. These cards are face up on the table, visible for all players. Each player can use one event card during his turn. Used event cards are no longer available for other players. Which event card can be played depends on the dino card that is on top of the discard pile.&#10;When these optional cards are used, it is no longer possible to play another card than the askes card.&#10;&#10;If you cannot play a matching card, you are out of the game for this round. The last remaining player wins the round, and the player who wins the most rounds, wins the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Action is fast paced and tension-filled as characters exchange blows, fire spells, and even attempt to backstab. It is the fantasy battle at its best. &#10;More than simply hack and slash, strategy IS the key to victory, with cunning and skill playmg a central role in your success. Game play is an exercise in diplomacy and subterfuge, as &#239;&#187;&#191;treaties and trickery can make all the difference between victory and defeat. &#10;While The Challenge is easy to learn (start playing in less than 15 minutes), it has a depth far beyond that of the typical card game. With its excitment filled, strategy oriented, fullthrottled action, The Challenge is sure to become a classic. If you always loved combat the best ... take The Challenge.&#10;&#10;Sequence of Play:&#10;&#10;The player who rolled the high die goes first. Play moves clockwise around the table. The player can either challenge an opponent, pass, or declare a defensive turn.&#10;&#10;&#239;&#187;&#191;1) Challenge another character by using a Weapon Action Card, casting a spell (Advanced), using a magic item (Advanced) or using a thief skill (Advanced) from one of your characters against another character in another party. Both Character Cards involved are turned face-up (if they are not already). Then the defending player may retaliate with any appropriate card or pass. The challenging player may then continue by playing an appropriate Action Card or passing, followed by the defending player, etc., until both players have passed or one of the two characters involved in the challenge has died. After the challenge is resolved, the player whose tum it is can move one of his characters from one rank to another, discard any number of Action Cards, and draw from the Action Deck(s) until he has seven cards. The player that was defending in the challenge cannot discard, but can refill his hand up to seven. It is then the next player's tum.&#10;&#10;&#239;&#187;&#191;2) Pass - Do no actions, moving of characters, or discarding of cards.&#10;&#10;&#239;&#187;&#191;3) Defensive turn - You can't play any Action Card that directly affects another party. Play party Defensive Cards (Advanced), allocate Magic Cards (Advanced) to characters, move any number of characters from one rank to another, discard any number of Action Cards, and draw up to seven cards from either the Weapon Action deck or the Mystic Action deck (Advanced). Remember, you can't do two defensive turns back-to- back.&#10;&#10;",

Then he'll use any one of the two remaining until they suffer the same fate, upon which he'll use his last character.&#10;&#10;The turn is divided in 4 segments. All players undertake a segment before any begins the following segment.&#10;&#10;The 4 segments are:&#10;- &quot;D&eacute;pensez vos butins&quot; (expense your loot) where you can buy some of the &quot;big&quot; weapons cards and add them to your hand (the small ones are ALWAYS in your hand)&#10;- &quot;Pr&eacute;parez vos esquives&quot; (prepare your dodges) where you put on your character, face up, any of the weapons you bought, up to the prestige (fame) value of your character&#10;- &quot;Attaquez&quot; (attack) where each player chooses a weapon in hand and say who he attacks (players at his side for contact weapons, other players with ranged weapons)&#10;- &quot;Videz vos querelles&quot; (end your quarrels) where attacks are resolved. An attack is dodged if the defensive player has correctly found the value of the attack coming. A successful attack make the defensive character lose some of his HP, and the attacking character win prestige or loot.&#10;&#10;In plus of the weapons card, there are other cards that players can use to affect the game.&#10;&#10;If a player arrives at 5 in prestige, he can call the militia that will end the game.

The board simulates an old map and is divided into four trading regions, each with multiple ports.  Each region sells a different spice and the market price is controlled by card play.  However, an &quot;expert price&quot; can be obtained by guessing the identity of a mystery spice.  The game actually comes with around twenty small containers of real spices that get thrown into a bag.  If a player is trying to get an expert price, he picks one container  at random, opens it, sniffs it, and guesses what it is from a list of common and not so common spices.&#10;&#10;This is not the main aspect of gameplay, but it does spice it up, so to speak.  It is mostly a commodity speculation game; not only do the players need to get good prices on the spices that they are bringing back to Europe, they also need to lay in supplies in order to keep their ship on the move.  Obtaining the money to buy  supplies requires selling spices to regions other than the spice's region of origin; and in this case, a player wants the spice price to be high.&#10;&#10;Event cards add a random aspect to the game and there are pirates prowling the waters who are out to ruin a captain's best laid plans.&#10;&#10;Title translates to &quot;The Spice Route&quot;.&#10;&#10;",

Played in a zero-G court, the two six-man teams try to score with a five-kilogram steel playing ball.  Anything can happen in the meantime!  Legal actions include body, hand, and foot checks, passes, and actual goal shots.  Illegal actions, or actions requiring a penalty check, include striking with the ball or elbow, shooting the player with the ball, and all-out assaults.  The usual result of such body contact is a high player turnover rate.  The player's body armor does not guarantee physical safety from opposing players or from the ball itself.  If the game gets too rough or a fight occurs, Heartless Huey is released.  This invulnerable robot will incapacitate the nearest player.  He then moves on to the next, nearest player until all are terminated or the fighting stops.  All of these factors make Grav-Ball an exciting and action-packed game of the future.&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;&#10;    13 15mm metal miniatures and stands by Martian Metals&#10;    11&quot;x17&quot; full color mounted game board&#10;    5 sheets of tables and reference tracks&#10;    56 color counters &#10;    Rule book &#10;    2 dice&#10;&#10;&#10;",

But when it formed, it instantly became an exit point &ndash; a extra focus &ndash; for every wormhole in the entire galactic octant; the same wormholes used for interstellar travel by every starfaring species. Soon, a human starship found the Nexus, by the simple process of noticing the alternate exit point while traversing one of those wormholes. The commercial and navigational value of the nexus was obvious, and the humans began exploiting the asteroid field surrounding the exit point. They hollowed out the largest asteroid creating the core module in preparation for building a full-blown space station.&#10;&#10;Led by those same wormholes, other starships soon showed up. Then more. Now all alien civilizations want access to the Nexus. Rather than see bloodshed, the humans, ensconced in place, offered to let all share the Nexus peacefully. The humans would build the space station modules, ensuring compatibility, but the aliens would purchase and own the modules themselves. In effect, the aliens became outside investors &ndash; potentially controlling investors &ndash; thus Startropolis was born!&#10;&#10;You are the alien CEO of one of these galactic corporations, and your masters have given you seed money. What will you purchase? A solar power monopoly? Luxury habitats? Will you outperform your competition, and prove your dominance?&#10;&#10;Startropolis is a modular 3-D space station game for 2-4 people. Each turn, players buy modules and connect them to the existing space station. This creates revenue, and allows them to purchase more modules. The player with the most credits at game end wins.&#10;&#10;",

This variation of Sabacc known in Star Wars lore as &quot;Corellian Spike&quot; is the version that was played in the legendary match between Han Solo and Lando Calrissian when Han gambled to win the Millennium Falcon.&#10;&#10;The deck includes 30 green positive cards with values of 1 through 10 (3 each), 30 red negative cards with values of -1 through -10 (3 each), and two black cards with values of 0.&#10;&#10;Each game is played in three rounds. Players receive two random cards at the beginning of the game and on each turn players can either gain an additional card (optionally discarding it to draw again), swap a card in the player's hand with the top card of the discard pile, stand (take no cards), or junk (fold). Players do this in turn, and at the end of each round the dice are rolled. If the symbols match then everyone's hand is discarded, players are dealt the same amount of new cards that they discarded, and play continues.&#10;&#10;At the end of three rounds, the player whose score is closest to 0 wins the game. There are several winning hands ranked in a hierarchy that can be assembled similar to poker. For example, Pure Sabacc (both zero cards and no other cards) or Full Sabacc (a hand of +10, +10, -10, -10, and 0).&#10;&#10;",

The pieces initially occupy the entire back row, i.e., the row of spaces nearest the controlling player.  As in shogi, the sides are called sente (&quot;black&quot;) and gote (&quot;white&quot;) with sente going first, but the colors associated with the names are purely conventional.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to be the first player to capture either five or eight of an opponent's pieces, as agreed upon before starting the game.  An opponent's piece is taken by custodial capture, i.e., by being sandwiched horizontally or vertically (but not diagonally) between a player's own pieces.  A piece must be moved into such a postion immediately on either side of an opponent's piece to make a capture, but multiple captures can be made simultaneously.  This occurs only if a piece is moved so that it causes more than one enemy piece to be positioned between the piece moved and another of the player's own pieces.&#10;&#10;",

To earn points and win the game, the players attempt to sacrifice Minions from their cult to the Shoggoth (bad news for Minions, but what do you expect when you join an evil cult?). However, the Shoggoth is indiscriminate in who it eats; if you can't feed the Shoggoth on your turn with a Minion, it eats you, and you're out of the game!&#10;&#10;During your turn, if the Shoggoth is in front of you, you have the ability to sacrifice on Minion from your hand. The other Cult Leaders at the table can attempt to disrupt your sacrifice by casting spells to move the Shoggoth away from you, stealing Minions from your hand, or any one of many dastardly methods (Rival Cult Leaders are insidious that way).&#10;&#10;If the active player is still able to keep the Shoggoth in front of them during their sacrifice phase, the Minion is gobbled up, the player earns a point token, the Shoggoth moves to the player to the left, and the active player draws back up to their hand limit.&#10;&#10;The winner is either the first player to reach the victory point goal (determined how many players are participating), or the last player standing.&#10;&#10;The theme of the game is based on the works of HP Lovecraft; those players who are familiar with either the stories of HPL and/or the Call of Cthulhu role-playing game will recognize many of the names and terms on the cards. However, this isn't yet another game with the name &quot;Cthulhu&quot; tacked on at the end (and in fact, Cthulhu himself never directly makes an appearance in the game).

To create energy you need power plants, to run the plants you need natural resources which are limited. When creating the energy you also pollute and this you must compensate by cleaning the environment, but to do this you must have energy.&#10;&#10;So all in all, this is a resouce management game.

There are six potential points available for each hand; the person who takes the following earns one point (each):&#10;  - Highest Trump Card (in play)&#10;  - Lowest Trump Card (in play)&#10;  - Jack of Trump&#10;  - 6 of Trump&#10;  - Last Trick&#10;  - Most Game Points (certain cards are worth game points)&#10;&#10;Another unusual aspect to the game is that players can trump AT ANY TIME, even if they have a card of the suit that is led.  So for any given trick, your options are to either follow suit, or trump.  You can throw anything you want if you do not have a card of the suit led.&#10;&#10;The first person to score 12 points wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Rifle &amp; Saber is a tactical (company level) simulation of warfare in &quot;the age of the rifle,&quot; roughly from 1850 to 1900. The period was marked by a tremendous increase in the firepower of infantry units which far outstripped advances in tactics.&#10;&#10;The game simulates battles or portions of battles from some of the most significant wars of this period. Seventeen scenarios are drawn from battles in the American Civil War (1st Bull Run, Shiloh, Gettysburg), the Franco-Prussian War (Worth, Mars-la-Tour), the Spanish-American War, and the Boer Wars. There are also battles from minor wars in Europe, South America, and India.&#10;&#10;Included in the game are a 22&quot; by 28&quot; mapsheet  (50 meters per hex), 400 counters (muzzle-, early breech-, and late breech-loading infantry; muzzle- and breech-loading artillery; cavalry; various game markers), a 10-page, accordion-style rules booklet, a sheet of historical notes, and various play aids. Cavalry and infantry units represent about 100-150 men, artillery units about 4-6 guns, game turns about five minutes real time.&#10;&#10;",
