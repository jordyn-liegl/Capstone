Players are not allowed to look at the values of the merchandise once it is played.  Play continues placing cards, either new credit cards (total of 4 types) or merchandise underneath credit cards until a player declares that he has the $10,000 or more, in which they count up the purchases.  The person who declares the round over gets a $2000 bonus, providing that the $10,000 has indeed been reached.&#10;&#10;There is also the ability to spoil your opponents.  There are Lost Card cards which are played on an opponent causing them to have to discard a credit card and the merchandise underneath.  These can be prevented by playing an Insurance card on your pile before to protect a pile, or play another copy of the same credit card in reaction to a Lost Card being played, similar to a Mille Bornes coup-fourr&eacute;.&#10;&#10;Game ends after the round in which total purchases all game exceeds $50,000&#10;&#10;",

Each player starts with a set of nine tactic cards (three of each tactic: Attack, Block, and Taunt). At the beginning of each round, you set your hand by selecting five of your nine tactics, setting aside the remaining cards until the next round.&#10;&#10;In the two-player game, players engage in a series of clashes, using each card only once. (Tactic cards are discarded after use.) They secretly select their tactics, then simultaneously reveal them and resolve the clash: Attach beats Taunt, Taunt beats Block, Block beats Attack. The winner of a clash takes possession of the Leaf Totem, and whoever possesses the Leaf Totem at the end of the round scores a point. The first player to 3 points wins.&#10;&#10;In a three- or four-player game, the first clash is a free-for-all clash for the Leaf Totem. After that, play proceeds around the table in a king-of-the-hill style. Each challenger clashes against the current totem holder. If you can defeat all challengers consecutively without losing the totem, you score a point. As in the two-player game, first to 3 points wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

When you win, you get rewards; if you lose you get a &quot;skull&quot; token.&#10;You can also fight other players if you move to their location, to try and take one of their items.&#10;If at any point you accumulate 4 skulls, you lose the next turn (and start again without skulls).&#10;Whoever is first to reach the center of the board and correctly uncover their target precious stones wins!&#10;&#10;",

In Hoagie, the game designer developed a game that would be fun both for young children and parents, making this game a valuable part of any family game collection.&#10;&#10;Hoagie is a card game. Players are dealt a hand of &quot;ingredient cards&quot; and a few &quot;action cards.&quot; Players attempt to build sandwiches by placing ingredient cards such as bread, cheese, meat, and lettuce in front of them, face up on the table, in order. Players may foul other players' ingredients by placing spoiled ingredient cards over opposing sandwiches. Action cards such as &quot;skip&quot; &quot;reverse&quot; and &quot;double-play&quot; add spice to the game.&#10;&#10;The first player with an unspoiled hoagie sandwich on the table wins.

The board consists of a (very sketchy) schematic of the battle area overlaid with arrows indicating the troop movements, much as one might see on a diagram of a battle.&#10;&#10;The arrows are divided into spaces - on a turn, a player rolls a die and moves a piece (infantry or cavalry - the artillery does not move) along the appropriate arrow (which arrow or arrows it can use depends on where it starts).  Landing on certain spaces may let you advance further, or may destroy the piece (there are a number of the latter spaces on the Light Brigade&#039;s paths).  Getting to the end of an arrow destroys an enemy piece, generally, but sometimes has other effects on the opponent.&#10;&#10;There are special rules for each group indicating what its orders are or what it actually did in the battle, more or less (some can traverse the arrows more than once, etc.).&#10;&#10;While the box says that either 2 or 4 people can play, there is no provision in the rules for more than 2, and no obvious way to accommodate this.&#10;&#10;Greensmith designed a similar game for Palitoy on the battle of Waterloo.&#10;&#10;",

The first Amulet on top of the pack of cards must be given, you cannot choose. The prisoner freed last will reveal to which element the Monster belongs and this time he will give a piece of Amulet with a sign contrary to that of the Monster, no longer a piece chosen at random.&#10;&#10;2 - After freeing the last prisoner, add the remaining pieces of Amulet to the &quot;Room&quot; pack of cards, so that every player can complete his/her Amulet. You can attack the Monster only if you have 4 pieces of Amulet and after all the Prisoners have been set free. Re-shuffle the pack of &quot;Room&quot; cards and also the pack of the &quot;Runes of Power&quot;.&#10;&#10;3 - Chase the Monster and, if you are able to get it, give it a sound beating! The life points of the Monster are given according to the Monsters Table. It is not at all certain that you will be able to defeat it at the first attack. N.B. The Adventurer that defeats the Monster is teleported out of the Millenarocca, he is safe and he leaves the other players busy with phase 4 of the game.&#10;&#10;4 - The Adventurers left must reach one of the exits and they must avoid perishing in the collapse of the Millenarocca.&#10;&#10;Essentially, the winners are those able to come out of the Millenarocca.&#10;&#10;",

After the game, the island will change for the next time those children lose themselves &mdash; and you know it will happen again!&#10;&#10;After choosing your character and learning about your special abilities in Pan's Island, each player is responsible for hiding a pirate and a Lost Child. Thanks to a hand of clue cards representing dreams made by the characters, each player can give clues on the location of the Lost Children or the pirates to avoid. These clue cards are played on another player's board by placing them on a &quot;scale of relevance&quot; ranging from &quot;Exactly&quot; to &quot;Not at all&quot;. The player then needs to correctly interpret the clue to move around and search for the Lost Children in the correct area. The game is won when five Lost Children have been found, but it ends if you encounter the pirates more than twice.&#10;&#10;At the end of a game and depending on your success, event cards will change the topology of the island, bring in new rules, and determine how you pursue your adventure. If you've lost, the island may become easier to explore or make you more powerful, but if you've won, new obstacles appearing on the island will make your new adventures a bit more difficult quest.&#10;&#10;",

There have been at least 14 editions of this game published. Speed is a predecessor of the popular game UNO and a contemporary of Whot.&#10;&#10;Players are dealt a hand of cards (6 cards for 2 or 3 players, 5 cards for 4 or 5 players). Players play cards by matching the set of the previously played card (Aeroplane, Train, Ship, Motor or Animal), or by playing a card bearing the same number in the top corner (the Animal suit has 2 numbers per card). When a player is unable to do either of these, he draws a card from the draw deck.&#10;&#10;'Lightning' cards act as wild cards, allowing the player to call the next set to be played.  There is one 'Extra Turn' card that can be played in addition to a normal card (hence the only chance to get rid of 2 cards in a turn).&#10;&#10;When the first person has finished, the others score penalty points equal to the sum of the numbers on the cards they have left in their hand.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "The Hollywood Card Game is a fast and simple card game from Bruno Faidutti and Michael Schacht, designers of such games as Citadels, Coloretto and Fist of Dragonstones. This exciting and unique card game invites players to compete to get the best directors and most famous actors for their films. With an easily accessible theme, and simple but deep gameplay, The Hollywood Card Game appeals as much to casual gamers as it does to hardcore strategists.&#10;&#10;The game plays over 3-4 rounds (the same number as the number of players), with each player having one turn to play first. Each round a new Hollywood Area is created by shuffling 3 Star cards and 11 Movie cards together and dealing them out into 4 columns. Players take turns either placing a marker on the bottom card of a column (pushing the preceding markers up the column), or playing one of their Studio cards (Skip a turn, or take two turns in a row). Each studio card can only be used once per game. Once each card in a column has a marker on it, that column is closed, and no more markers have been played in this column.&#10;&#10;Once all players have run out of markers, the round is over, and cards are allocated to players based on the marker on the card, and starting from the TOP left corner. Cards are allocated one at a time, and must be used on a Project immediately. Film cards must be allocated to a Project of the same genre (Horror, Action, or Romantic Comedy), or allocated to a new project if the player does not already have a Project of that genre. Star cards must be allocated to any project, however this will immediately complete a Movie, which no more cards can be added to. If a Star card cannot be allocated to a project, they cannot be held to add to a later project. Movies score points for the number of Film cards in them (with Award Film cards counting twice), multiplied by the number of stars on the Star card. Blockbuster cards stand alone and are worth 2 points each. Additionally, each player scores one point for each Film card in their largest unfinished project (no ties allowed). The player with the most points wins. If players are tied, the player with the single most valuable movie is the winner.&#10;&#10;The Hollywood Card Game contains 64 cards, 16 film reel chips, and a rule sheet. The game is suitable for three to four players Ages 8 and up&#10;&#10;",

ELECTRIC BOOGALOO&#10;&#10;// INTRODUCTION &not;&#10;&#10;In 1930, the Pabodie Expedition left for the Antarctic Continent to carry out Geological prospecting operations. &#10;Part of the crew died and some of its members returned suffering from terrible psychological trauma due to the unfathomable primeval horrors they encountered.&#10;In late 1934 all contact was lost with the Starkweather-Moore Expedition. It had followed in the footsteps of the first expedition, but all its team disappeared without leaving a trace.&#10;In 1937 the millionaire philanthropist Alejo Crow begins investigating these strange occurrences.&#10;On board the battleship Gigamesh, following the geographic indications hidden in the Necronomicon, the Crow-Yutani Expedition, comprising a select group of explorers and a commando of clone soldiers known as &ldquo;macutes&rdquo;, must face the sinister creatures that await them in the polar ice.&#10;    &#10;// OBJECT OF THE GAME &not;&#10;A cooperative game in which players must try to survive the attack of primeval beings and kill all the monsters. Players lose if the attackers completely destroy the battleship &ldquo;Gigamesh&rdquo; or all the explorers of the resistance die.&#10;All players fight for one common goal: defending the ship from the waves of attacks of 43 monsters that try to devour them.&#10;&#10;// GAME CONTENTS &not;&#10;&#10;&raquo; 43 monster tiles&#10;&raquo; 14 special tiles&#10;&raquo; 15 explorers with bases&#10;&raquo; 4 barricade tokens&#10;&raquo; 6 destroyed ship  tokens&#10;&raquo; 45 action cards&#10;&raquo; 3 dice&#10;&raquo; 1 board&#10;&raquo; 1 rule book&#10;&#10;&#10;En 1937, el millonario fil&aacute;ntropo Alejo Crow emprende una investigaci&oacute;n para esclarecer los hechos.&#10;&#10;A bordo del acorazado Gigamesh, siguiendo las indicaciones geogr&aacute;ficas ocultas en el Necronomic&oacute;n y compuesta por un selecto grupo de exploradores y de un comando de soldados cl&oacute;nicos conocidos como ?macutes?, la Expedici&oacute;n Crow-Yutani deber&aacute; enfrentarse a las siniestras criaturas que esperan entre los hielos polares.&#10;&#10;Este juego se basa en la novela Fanhunter: Las Monta&ntilde;as de la Locura.

Players have escaped the modern-day zombie hoard only to find themselves transported back in time and faced with a whole new set of problems!&#10;&#10;Game play is fairly straightforward.  Players start at the well and their objective is either to kill 25 points worth of skeletons or to collect the Necromicon from the graveyard and return with it to the Altar.  The various skeletons are worth different points, White are worth 1, Red are worth 2, and Blue are worth 3.&#10;&#10;Players start by drawing a tile and placing it on the board anywhere it will fit.  They then place a number of skeletons and villagers as shown on the tile.  They then roll a six-sided die (d6) for movement.  Movement is orthogonal and limited to the tiles currently in play.  If you encounter a villager you can collect it; skeletons you encounter must be overcome.  At the end of your turn you again roll the d6 to move that many skeletons 1 space each.&#10;&#10;Players can collect up to 5 villagers who can be sacrificed if they lose a fight.  Combat is simple - enter a square with a skeleton and on a 4 or better on a d6, you win.  If the roll is less than 4, you can either sacrifice a villager or pay skeletons to reach 4 or better.  There is no change, so if you roll a 3 and only have reds, you now have a 5.&#10;&#10;Some of the cards also require specific colors of skeletons be used in order to power them and many require that you kill skeletons in order to play them.&#10;&#10;Once a player reaches the Graveyard and grabs the Necronomicon, the other players can attack him during their turns to try to steal it away from him.  The game ends when someone takes the Necronomicon to the center tile of the Altar or collects 25 points worth of skeletons.&#10;&#10;This Zombies!!! sized box contains 30 map tiles, 50 event cards,  6 pawns, 50 sculpted life counters (little gray dudes), rules and 100 HEAVILY ARMED AND ANGRY SKELETON WARRIORS!!! The whole game is done with the same realistic but very tongue-in-cheek style you have come to expect from Twilight Creations.&#10;&#10;Part of the MidEvil/Zombies!!! series&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Midevil II: Castle Chaos&#10;    MidEvil III:  Subterranean Homesick Blues!&#10;&#10;&#10;",

There are six rows of cards representing airplane stunts, and no row may contain two cards of the same color or shape. Each turn a player draws a card from his pile (or on the first turn from a neutral pile), then all players try to find a legal placement for that card; the first player to do so draws a card from his pile to start the next turn. Calling an incorrect row earns that player a crash chip, and three crash chips eliminates him from the game. The first player to run out of cards wins.&#10;&#10;Crash Pilot has also been published with a grocery store theme as Check Out.&#10;&#10;",

In their final global nuclear strike, humanity accomplished two things: They wiped themselves out, and they created a highly mutagenic environment where the monsters could thrive.&#10;&#10;This is the world at the start of Teratozoic, a light deck-building game. (From greek: terato-, of or relating to monsters, -zoic, of a (specified) era, or having a (specified) animal mode of existence.) Each player has their own deck of monster parts (their gene pool), and will attempt to make the best of the mutations they draw from a common deck to come out on top in the battle for survival. At first the monsters will be more random mutation than representative of a stable gene pool (players will draw most of the cards for each hand from the common deck), but by the time players reach the Teratozoic Era, their monsters will be built entirely from the best traits they've been able to retain each generation.&#10;&#10;The dominant species in this new era (the final winner of the game) will be the one with the most robust gene pool&mdash;the player who can create the biggest, most impressive monsters at the end of the Teratozoic Era.&#10;&#10;",

Now walk to the Woozle. He only eats snacks from a spoon, so be careful not to drop them! For every snack you are able to feed the Woozle, take a yummy card from the tray and place it near all the players. The yummy cards track the number of snacks you feed the Woozle. Play continues clockwise with the next player rolling the die, placing that number of snack tokens on the spoon and feeding the Woozle. If everyone together feeds the Woozle 12 snacks before the snacks are gone, you all win! If you use up all the snacks before you feed the Woozle 12, the Woozle stays hungry.&#10;&#10;",
