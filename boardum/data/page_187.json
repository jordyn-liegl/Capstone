It took him six days to complete his work, assisted by a host of heavenly angels doing his divine bidding. On the seventh day God rested and examined the result. Seeing that it was good, he praised the angel who had contributed the most.&#10;&#10;Genesis - In the Beginning gives you the chance to become that angel. By gathering the essence of creation - chaos, matter and life - and turning it into seas and mountains, birds and beasts, you hope to win Gods approval - and the game! But the way to victory is wrought with hard decisions. You must gather essence when it's most advantageous, move at the right time and do your days&rsquo; work where they count the most. And beware of the dark angel who's trying to outshine you all.&#10;&#10;Now - let there be light!&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Contents1 game board&#10;1 God&#10;1 dark angel&#10;6 player angels&#10;42 day work markers&#10;1 starting player marker&#10;72 essence cubes&#10;1 rules booklet&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;GameplayBefore the creation, the players&rsquo; angels are gathered in the void with God. When God starts the creation with the words &quot;let there be light&quot;, the angels start their monumental task. There&rsquo;s a lot do to and only seven days to get it done in, so every action counts. Throughout the game, God moves over each of the seven days on the game board, stopping morning, midday and evening, allowing the players 21 rounds to act. During their turn, players can choose to collect the essence of creation (chaos, matter and life), to do a day work on the current day using the different kinds of essence they have collected, or to follow in God&rsquo;s path to another day.&#10;&#10;When players move from day to day, they&rsquo;re positioned along the essence track. The essence track determines both the order of play and the type of essence a player can gather. The first player to move to a certain day gets the first position, the second player the second position, and so on. As different positions yield different kinds of essence, the players must plan their movement to get the right kind and the right amount of essence. If they&rsquo;re not happy with their position, they can spend essence to swap positions with a neighboring angel, thereby also thwarting other players&rsquo; plans.&#10;&#10;When God creates a new day with new tasks for the angels, players can move to that day. The first player to do a day work on a certain day is awarded the highest points, the second player the second highest, and so on. As the week progresses, the points earned for doing a day work increase, which affects players&rsquo; long-term strategy.&#10;&#10;As the seventh day is a day of rest, God looks favorably on angels that retire from their hard work. The first player to retire their angel on the seventh day earns the highest points, the second player the second highest, and so on. When God reaches the evening of the seventh day, the game is over. All points will be tallied and the player with the highest score is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;To make things even more challenging, a dark angel is mixed in with the players&rsquo; angels, doing his best to snatch as many points as possible. The dark angel follows a pre-determined pattern of actions that the players can predict and delay but never stop. If the players aren&rsquo;t careful, or if they&rsquo;re too caught up in their own plans, the dark angel will surely outshine them, making all of them lose the game.&#10;&#10;The mechanics of the game are quite simple: the sooner you do a day work on a day, the higher the points you score, making it a good idea to keep close in God&rsquo;s wake. Unfortunately, simply following God throughout the creation might not give you the exact essence you need to do your day work. Eventually you must stop to collect essence, preferably in the right position, making you lose momentum. In the end it&rsquo;s always about choices: when and what to collect, when to move and when to do a day work. The winner, God willing, is the player who makes the right choices at the right time, a task easier said than done.&#10;&#10;",

These components represent the participants and locations of two ACW Confederate Cavalry engagements that involved the southern raider, General Nathan Bedford Forrest. The two battles, Brice's Crossroads and Tupelo, resulted from U.S. General William T. Sherman's campaign to remove Forrest as a threat to his flank and supply lines. Before the Union Army marched on Atlanta, Elements of Sherman's Army pursued Forrest, and others, into Mississippi and engaged his cavalry twice before its destruction at Tupelo.&#10;&#10;All game-turns represent approximately 1 hour real time, and each Strength Point is the equivalent of 50 men or 1 gun. In Brice's Crossroads, the map scale is 115 yards per hex. In Tupelo the scale is 160 yards per hex.&#10;&#10;This game is an excellent example of the, ever evolving, TSS/GBACW game system. New rules for Cavalry and a modified sequence of play are just couple of the many refinements. I've always wanted to adapt these refinements to the earlier TSS Cavalry game Rebel Sabers: Civil War Cavalry Battles by SPI (Simulations Publications, Inc.). The game components are on par with any game in the system.&#10;&#10;It was included in Issue #119 0f Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine).&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "A pure bluffing game. Each player gets a set of cards numbered 1 to 8 and a playing mat, which goes in front of him or her. The starting player is the Baron and the other players in turn offer him a card face down from their hand, stating the value. Each player must offer an equal or higher value card than the last and the Baron must take the highest card offered or choose between equal offers. The Baron must then decide to Accept or Reject the offer. If he accepts, the Baron puts the card face down on his mat and the turn passes to the next player. But if the Baron decides the player was lying and Rejects the offer, he turns the card over. If the offer was False, the player takes it back to their hand and the Baron gets to dump one of his cards onto his mat. But if it was True, The Baron must take the card into his hand and the player dumps a card face down. When a player's hand is empty, the game is over and you total the value of the cards on your mat, subtracting any left in your hand. Highest score wins. A simple game of pure bluff, it works incredibly well. Very funny and requires some thought. Baron Muenchausen is a famous character from German folklore, a notorious liar who lived a fantastical life. The game mats show illustrations and stories from his life in German, but this has nothing to do with the actual game play and non-German readers can play the game easily.&#10;&#10;",

From Manila to Tsushima you command in a playable, fast-paced recreation.&#10;&#10;Fire When Ready has two player, solitaire, and multi-palyer scenarios with basic and advanced rules.

The Game contains the rulebook, 288 counters, one color map and 10 sheets of charts and tables.&#10;&#10;The game uses Ben Madison and Wes Erni's &quot;Charles S. Roberts Award&quot; winning Death in the Trenches: The Great War, 1914-1918 system to simulate the American Civil War. Units represent Generals (their component brigades are represented off-map), elite units (Iron Brigade, Cobb's Legion), cavalry (Stuart, Stoneman), guerillas (Quantrill, Kirk), and Indians (Choctaws, Delawares, Stand Watie). Like Death in the Trenches: The Great War, 1914-1918 random events and &quot;Special Event Coins&quot; are crucial, and there are about 400 (yes, 400) of them.&#10;&#10;Forming stacks into 'Grand Armies' (e.g. Army of the Potomac, Army of Northern Virginia) enables the various commanders in the stack to coordinate their fighting powers. Cavalry have special abilities but also a habit of running away when you need them. Guerillas ravage the countryside (Quantrill, Price, Morgan -- and the less widely known Union barbarian, George Kirk). Generals do not always follow orders to move, and sometimes must be prodded by expending irreplaceable command chits. Special rules cover foreign intervention, the border states, as well as McClellan, Lee, Jackson and a few other characters. Naval warfare (Confederate commerce raiding) is handled by an extremely simple, elegant abstract model complete with a world map.&#10;&#10;The game is won by either capturing the government marker of either player or destroying his economy. Capturing cities and winning naval battles increases the enemy's inflation rate, which affects a lot of elements like national elections (there are three over the course of the game--one in the Confederacy!) and reinforcement rates.&#10;&#10;",

The mid-weight pick-up &amp; delivery game has players taking on the roles of monster hunters from the paranormal society, Invisible, Inc. Guided by your helpful and often maniacal AI assistant, Boogle, the hunters search a haunted house for the AR monsters lurking in the various rooms. It&rsquo;s their mission to find the correct gear and capture three monsters first. But if the house gets overrun by Haunted Objects, the monsters escape the board and HAUNT YOUR HOUSE in a real-world AR monster hunt!&#10;&#10;On your turn, a player takes three actions from seven potential actions. Players must move through the house collecting the specific gear they need to catch the monsters hiding in the house. Using the Boogle app, players can scan the house to find the monster and ultimately catch them. But beware of Haunted Objects lurking in the house that will scare you back to the starting gate.&#10;&#10;At the end of each player&rsquo;s turn, it&rsquo;s the monster&rsquo;s turn, having the players roll the Monster Dice, which often brings new challenges but can bring rewards, too. If three Haunted Objects are unveiled in the house or the Grand Escape icon is rolled, the house becomes unstable and the monsters escape the board in an AR monster hunting event. The player who blasts the most monsters in the Grand Escape is rewarded two gear tiles and the chance to rid the house of one Haunted Object. The first player to capture three monsters is the winner!&#10;&#10;The game can be played with or without the AR app.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "The diversity of doctrines, weapons, training methods and leadership in medieval armies was a function of the geographic and cultural diversity in which those armies originated. Consequently, many military systems developed along divergent lines until the time of the widespread use of gunpowder, which dominated Renaissance warfare. Black Prince: Crecy &amp; Navarette (BP) reflects that diversity by simulating two battles, both of which represented a clash of distinct weapons and tactics.&#10;&#10;Navarette is a simulation of the conflict between English and Castilian forces and their French allies near the Spanish village of Najera on 3 April 1367, during the Hundred Years War. The battle marked the culmination of the Black Prince&rsquo;s campaign to overthrow the usurper Henry the Bastard and regain the throne of Castille for the rightful king, Pedro the Cruel. The scales are 50 yards per hex, 500 men per standard counter, 1,500 per double-length counter, and 20 minutes per game turn.&#10;&#10;At Crecy, in 1346, the French knights in Philip&rsquo;s army were the elite of the country, and felt themselves to be the epitome of chivalry. That led them to treat the foot soldiers of both sides with contempt. Thus, when charging, only English knights were worthy of their attention. Also, when their own archers faltered before the hail of English arrows, they saw them as cowards and traitors not worthy of being on the field. The scales here are 80 yards per hex, 400 to 500 men per standard counter, 1,200 per double-length counter, and 40 minutes per game turn.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Rules cover such things as: rout, plat armor, English longbows, crossbows, leadership and much more. The turn sequence for both games is as follows.A. First Player Turn&#10;1. Rout Removal Phase&#10;2. Rout Movement Phase&#10;3. Movement Phase&#10;4. Fire Combat Phase&#10;5. First Player Melee Phase&#10;6. Second Player Melee Phase&#10;&#10;B. Second Player Turn&#10;1. Simultaneous Rout Removal Phase&#10;2. Rout Movement Phase&#10;3. Movement Phase&#10;4.

His victory eventually led to the establishment of the modern British nation. 1066: End of the Dark Ages can be played by two, three or four, each representing a different side: Anglo-Saxons, Normans, Vikings and Britons (the latter representing an amalgamation of the various peoples then indigenous to the island).&#10;&#10;Each of the 12 game turns represent a calendar month. Each fully iconic, large-size, unit represents roughly 1,000 to 5,000 fighting men or key individual leaders along with their elite 'household' troops. Each square on the 34x22&quot; map represents 40 miles across, with all of England, Wales and southern Scotland, as well as the north coast of France, depicted on it.&#10;&#10;Each player has a variety of military and political instruments with which he can attempt to gain control of Britain. Every tactic and stratagem available historically to the would-be kings of England &ndash; from diplomacy through treachery, the laws of fealty and homage, vassalage, appeals to the Pope, assassination, pillage, shield walls, fortification, heavenly omens, gold, spies, rebellion, navies and, of course, savage warfare &ndash; are again in play here.&#10;&#10;The game contains one scenario, with adaptive rules that allow it to be played by two, three or four opponents. The rules contain approximately 14,000 words, which will allow experienced players to get through a complete game in about four to six hours.&#10;&#10;",

Players then take turns playing a card from their hand or cards set aside from previous hands. Cards include Power cards (basic attack or defense in a skill type), Universe cards (e.g., a city bus, which adds value to a Strength attack), Special cards (usually character specific with varying effects), and more in later expansions. At the end of each hand, the damage from that hand is totaled; the player who caused the most &quot;completes&quot; their wagered missions, while the other player is &quot;defeated&quot; with those missions. Players may concede a hand instead of playing a card, losing their missions but avoiding further damage&#10;&#10;A player wins when they have knocked out all 4 opposing characters, &quot;completed&quot; all of their missions, or their opponent is &quot;defeated&quot; in all missions.

The trick is won by the highest trump card played, or by the highest card of the suit led if no trumps are present.  The winner of the trick leads the next trick.&#10;&#10;At the end of each hand, each player scores one point for each trick taken, minus points for jacks:&#10;&#10;hearts   = -1 point&#10;   diamonds = -2 points&#10;   spades   = -3 points&#10;   clubs    = -4 point&#10;&#10;(Mnemonic: if you have to take a Jack, you would love to take the one which hurts the least.  Getting hit with a club hurts the most; getting hit with a spade hurts too, but not as much.)&#10;&#10;A player may have a negative score. The winner is the first player to reach 20 points.&#10;&#10;",

You assume the role of a small shipwrecked crew trying to reach the Indies after a failed expedition deep in the South Pacific. This game uses a worker placement system to assign to jobs such as steer your boat, fish, encounter natives, gather resources, and watch for weather. A handful of dice are allocated in a press-your-luck fashion. For those that enjoy role-playing, there is also an optional Journaling phase where you try to tell a story about what happened on your turn. Can you reach the Indies before you lose all of your crew members or get blown off course completely?&#10;&#10;THEME&#10;You and three of your fellow shipwrecked sailors have spent three weeks on this small South Pacific island after a storm smashed your ship into some shoals. You have cannibalized what you can of your wrecked caravel and created a tiny sloop to get you to the Indies. However, you are in uncharted waters and have heard rumors of cannibal tribes on islands dotting this vast ocean.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Brain Warp is an electronic memory game with voice commands. It is shaped like a sphere with 6 knobs sticking out of it. The knobs all have different colors and are numbered 1-6. There are 6 different games to play. In the first game, the voice calls out a color and the player must quickly rotate the Brain Warp until the color called is facing upward. The next game is the same only it uses the numbers. Other games include: colors and numbers, combinations of colors and numbers, code buster, and a passing game in which players add to an ever growing sequence. The Brain Warp calls out the winner at the end of each game.&#10;&#10;The Brain Warp must be held straight for the game sensors to &quot;read&quot; selections correctly. It must be rotated from selection to adjacent selection - not diagonally or through another color. Correct selections receive a Confirmation Tone, incorrect selections (or if you take to long) receive a Razz tone.&#10;&#10;There were 3 different revisions of the Brain Warp made. The first one had bad music and sound programming whilst the voice had a lower pitch comparing against the music. The second version fixed all of that but the 2.0 has problems with gameplay after 36 points in Colors, Numbers and Combo. Then in 2002 a black version was made which had a better speaker and a wider pitch differences between game units.&#10;&#10;The game also has a hidden test mode. To access it, you need to unscrew the yellow knob, position the game to the purple position and press the power button to access it. Different censors do diferent things. The red censor repeats the number that each knob is, the white button plays all the sound effects, the orange button does all the voices, the green knob plays the music and the purple knob makes a beep. The yellow knob goes back to game mode.&#10;&#10;",

So for example, if Player A's back hand was a full house, his middle hand was two pair, and his front hand a pair of jacks, while Player B's corresponding hands were a flush, three-of-a-kind, and a pair of nines, Player B would owe Player A two betting units.&#10;&#10;Other scoring options include bonuses for especially strong hands (e.g., you win four extra bets if your back or middle hand is a straight flush), and &quot;surrender,&quot; which allows you to throw away a particularly bad set of cards and just pay a fixed penalty fee to each opponent.&#10;&#10;In another variant, if you have all fours, you instantly win.&#10;&#10;",

Venture out in costumes on Halloween and collect candies, but beware of the ghosts who can bring you all sorts of cute surprises.&#10;&#10;Players follow standard trick-taking rules without a trump suit, with one candy card being selected for scoring after each trick. Players can play ghost cards that always follow suit and trigger special effects. After resolution, ghost cards are added to the Trick-winner's hand. In Cooperative Mode, each player needs to collect 4 different candy cards. In Competitive Mode, players are divided into two teams; the team that collects all ghost cards loses the game, otherwise the team with the higher score wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "In 1486, Christopher Columbus came to Spain to lobby the royal families to endorse his plan to sail west and discover a new trade route to the Indies. Columbus was not the only one with this idea, though, as during that great age of explorers there was no lack of ambitious sailors willing to risk it all on a grand adventure.&#10;&#10;In Voyagers' Venture, players assume the role of Spanish sailors in 1486, working to fund their voyage for a new trade route. In order to succeed, they must win resources, prepare a sturdy fleet, entice the Spanish nobles, and even acquire the patronage of the royal family. After six years of campaigning, who will secure the royal edict of Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand to strike out towards the new world? Could you be Columbus? Perhaps you could be even greater? It all starts with one voyager's venture, but to get that permit to sail west and search for land, you need to gain the most reputation.&#10;&#10;Each round plays out as below:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Sponsor from Royal Family:  From the common card deck and the fleet deck, draw and display a number of cards.&#10;     Dividing Sponsor: Starting with the starting player and moving along the turn order track, each player will declare what they want from the face up and face down cards on offer this year. Starting clockwise from the choosing player, each player decides if they agree or not to give the active player what they chose. There can be two results:&#10;         All the players agree: If all the players agree, the active player immediately recieves all the cards they chose and takes those cards into his or her hand.&#10;         One player disagrees: The agreeing phase stops when a player disagrees and the disagreeing player immediately makes a bid on the cards on offer smaller than the bid of the previous player.  There are 3 ways to cut a bid:&#10;             Place one of your gold dubloons on one card that the previous player did not choose.  If you do this, you may keep the bid the same size and move straight to the agree/disagree phase (2).  The gold dubloon is attached to the card it is placed on until a player takes that card, and that player also takes your dubloon.&#10;             Remove 1 or more cards from this bid.&#10;             Remove 2 or more cards from the bid, then add 1 card on display to the bid.&#10;        &#10;    &#10;     Assembling Fleets: Each player will receive one bid.  After the last player receives his or her bid, this round is over.  Check that each player has 8 or less cards in hand.  If they have more, they must discard, face-down, down to 8.  Take the turn markers from the next round track and move them to the same positions in the current round track.  Move the queen marker to the next round.  Start the next round.&#10;&#10;&#10;End of the Game&#10;&#10;The game finishes at the end of round 6.  At this time, each player has one last chance to use the resources they have in hand to buy ships and nobles.  Then discard all remaining ship and noble cards in hands.&#10;&#10;     Follow the game tip card to determine end of game bonus reputation.&#10;     Display all ships and noble reputation in front of you, calculate the total and add it to your reputation.&#10;     If a player has the fastest fleet token, add the bonus (2) to his or her reputation.&#10;     If a player has gold coins, each 2 is worth 1 reputation.&#10;     Subtract 1 reputation for each smuggled goods that player has.&#10;&#10;&#10;The player with the highest reputation wins the game, and the royal edict of Queen Isabella to strike out for new trade routes.  If there is a draw, the player with the most ships is the winner, if there still is a draw, the player with the most total resources is the winner, if it is still a tie check the card number on each players' ships.  The player with the lowest card number on any ship is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

The 2 versions of the game are side winder where you try to go across the board either from top to bottom or down from top to bottom or Race where the tiles are arranged 2x8 and you go the long way from top to bottom.&#10;&#10;Strategy: oddly enough there is a lot.

In this game, spades is always the trump suit.&#10;&#10;The players win the game if at the end of 12 tricks, one player has won 6 tricks, another has won 4 tricks, another 2, and the last 0.  Additionally, the cards remaining in the players' hands must each be of a different suit.  The players will earn a score based upon the difference in the rank of the card remaining in the hands of the players who took 6 and 0 tricks.&#10;&#10;The game includes variants for 1, 2, and 3 players.&#10;&#10;",

However, beneath every hero lies an average human being, who has a job to perform, daily expenses to pay and crime fighting gadgets to buy. Little did they know that their credit card bills are feeding the ultimate monster of mass destruction: Debtzilla.&#10;&#10;Debtzilla is a 2 to 4 player, cooperative board game in which heroes work together to protect ordinary citizens from being scammed by Villains, and take down the final boss: Debtzilla.

Using a combination of deck building and dice mechanics, players have to race against time to bring down the bad guys before the law of compounding debt interest destroys their chances of winning the game. Be too stingy on your finances and you will find your hero too weak to do any good in a real fight. On the other hand, splurging too much on those flashy hero gadgets on borrowed money will result in the final boss too difficult to defeat.

    "description": "Welcome to Kings' Struggle, a negotiation-focused card game with elements of trick-taking and set collection. The game is mechanically simple, with each player playing just one card per round, and each game lasting only seven rounds. Over the course of these seven rounds, players vie to win cards and earn gold through various means, which will score the victory points required to win.&#10;&#10;While this sounds simple, what makes Kings' Struggle special are the unique card abilities that have been crafted to drive negotiation. The ability of a card you've played can be activated on your turn &mdash; or not. It's up to you. Just remember, your action or inaction is for sale! Analyzing who has the most to win or the most to lose from your current ability and leveraging it to your maximum benefit is the name of the game.&#10;&#10;You must learn to play the players, more than you learn to play the game. While anyone can learn to play Kings' Struggle in a matter of minutes, players who find success will not be those who craft the best linear card play strategy, or those who enjoy the most luck, but those who have mastered the art of negotiation.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Therefore, the players have to collect karma by building their lifelines and donate cards for the lifelines of other players. The way to human life is hard and the players live the lifes of several animals like the earthworm, cat, chameleon or the ape.&#10;&#10;Information about the Novel &quot;Bad Karma&quot; from David Safier:&#10;&#10;This debut novel by David Safier follows the trials and tribulations of Kim Karlsen, a television personality whose career obsession brings her some serious cosmic repercussions. In her quest to dominate the airwaves, Kim cheats on her husband, neglects her daughter, and mistreats her staff. It all seems worth it when she wins the biggest German Television Award, but sadly on the very same night she is crushed to death by debris falling from a Russian space station. At the gates of Heaven, she is informed that she has collected too much bad karma in her life, and has a long road of atonement ahead. Reincarnation as an ant teaches her a few lessons in humility, and she experiences existence as a guinea pig and as a beagle before regaining human form just in time to sabotage the marriage of her husband to her back-stabbing best friend.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "This is a reincarnation of TCG &quot;Duel Masters&quot; with some minor changes in rules.&#10;Each player has a deck full of creatures and spells. The goal of the game is to finish an opponent with one of your creature's attacks. However, each player is protected by 5 shields, represented by face-down cards from a player's own deck. When your creature attacks an opponent (and is not blocked by another creature) it breaks one of his shields, and the shield card goes to the owner's hand.  When your creature attacks a defenseless opponent, you win the game.&#10;&#10;The game has some similarities with the grandfather of collectible card games - Magic: the Gathering, which is also made by Wizards of the Coast. However, it has two major differences:&#10;1. There is no distinct card class for producing mana. The same cards, representing creatures and spells, can produce mana if placed in the Mana Zone instead of the Battle Zone. This removes what many see as a major flaw of Magic: the Gathering - &quot;mana flood&quot; and &quot;mana screw&quot;.&#10;2. There are no instant spells or activated abilities. Therefore, there are far fewer surprises for players from their opponents and also fewer tactical decisions during play. On the other hand, it plays quicker and can be easier for children to learn and understand. Even so, it has strong strategic aspects and fun deck building.&#10;&#10;",

The game covers the American involvement in the VietNam War (from 1965-1972) and offers players the options to expand the war in ways that few games on this conflict allow.

Sake flows freely, but not even the cellars of Bishamon, the God of War, could quench the thirst of Japan's greatest swordsmen. Servants run for cover, knowing full well where all this is going. Suddenly an eerie silence fills the common room. On the table, only one full cup remains. Who will get the last drink? Will it be the elder of the group, or shall the greatest warrior have it? Time seems to stretch to infinity, until one hand makes a move toward the cup. Such insolence! This insult shall not be tolerated! The elder goes for his sword...&#10;&#10;We shall never know whether the bold samurai was taking the cup for himself or only to hand it to his venerable companion. It does not matter: all warriors take offense and draw their katanas, joining the fight at the call of &quot;SAAKEEE!&quot;&#10;&#10;In Sake &amp; Samurai you are a fierce and thirsty samurai warrior, willing to do anything to get the last cup of Sake. The winner is the most drunk samurai &ndash; in game terms, the player who has collected the most Sake drink counters &ndash; at the end of the Sudden Death round.&#10;&#10;Be wary, though, for drinking too much will dull your wits and mastery with the sword. Each drink of Sake prevents you from using one of your resources, be it a weapon, an item, or even your personal skill! You must always be wary not to drink too much or you risk becoming a defenseless sot in the hands of your enemies. On the other hand, you will be able to burn up some of the Sake you have drunk to obtain significant bonuses which may well save your life. Show yourself as the wise warrior you are and balance your strategy with care, not burning up too much Sake, thus finding yourself in the rear at the end of the game, when the Masu is empty and the Sudden death round begins. Those who will succumb to their enemies' blows won't be eliminated from the game, but will become Spirits of Enma, the thirsty god of death, and team up with the other Spirits to attack the living, aiming to steal their Sake. Raise your glasses (and your katanas)!&#10;&#10;Sake &amp; Samurai is a board game for 3-8 Players about honor, blood and Sake.

A man (&#208;&#168;&#208;&#176;&#209;&#136;&#208;&#186;&#208;&#176;) moves forwards only, but it can capture forwards and backwards. Men are promoted to kings (&#208;&#148;&#208;&#176;&#208;&#188;&#208;&#186;&#208;&#176;, actually meaning lady) upon reaching the back row. If this happens within a capture, the piece is promoted, too, and must, if possible, carry on capturing as a king. Kings fly in movement and capture. A move may not end when there is still a capture possible, but there is no need to choose the path with the maximum number of captures. The game ends when a player cannot move, either because his pieces are blocked or because he lost them all.&#10;&#10;Shashki was the dominant game in Russia before the rise of Chess. It is still very popular and played in tournaments. There is a plethora of variants, some of which, notably Bashni (column Shashki) and Shashki Poddavki (give-away Shashki), are played in tournaments as well.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Bitter Victory: The Invasion of Sicily, 1943 is a Brigade-level, hex-and-counter wargame covering the 1943 Allied invasion of Sicily.&#10;&#10;The game uses the chit-pull activation system previously employed in America Triumphant, Red God of War and Alsace 1945. Players alternate pulling HQ activation chits and moving/fighting with the corresponding combat units. HQ units must be able to trace supply lines for their units to be able to fight and move at their highest efficiency. The game adds rules for amphibious landings and airborne drops.&#10;&#10;Four scenarios are provided:&#10;&#10;1) Operation Husky -- the historical invasion plan where Monty races to Messina to cut off the German escape while Patton supposedly covers his flank.&#10;&#10;2) A &quot;free setup&quot; scenario where both sides may freely deploy their defenders/choose invasion sites.&#10;&#10;3) What-if scenario &quot;141 Plan&quot; -- Fewer troops are employed than in the historical invasion, and they assault at opposite ends of the island&#10;&#10;4) What-if scenario &quot;Tunisian Followup&quot;--an invasion taking place earlier than the historical landings--immediately following the conquest of North Africa.&#10;&#10;Victory points are earned for eliminating enemy units, repelling and landings and airdrops, evacuating units from Messina, and controlling key cities.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Gathering Storm does for GMT's A World at War what Days of Decision did for ADG's World in Flames. It allows players to simulate the diplomatic, economic, and political maneuverings that preceded the Second World War, either as a stand alone game or as an expansion for A World at War.  (Unlike Days of Decision, Gathering Storm covers only the European events leading to war.)&#10;&#10;&lt;From the publisher's website:&gt;&#10;&#10;Gathering Storm, both a game in its own right and a prequel to GMT&rsquo;s A World at War, covers the period from 1935 to the outbreak of World War II, whenever that might be. Like A World at War, Gathering Storm simulates the military, economic, political, diplomatic, research and production preparations for the Second World War, allowing the players to explore what might have happened if:&#10;&#10;- Admiral Doenitz had convinced his superiors of the importance of submarine warfare in the impending war with Britain.&#10;- Germany had pursued the Z Plan earlier and more consistently.&#10;- The development of the &ldquo;Ural bomber&rdquo; had been pursued.&#10;- Poland had become a German satellite, rather than resisting German aggression.&#10;- War had broken out over the Sudetenland, or even the remilitarization of the Rhineland.&#10;- Mussolini had given a lower priority to naval armaments, to the benefit of the Italian armor and air forces.&#10;- France had extended the Maginot Line.&#10;- de Gaulle&rsquo;s arguments to expand and strengthen France&rsquo;s armor units had been accepted.&#10;- Britain had rearmed sooner.&#10;- Russia had deferred the Great Purges. Or accelerated them.&#10;- The Spanish civil war had been won by the Loyalists.&#10;- A civil war had broken out in Yugoslavia. Or Greece.&#10;- Atomic fission had been discovered earlier.&#10;- The Second World War had begun with a Franco-Italian conflict. Or a French pre-emptive attack on Germany. Or a Russo-German war, with Italy and the Western Allies neutral.&#10;- War comes early. Or later, in 1940 or even 1941. &#10;- YOU had been in command.&#10;&#10;Gathering Storm can be played as a separate game in a single session, with its own victory conditions, but A World at War players will want to press on and see how the war they have created plays out. While using different mechanics, Gathering Storm's structure is consistent with A World at War and allows for a seamless transition to whatever alternate war the players planned &ndash; or stumbled into.  Some 30 years in development, with three years of design and playtesting, Gathering Storm, includes the following:&#10;&#10;- Six random events each turn, providing unlimited replay value.&#10;- Economics based on tiles and activity counters, eliminating any paperwork.&#10;- Flexible mobilization rules, allowing players to emphasis civilian or military production &ndash; each at the expense of the other.&#10;- Unit construction which allows players to activate reserve units for immediate benefits, at a cost of limiting future options.&#10;- Variable research, which can focus on air, naval, military or intelligence projects, as well as short or long term gains.&#10;- A fast-moving diplomatic system, with each player allocating diplomatic counters each turn. Diplomatic targets are public, but the points allocated to them are not.&#10;- Shipbuilding that allows varied fleets, including the possibility of 5-factor super battleships.&#10;- Ahistorical A World at War counters, including armor units of different strengths and additional ships. &#10;- A dynamic crisis system, in which the Allies can appease or oppose the Axis, with neither side necessarily being certain whether war might break out.&#10;- No dice.&#10;&#10;Gathering Storm is a must-buy for any committed A World at War player, an excellent &ndash; and possibly dangerously time consuming &ndash; introduction to the A World at War universe for those unfamiliar with that game, and a enjoyable and instructive fast-paced game all on its own.&#10;&#10;",

You play as poor lads who compete for the favor of the beautiful princess. The winner will be the one who brings her the emerald ring of the Forest Spirit residing in the Roundforest. But the Spirit is only willing to hand over the ring for three golden apples &ndash; and if certain other conditions are also met.&#10;&#10;The task is a challenging one. To begin with, nobody knows where the Forest Spirit is hiding. Then, it is not so easy to find your way in this enchanted forest: whenever you arrive at a clearing (a game space), it makes a quadrant turn clockwise!  This constantly changes players&rsquo; movement options.&#10;&#10;Of course, golden apples are not found in the forest. These are acquired by smart planning and a series of actions. You will collect various objects; use them if needed, trade them with the Fairy, or find a magic well to convert them into something else. This way you may come by some golden apples too. &#10;You will encounter various fairy-tale characters living in the Roundforest, such as a magic steed, a witch, a goblin, a beggar, a wealthy merchant, a puzzled sculptor, a bandit &ndash; or even the Devil itself. Some of these creatures are friendly, while others are hostile, trying to make your life difficult. The former might help you in return for a little favor, and the latter can be defeated if you deal with them the right way.&#10;&#10;The game field is built randomly of 32 octagonal forest tiles. Components include 12 fairy-tale character cards, a large pack of object tokens, action discs, copper and silver coins, a fairy board, personal boards (haversacks) and a draw bag. The game provides approximately 1 hour playing time.

Geography will determine areas of maneuver. Once battle is joined, commanders will have to decide whether to fight, reinforce, or withdraw. Winning or losing one battle may trigger military action on the part of other nations that can help or hurt your cause.&#10;&#10;Command, supply, and technology will all play their respective roles in these wars. Each scenario has specific rules that focus the game system on the military advances and limitations of each of the 5 conflicts. Extensive historical commentary illuminates the importance of the military actions within the politics of 19th Century Europe.&#10;&#10;The armies of 21 nations, large and small, took part in these struggles for continental domination - from France, Prussia, and Austria to Saxe-Meinigen and the Papal States.

    "description": "U.S.S. Freedom is a fun, cooperative, open world, free-roaming, space-themed board game.&#10;&#10;Explore unknown worlds, discover alien civilizations, and decide who will be your ally or your enemy. Perform missions to increase your reputation with your allies while planning for and surviving attacks from numerous other alien races. Upgrading your ship and enhancing your heroes is the key to survival.&#10;&#10;Will you become a space merchant, trading legal&mdash;or even illegal&mdash;commodities? Are you more of a scientist, unraveling the mysteries of strange space phenomena, or maybe a hunter of dangerous monsters living on exotic planets? Will the wealth lure you into becoming a space pirate, ambushing frigates? Or will the irresistible fame from saving entire worlds lead you to engage enemy space monsters? Probably all of the above.&#10;&#10;Sail into the vastness of space aboard the starship Freedom in its three-year quest: A fully replayable campaign that consists of 36 standalone sessions lasting 60 minutes each. In every session, you get to pilot your ship in any direction, so you choose the challenges you will engage and write your own story. No two campaigns are ever the same.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;&#10;In a game session of U.S.S. Freedom, you continue your journey from where you left off the session before&mdash;think of it like watching a single episode of a sci-fi TV series. A game session consists of five phases.&#10;&#10;Interstellar Phase&#10;Set up the Interstellar Board with all the miniatures in their positions from your previous game session. Then, the various Spaceships and Titans move. If they did not move onto the same hex as your ship, then it is time for you to move.&#10;&#10;Navigate Phase&#10;Your ship may move toward any adjacent hex.  Your ship scanners warn you of what lies in all directions. Create the Encounter Deck by shuffling all cards of your level that belong to your adjacent sectors. Then you randomly place one card in each direction. Look at the different Encounters you have and select one to move toward.&#10;&#10;Encounter Phase&#10;After selecting the Encounter you will face, roll the Encounter Roll. If the Encounter is an Alien Colony or Alien Starship, add your Reputation to the result. You then flip the Encounter Card and see how it plays according to the Encounter Result and the nature of your Encounter. Some Aliens may simply attack you while others may offer you Missions.&#10;&#10;Combat Phase&#10;A lot of Encounters will lead to combat, whether through Missions or direct conflict. Some battles will be carried out by the U.S.S. Freedom, while in other cases your heroes will have to fight on the planet surface, in enemy bases, or even inside the U.S.S. Freedom. Sometimes battles may be carried out simultaneously with the U.S.S. Freedom fighting in space while an away team fights a ground battle.&#10;&#10;Each kind of enemy has different abilities that they use during the battle, revealed by flipping the top chip from the stack of Enemy Ability Chips.&#10;&#10;Luckily, your heroes also have abilities. They are used for everything from attacks on the enemies to using skills such as Engineering or Willpower. Heroes use their Aether to activate their abilities. Each player has an Aether Pouch and draws different colored Crystals representing the Aether that empowers the heroes&rsquo; Abilities.&#10;&#10;In space combat, heroes use the Engine to produce Power and distribute it to all decks of the ship. Heroes across the ship use this Power to fly the Starship, attacking with Weapons or raising Shields.&#10;&#10;Conclude Phase&#10;Succeeding enables you to continue your mission. You get rewards according to the Encounter, you may trade commodities, or you may even get to upgrade your ship.&#10;&#10;This will conclude one game session. You may pack everything into your Campaign pouch and continue another day from where you left. Or&hellip;if you have another hour, you could play just one more game session!&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "What if Hitler decided to try again for Moscow during the summer of 1942 rather than plunging the Wehrmacht deep into the Caucasus and Stalingrad as he did historically?&#10;&#10;&quot;Operation Kremlin&quot; uses the corps-army level units that were historically available for this campaign. The German player is on the offensive, seeking to win by controlling Moscow and other key cities. The Soviet player, though mostly defending, must watch for opportunities to deliver counterattacks against the Germans in order to inflict a decisive defeat upon them or upset the Axis alliance. &#10; Operation Kremlin's orders of battle are extrapolated from both sides' historic organizational charts of mid to late 1942. The Germans have the units which composed Army Group Center on 28 June 1942, along with all the panzer corps that were deployed elsewhere on the Russian Front. Manstein's 11th Army enters as reinforcement once Sevastopol falls. The Germans also have the Axis satellite armies, on the assumption that their own governments would have wanted to be able to claim participation in this &quot;final and decisive&quot; campaign in Russia.&#10;&#10;The Soviet order of battle is based on their front line deployment of 28 June, along with all their Operational and Strategic reserves, plus just about everything they generated in the way of replacements and reinforcements during the time period of the historic Stalingrad campaign.&#10;&#10;Each hex represents approximately 10 miles (16.2 kilometers) from side to side. Airpower is represented abstractly, representing the effects of one side or the other having local air superiority. Each full game turn represents one week.&#10;&#10;Operation Kremlin gives wargamers the opportunity to discover what would have happened had the Germans struck for Moscow in 1942. Was this the last great chance for the Third Reich to win in the East? Or would it have led to an even greater &quot;Stalingrad?&quot;&#10;&#10;",

You can use the tool tokens to help you, but their special abilities can be used only once, so use them wisely!
