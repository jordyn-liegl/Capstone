    "description": "Little Wars was first published in 1913, but has been published many times since then, including editions from MacMillan publishing and Dover Press.  The rules portion of the book can be read for free online.&#10;&#10;The full book includes a fairly extensive history of the game and socio-political discussion of wargaming.  Wells (the famous historian and science fiction writer) was a pacifist, and the book makes for interesting reading, as wargaming was his favorite hobby.  He considered the generals he played with to be reckless buffoons, and was worried for his country should war break out.  (WWI broke out the year after the book was published, and given the massive casualties of WWI, he seems justified in his opinions.)&#10;&#10;The rules themselves are fairly simple, as miniatures games go.  There are rules for movement, ranged combat, melee combat, terrain setup, prisoners, etc.  There are three types of units: cavalry, infantry and artillery.  The toy soldiers of Wells' day were fairly large, so the movement factors are also large, and it's made to be played on a floor.&#10;&#10;Ranged combat results are entertaining, but hard to recreate in today's world.  In Wells' time, toy cannons fired little pellets and were actually tooled to be quite accurate.  The game calls for aiming the cannons and firing them, and any figures you knock over are casualties!  The best recreation I've seen was at a convention where we used toy pistols that fired plastic disks: the player had to place the butt of the pistol on the floor next to his artillery and fire from there.&#10;&#10;Melee combat does not use a randomizer.  (In the book Wells discusses how he started with a coin flip but was turned against it when one soldier won over twenty battles!)  Instead, compare sizes of units, add in &quot;supporting&quot; units (within a certain distance), and each side takes casualties proportionately.  The remaining smaller force is then taken prisoner and may be escorted to the rear lines - or freed on the way by a rescue attempt.&#10;&#10;Although modern miniatures rules are more complex and realistic, this is still a very fun game to play, and is a big hit at conventions.  It's also free online!  It is best played on a floor with one-foot tiles for ease of measurement.&#10;&#10;Stand alone expansion of Floor Games&#10;&#10;BGG Microbadge -- &#10;&#10;",

    "description": "A board wargame of the European and North African theaters in World War II. The War (&quot;TW&quot;) is a hex-and-counter strategic-level game which aims to provide the challenge of a monster game with the ease of play of a moderate complexity war game. Experienced players should be able to play a campaign game in a weekend.&#10;&#10;The game includes several scenarios designed to be fun, challenging mini-games in their own right, each playable in an afternoon. An array of variants and optional rules offers enough scope to make TW most replayable.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;(from Compass Games website)The War: Europe 1939-1945 (TW) is Compass Games&rsquo; new WWII strategic level game combining all the best features of the genre into an intuitive, challenging new game. While offering all the expansive features of the WWII Monster Game genre (such as U-Boat warfare, diplomacy, espionage, strategic bombing, jets, rockets and numerous variants for each Major Power), TW also offers tremendous scope in its 12 scenarios (see below).&#10;&#10;Although not a card driven game (and thus a good candidate for solitaire play), TW includes card play for the U-Boat War, Strategic Bombing, Espionage and Counter Espionage and naval warfare. The cards add elements of bluff and surprise more traditional hex-and-combat-table games cannot. But they&rsquo;re optional, so TW can be played solitaire in a way CDG&rsquo;s and block games cannot. Between two (or more) skilled players, no two games are ever likely to be the same. For multiplayer games, up to five gamers can play Campaign Games as Italy, Germany, France, the U.S., Britain and USSR.&#10;&#10;For the hard-core military and naval history buff, TW addresses the details of WWII strategy: what if the Germans really built the carrier Graf Zeppelin; what if Mussolini had upgraded the quality of Italian forces; what if Stalin hadn&rsquo;t shot many of his best generals during the purges; what if the U.S. had entered the war earlier&hellip;or later; what if the British had been able to mobilize the Empire and the Dominions more effectively; what if the U.S. had developed the atomic bomb early enough to use in Europe, and so on.&#10;&#10;Although the game is the result of extensive research by its designer, TW isn&rsquo;t a simulation and isn&rsquo;t intended to be. It&rsquo;s a &quot;gamer&rsquo;s game&quot; with quick, user-friendly combat systems on land, in the air and at sea. Veteran gamers familiar with classic WWII strategic level games should pick up the game very quickly. For new recruits, the short scenarios teach the basics, but can be played as stand-alone games in their own right. Both realistic and playable, TW should present a rewarding challenge for any WWII strategy game buff.&#10;&#10;Scenario List for The War: Europe 1939-1945:&#10;&#10;    1939 Full War Campaign&#10;    1941 Campaign&#10;    1942-43 Turning Point Campaign&#10;    Poland 1939&#10;    Norway 1940&#10;    France 1940&#10;    Barbarossa 1941&#10;    North Africa 1941-43&#10;    The Atlantic Lifeline 1939-45&#10;    Bolshevik Hordes 1944-45&#10;    Regia Marina&#10;    D-Day to VE Day 1944-45&#10;&#10;&#10;Complexity: High (about 8 out of 10)&#10;Playing Time: 50 hours for full campaign (1.5 hours and up for scenarios)&#10;Solitaire Suitability: Good&#10;&#10;Designer: Ernie Copley&#10;Developer: Paul Shackleton&#10;Artist: Mark Mahaffey&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;    2 maps&#10;    9 full sheets of 5/8&rdquo; counters&#10;    Approximately 20 full color 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; cards with various displays, tracks, reminders, tables, charts, worksheets, etc.&#10;    1 rules booklet&#10;    1 scenario booklet&#10;    1 deck of variant cards&#10;    2 dice&#10;    1 full color box and lid &ndash; the big 3&rdquo; deep box&#10;&#10;&#10;",

These cards include icons representing different treasure items. Whoever first notices which icon is repeated the most times on these revealed cards needs to name this item out loud; if they're correct, that player collects all of the cards played by the players. If more than one icon is present multiple times, then the player who grabs the chest first gets the cards.&#10;&#10;Dragons are sometimes hidden in the graphics of the cards. When one of those cards is revealed, everybody needs to put their hand on top of the shield. The last one to do so must pay all of the cards they have collected so far that include the symbols indicated in the dragon's card. However, that player can avoid making this payment by producing a chicken card since dragons love chicken and are happy to forfeit all treasure as long as they can get a tasty meal.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, whoever has the most treasure cards in their stash wins!&#10;&#10;",

The ore has to be transported initially by lorries and also later by barges to the coastal warehouse.  All transport has to be hired and there is always less transport available than required, favouring those who are prepared to take a risk on achieving a quick journey without mishap.  For example there are only 5 barges (always one less than the numbers of players) to encourage competition and load sharing.  You can also force other players to pay you for taking their ore to make up a barge load as all barges have to travel fully laden.  Much depends on how long a journey takes.  New ore can only be obtained by throwing a 1 or a six which also triggers the playing of a production card which can be favourable or not.&#10;&#10;From the coastal warehouse, barges and ships are used to transport ore out to sea to foreign ports to sell to gradually earn the Million Dollars needed to win the game.  The second set of money (dollars) is thus actually a victory point counting device and not actual currency (i.e. it cannot be spent).&#10;&#10;It works well with any number of players (when playing with a smaller complement, each player operates multiple mines) except five, as the competition factor on one side of the board is uneven with the other.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Great War at Sea series.&#10;&#10;From &quot;Avalanche Press&quot; Website:&#10;&#10;During the early decades of the Twentieth Century, the United States Navy made plans to fight a host of potential enemies. Some of these future wars seemed inevitable, particularly that with Japan. Others depended on changes in current politics, but Navy planners wanted to be prepared just in case.&#10;&#10;One of these plans, labeled &ldquo;Gold,&rdquo; studied a potential naval war with France. The United States had stood alongside its &ldquo;oldest ally&rdquo; during the First World War, but in the years immediately afterwards the Navy looked at the potential for radical politicians to change France from friend to foe. Also, the peace negotiations which followed the war revealed deep underlying tensions between the Americans and their European allies; some of the more paranoid came to believe the next war would be between Europe and America.&#10;&#10;U.S. Navy Plan Gold is based on these plans. American officers believed the seat of conflict would be the same as that of the undeclared naval war against France in the 1790s: the Caribbean Basin.&#10;&#10;U.S. Navy Plan Gold includes the ships projected by the Armee Navale but never built due to the Washington Naval Treaty: the large Gilles and Durand-Viel battle cruisers, Normandie and Lyon class battleships, and the very odd &ldquo;croiseur de combat&rdquo; battleship/carrier design. And of course the Americans receive a number of new ships, such as the &ldquo;alternate Omaha&rdquo; large scout cruiser design.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Is it possible to escape by boat when a shipwreck occurs? The difference between sinking, swimming, and safely making it to an island may be just a vote away!&#10;&#10;Gameplay in Lifeboats: Plank of Carneades is all about voting, which takes the form of both co-operation and betrayal over the course of play as circumstances change and you find your sailors on the brink of death. During a vote, each player chooses a card from their hand, then everyone reveals their choices at the same time. You have one card of each boat color &mdash; which also correspond to the player colors &mdash; as well as three captain cards. If you're the only person to play a captain card during a vote, you get to decide the result...but if more than one captain card is played, they're ignored. In either case, each captain card can be played only once.&#10;&#10;To set up, take turns placing your officers and sailors in empty spaces on several lifeboats, each of which is heading toward a particular island. The game then proceeds in multiple rounds, with the lead player position rotating each round. Whenever a vote is tied, the lead player breaks the tie.&#10;&#10;First, players vote on which ship springs a leak. Whichever color boat receives the most votes has an empty space filled with a water token &mdash; and if the boat has no empty spaces, the players on this boat vote to determine which occupant will be thrown overboard to the sharks to keep the boat from sinking. In this type of vote, officers are worth two votes, sailors only one. However, if a ship has more leaks than occupants, it sinks and everyone on board turns into shark chum.&#10;&#10;Second, players vote on which ship moves forward one space toward its island. If the ship reaches the island, all of its occupants are safe and will score their player points based on which island was reached.&#10;&#10;Third, players scramble to find better chances for survival. Starting with the lead player, each player removes one of their officers or sailors from their respective boat, placing its token behind the boat. Only one occupant can jump from each ship, so a player late in the round might not have to put someone in the water. Then in reverse order, players move their token to an empty space on a different ship...and if the swimmer can't do this because all seat are full, glub glub glub.&#10;&#10;Keep playing until all officers and sailors are either safe or dead, then determine who saved the most valuable crew.&#10;&#10;Lifeboats: Plank of Carneades differs from Lifeboats in that it allows for up to seven players to fight for seats on ships. In addition, in some circumstances the ships will move faster and more ships will spring a leak, making gameplay move faster. Finally, the captain card is more powerful as players can use it to keep any ship from springing a leak in a round.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Napoleonic 20 #18&#10;&#10;Following his failed invasion of Portugal in 1810, French Marshal Andr&eacute; Mass&eacute;na fell back into Spain with Wellington's Anglo-Portuguese Army in cautious pursuit. Assuming the wretched state of the French would allow him time to capture the key border fortress of Almeida, Wellington settled in for a leisurely siege. But Mass&eacute;na quickly reorganized his forces and advanced on the British positions in an effort to resupply the beleaguered fortress.&#10;&#10;Advancing on Almeida on 3 May, 1811, Mass&eacute;na encountered Wellington's army in strong defensive positions along the Dos Casas River. Heavy fighting erupted, with the British barely managing to hang on to the key terrain. The next day, Mass&eacute;na scouted the area and discovered that the British right was dangerously weak; that evening he conducted a daring night march that put strong forces into position to roll up Wellington's flank. When the French attack struck on the morning of 5 May, the British right nearly collapsed, and only the sacrifice of the British cavalry and heroic performance of Craufurd's Light Division barely managed to save the day. The savage nature of the fighting and the peril to the British position was revealed in Wellington's statement after the battle, &quot;If Boney had been there, we should have been beaten.&quot;&#10;&#10;Fuentes de O&ntilde;oro 20, by designers R. Nicasio Garcia and Jack Gill, allows players to examine this tension-filled battle of the Peninsular Campaign, fought along the Spanish-Portuguese Border. Featuring the same system as GMT's popular &quot;Fading Glory&quot; game, Fuentes de O&ntilde;oro 20 has low unit density (20 pieces or less on the game map) and modest complexity. The game focuses on dramatic, fast-playing turns and creates a strong historical narrative through the use of random event cards and the tracking of army morale providing a great feel for the parry-and-thrust of Napoleonic grand battle. Lead your troops forward into action to see if you can break your opponent's morale at bayonet-point before he puts your army to flight.&#10;&#10;Game Data:&#10;Complexity: 5 on a 9 scale&#10;Solitaire Suitability: 7 on a 9 scale&#10;Scale: Each unit is 1 division, each hex is 1 mile from end to end, and each turn roughly 3-4 hours of real time.&#10;&#10;",

The team with the most points after three rounds advances to the &quot;Winners Circle&quot; round.&#10;&#10;In the &quot;Winners Circle&quot; one teammate must make a list of items which fit each of six different categories.

The first three games were $10,000, with the Third Edition later repackaged as $20,000 with slightly different artwork to accommodate the change. The eighth game used $50,000, per the brief 1981 series.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "The Cold War Battles game system is a grand tactical simulation of battles that were fought&mdash;or could have been fought&mdash;during the Cold War. The playing pieces represent the actual units that participated or could have participated.&#10;&#10;Two games included in this issue are: BUDAPEST 1956, covering the ill-fated rebellion in the Hungarian capital in late 1956; and BLITZKRIEG ANGOLA, the clashes between Cuban and South African mechanized forces in Angola in 1987 and 1988.&#10;&#10;There are two players in each game. In BUDAPEST 1956 one player controls the Hungarian Rebels and possible NATO &quot;what-if&quot; reinforcements, the other controls the forces of the Warsaw Pact. In BLITZKRIEG ANGOLA one player controls the South Africans and their UNITA allies, the other the Cuban and MPLA forces.&#10;&#10;In the Budapest game each hexagon on the map represents half a kilometer across, and each game turn represents one day. Soviet maneuver units are mostly battalions, with regiments for their artillery and assault guns; Hungarian rebel units are ad hoc groups; and NATO intervention, when playing that special alternative history scenario, are represented by US &quot;Pentomic&quot; battlegroups.&#10;&#10;In the Angola game each hexagon on the map represents eight kilometers across, while each turn represents anywhere from one week of intensive combat to four weeks of refitting. Units on both sides are mainly battalions or equivalent groups of irregulars.&#10;&#10;The game system is low-complexity (totaling about 13,000 words) and compares to the one used in last year's Middle East Battles: Suez &#039;56 &amp; El Arish &#039;67. There are 280 NATO-style (with some iconic) half-inch counters. Playing time between two experienced opponents of roughly equal skill levels will be about three hours per game. Designed by Joseph Miranda.&#10;&#10;Cold War Battles: Budapest '56 &amp; Angola '87 was published in Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #235.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "On 9 September 1940, the Italian 10th Army marched across the Egyptian frontier with visions of Roman glory quickening their step. Six months later, General Erwin Rommel would push German troops to restore all that the Italians lost, and then capture those parts of Egypt that were part of the original Axis plan. The British and their Commonwealth allies recovered and twice forced Rommel back to his starting point. The armies of both sides maneuvered and intertwined in ferocious battles at soon to become famous locations, including Tobruk, Gazala, Halfaya Pass, Buq Buq, El Alamein and others. The pace of mechanized warfare would sweep the Western Desert no less than 5 times in what would be defined as the most elastic theater of operations in WWII, where supply drove the tempo, and the open flank beckoned one more offensive!&#10;&#10;Desert Victory: North Africa, 1940-1942 is a low-complexity, high-detailed wargame set in eastern Libya and western Egypt during the formative years of WWII. Following on the heels of Battle for Kursk: The Tigers are Burning, 1943 found in C3iNr34, it is the second volume of the C3i Combined Arms Series and uses many of the same mechanics. In DV players manage their supplies and maneuver their forces to achieve victory in a game where both sides rapidly switch between offense and defense. Not familiar with the Western Desert campaign? No problem, as the Turn Record Track shows exactly what happened historically, allowing players to learn history and compare their game progress to actual results. Of paramount importance is the capture of coastal towns that allow a side to move their Supply Head forward to enable more efficient movement and combat. Furthermore, displacing an opponent&rsquo;s Supply Head may frustrate their plans and capture much needed fuel. Supply, reinforcements, and replacements are all set at historical levels, and it&rsquo;s up to the players to assess the correlation of forces and decide the opportune moment to press forward in search of the elusive automatic win; can you formulate a plan to achieve Desert Victory before your offensive power expires?&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Units: Brigade, Division or Corps &#10;Map: 1 Hex = 25 miles &#10;Turns: Quarterly Turns (three months per turn)&#10;Playing Time: 2 to 3 hours&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "World War 2 was the largest and most violent extended naval war in history. From September 1939 until the surrender of Japan, the high seas were a global battle zone filled with mighty battleships, nimble cruisers, silent hunters, and flat-tops bristling with planes. Before our eyes, we witnessed the changing of warfare on the high seas as the thunderous old guard fell to air power and submarine Raiders prowled the open waters and the carrier showed its true diversity and adaptability.&#10;&#10;Seas of Thunder not only allows players to re-create the Atlantic or Pacific theaters of the war but to see how challenging the entire picture was for their leaders. How do you protect a globe from German raiders? How desperate was it for Britain when France fell and they were left to fight Germany and Italy alone on the high seas? What is the right balance for the Soviet fleet split between four distinct fronts (Baltic, Black Sea, Arctic, and Pacific)? If the Mediterranean force weakens for the allies, from where do they draw ships? Does Japan strike quickly or play for attrition when they arrive on the halfway point? Will America fight in two fronts, three, or four?&#10;&#10;In Seas of Thunder, players will experience the tension of too much sea to cover with too few ships, the frustration of being caught unprepared, or the intensity of a vital stand contesting a high-value sea area. Victory is neither sudden nor guaranteed. In each battle, a flight of Catalinas, the lack of ASW, the improper distribution of air power, or even a missing minesweeper could be the difference between success or failure.&#10;&#10;What's in the Box&#10;&#10;Seas of Thunder may not have every ship in the conflict, but it has the ones you know.&#10;&#10;1 Mounted Map (Double-Sided with pre-Pearl Harbor scoring on one side and post-Pearl Harbor scoring on the other)&#10;&#10;1200+ Combat Ship counters (Capital ships down to Destroyer Squadrons, Submarine Grops, and Mine-sweeping Flotillas)&#10;&#10;132 Convoy &amp; Utility counters&#10;&#10;14 Port Cards (1 per side for each of 7 scenarios)&#10;&#10;Combat Sequence Cards for tracking combat&#10;&#10;Plus sundry dice, rules, scenario details...the usual.&#10;&#10;Seas of Thunder is every bit a full-force strategic-level representation of the conflict on the high seas during World War 2. Players have to manage a global disposition of their warships with frequently too much ocean to cover and not nearly enough ships to cover it.&#10;&#10;Each nation has access to the historical ships that sailed in the conflict. Each country's fleets have advantages and disadvantages that are unique to them.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The game also includes dissertation cards that show various combinations of cards: numerical straights of length 5, 7, 9, and 11; three pairs; four pairs; three- or five-of-a-kind; and so on, with multiple copies of some dissertations. Players are dealt 3-5 cards based on player order, with everyone then discarding down to three cards in hand.&#10;&#10;On a turn, take one of three possible actions:&#10;&#10;&bull; Research: Either draw two cards, add one to your hand, then discard the other; or add the top card of the discard pile to your hand.&#10;&bull; Present a dissertation: Take cards from your hand that satisfy the requirements of a dissertation, then place those cards on display in front of you, placing the dissertation on top. You can claim a specific dissertation at most once.&#10;&bull; Conduct a peer review: Select a published dissertation (from any player) that has two or more cards underneath it, then add one of the cards to your hand. If a dissertation has only one card underneath it, the paper has been accepted and (1) it is now worth points for its author and (2) it can be cited by future dissertations.&#10;&#10;How do you cite an accepted dissertation? You present a new dissertation and pretend that the card under the accepted dissertation is one of the cards that you played; you can cite multiple cards in a dissertation, but you must play at least one card from your hand. For example, you can play two pairs of cards from your hand, say 3s and 8s, then &quot;cite&quot; a 6 from one of your accepted dissertations and a different 6 from another player's dissertation. You'd then claim the &quot;three pairs&quot; dissertation and place only the 3s and 8s underneath it. When you cite another player's dissertation, you must give them a card from your hand &mdash; ideally something useless! &mdash; as a thank you for their previous work.&#10;&#10;Accepted dissertations are worth 1-9 points, and when a player has 15+ points, the end of the game is signaled. If this player has any cards in hand, they claim the &quot;end flag&quot; dissertation that's worth 1 point, then place one card from their hand underneath it. (If they have no cards, the game end is still triggered; they just miss out on the bonus point.) Continue play until each other player has completed two turns and the person who triggered the ending has completed one turn. The player with the most points from accepted dissertations wins; in the event of a tie, the tied player with the fewest accepted dissertations wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "From the Avalanche Press website:&#10;&#10;At the turn of the last century, South America seemed poised to make the same economic leap as the northern half of the hemisphere. Fueled by booming exports of grain, cattle, coffee and rubber, Brazil and Argentina saw their economies grow rapidly and at one time both stood among the world's ten wealthiest nations.  All that cash led their leaders to seek the prestige symbols of the day: dreadnought battleships. Argentina, Brazil and Chile all built dreadnoughts just like the Great Powers, but none of them ever fired a shot at a foreign enemy.&#10;&#10;Cone of Fire is a boxed game for both the Second World War at Sea and Great War at Sea series. The fleets of Argentina, Brazil and Chile plus those of Peru and Uruguay are added to both series, along with ships from Germany, France and Britain. Most of the scenarios, or game situations, are based on hypothetical situations arising from the actual war scares between the South American nations and sometimes European interlopers, and the war plans with which they addressed them.  There are also scenarios based on the actual conflicts which took place in South American waters: the hunt for Admiral Maximilian Graf von Spee's German cruiser squadron in 1914, and the hunt for the cruiser that bore his name 25 years later.&#10;&#10;Alongside the ships actually operated by the South American naval powers, there are also ships they ordered and did not receive, or contemplated but did not order. The Brazilians have several projected classes of battleships that they never completed, as well as the modern warships they sought from the U.S. Navy during World War II. Argentina and Chile have their projected battleships, carriers and cruisers as well. And there are the actual jet aircraft flown by Argentina and Brazil.&#10;&#10;There are six maps, three at Second World War at Sea scale, and three at Great War at Sea scale. These cover the region from south of Tierra del Fuego, the southernmost tip of the Americas, to well north of Rio de Janeiro. There are huge stretches of ocean as well as the narrow, winding channels of the Chilean coast.&#10;&#10;",

You can earn points through saving passengers and playing star cards - but you won't know what cards you'll get until you draw them. The game ends when the Titanic is completely flooded, and the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "It's OGRE implemented in Diceland!&#10;&#10;The game consists of one 4-inch die (the Ogre Cybertank) and a set of 16 smaller dice representing lesser units. One side plays the Ogre; the other side picks 30+X points of units, where X is the cost of the smallest unit.&#10;Each turn (starting with the non-Ogre player - call them the Defender), the player may either activate a die on the table or throw a new die onto the table and immediately activate it. Each die has 8 sides with variable levels of attack and defense, as well as special powers. Facing matters when attacking, but range only matters if one potential target is closer than another.&#10;When a die attacks: if its Attack value is greater than the target's Defense value, the target die is destroyed and the player scores its point value. If the Attack Value is lower (even an Attack of 1 agains the Ogre's 40+), the target shifts one side (effectively losing 1 of its 1d8 hit points).&#10;Instead of attacking, a die can move, rotating on its edge for a better firing position or to expose a better face. The Ogre can both fire and then move, making it hard to kill.&#10;If the Defender can get several dice on the table, they have a Command Post which can activate every die, bringing the Ogre down quickly. The Ogre also has a 'systems card' like the old Steve Jackson game, allowing its weapons and treads to be attacked.&#10;The winner is the first to score 50 points; the Ogre is worth 50 points and the Command Post isn't worth any (destroying it is not the goal).&#10;&#10;List of Diceland sets and armies&#10;&#10;Related to the Game: Ogre / G.E.V..&#10;&#10;",

Are you ready to make some macarons?&#10;&#10;In the 1-5 player trick-taking game Macaron, players are French p&acirc;tissiers preparing macaron gift boxes.

Players receive victory points (VPs) at the end of the round based on the number of boxes prepared.&#10;&#10;In more detail, the deck will contain 5-7 suits of macarons based on the number of players, and these macarons are put together into 3-4 groups, e.g., almond and pistachio are in group A, while strawberry and blueberry are in group B. Each round, one group will be determined to be &quot;royal&quot;, and the 1-2 suits in that group are trump for the round. In addition, one flavor (not group) of macarons will be the allergen for the round.&#10;&#10;Standard trick-taking rules are used, with the leading player being allowed to play anything and with other players needing to follow suit. Whoever wins the trick scores 1 box &mdash; or 3 boxes if the trick was won with a 1.

Players track boxes won on a scoring track, and they also use this board at the start of a round to bet on the number of tricks they expect to win, with players winning or losing points based on how well their bet matches reality.&#10;&#10;Macaron lasts a number of rounds until someone passes the VP threshold established at the start of the game.

Le Mans offers the choice of twelve different car specifications that detail the number of spaces the car travels in each gear and which gears the cars can safely negotiate turns.  Also, the different car types have different braking characteristics.&#10;&#10;The game includes two tracks printed on the same board, Monte Carlo and Le Mans.  Each track is only two lanes wide, and the spaces on the track are only a half-car-length, so a car takes up two spaces at once.&#10;&#10;The cars move in order of track position. Each turn, a car may either remain in the same gear, shift up one gear, or shift down according to the car's specifications.  It must then move the exact number of spaces required by the particular model of car in the specified gear.&#10;&#10;When cornering, if a car exceeds the gear specified for the particular model of car, it must &quot;take a chance.&quot;  The driver must roll the die to determine if the car safely cornered, spun out, crashed, or damaged the car such that a pit stop is required.  If a car spins out, a &quot;wet track&quot; marker is placed on the corner, subsequently requiring all cars to roll for a chance when going through it.&#10;&#10;If a car is blocked and cannot move the entire number of spaces required (and the car has no more hard braking left and cannot down shift enough), the cars collide.  Collisions require that the involved cars make a pit stop for repairs.&#10;&#10;Optional rules include guidelines for slipstreaming, over-revving to move an extra space, and details of team, solo, and timed play, and &quot;Le Mans-style&quot; starts.&#10;&#10;The game is a revised version of Wright-Mudge Enterprises' Grand Prix: A Sports Car Racing Game.&#10;&#10;",

The Standish cannot escape from this haunted house and will be the collateral damage of the conflict.&#10;&#10;In Phantom, the four areas of the house &ndash; Garden, Basement, Ground Floor and First Floor &ndash; are placed in a line, with the areas divided into two sides. Each player controls Ghosts in half of the house, and he must make Spectres, Souls and other Spirits appear in front of the different areas of the house in order to frighten the Occupants before the other player. Each turn, a player can play a card &ndash; Ghost or Place &ndash; in order to increase the Scare level of his corresponding apparition; each Place card must be played in front of its corresponding area(s); for example, the Attic must be played in the First Floor,while  the Stairs can be played either in the First Floor or in the Ground Floor. (Note: In Europe, the first floor is customarily the initial floor above ground level, while in the U.S. the floor at ground level is the first floor.)&#10;&#10;The Ghost cards can be played in front of any areas. Each of them creates a special effect:&#10;&#10;&#10;    The Squatter takes a Place from the opponent's apparition.&#10;    The Charmer makes an Occupant come in the area.&#10;    The Howler puts Occupants off the area.&#10;    The Knocker discards a Ghost from the opponent's apparition.&#10;    The Queen takes a Ghost of his family from the opponent's apparitions.&#10;    The Invoker gets a Ghost back from the discard pile.&#10;&#10;&#10;Unfortunately for you, the adults of the family can kill off some vulnerable Ghosts, and a family of Ghosts is vulnerable to each of the adults. Some Places protect the Ghosts from the adults.&#10;&#10;At the end of a player's turn, the Scare level of the apparitions in the different areas are compared to the Fear threshold of any Occupants located there. When a player's Scare level is higher or equal to the Fear threshold of an Occupant who is alone in the corresponding area, this player takes this Occupant and wins the corresponding Victory points. After his turn, the player draws Ghost/Place cards until he has five cards in hand.&#10;&#10;Each adult is worth 3 victory points (VPs), each child 2 VPs, the baby 4 VPs, and the Priest adds 1 VP to the last Occupant of the house.

The only way to remove a block is when it is rolled star side up onto the star space at the opposite side of the board.&#10;&#10;On each turn, a player will move in 2 steps: To begin your turn, tip one of your blocks into any open adjacent space. You may not roll diagonally, and you may not roll into the star space. After tipping, you must hop that same block according to the symbol that lands face-up after the roll. You may only hop onto open spaces.&#10;&#10;Each block has six different symbols on each side which signify different movements. The Star: the Star symbol may NOT be rolled face-up anywhere on the board except onto the star space at the opposite side of the board. The Stop:if the stop sign is rolled face-up, the turn is over and the block does not hop to any other spaces. The Cross: when the Cross is rolled face-up, the block hops one space in any vertical or horizontal direction. The X: when the X is rolled face-up, the block hops one space in any diagonal direction. The Slider: when the Slider is rolled face-up, it must slide in any vertical or horizontal direction until it is stopped by another block or the edge of the board. The Hoops: when the Hoops are rolled face-up, the block may hop in any combination of 3 horizontal or vertical steps. The block may even hop back to a space it has previously occupied.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",

The deck consists of seven different types of cards, with each type represented by a girl with numbers 1&ndash;7 and a special power. Players start with a hand of cards, and each round play any number of identical cards from hand, activate that girl's special power, then collect new cards, using a weird drafting mechanism.&#10;&#10;Each player can play a certain numbered set only once per game. When the game ends, the player who has played the most cards of a certain girl &quot;becomes&quot; that girl. Each different girl has a completely different way of scoring, so you need to adapt to the other player's play rapidly.&#10;&#10;(The title is an allusion to a novel set in a distant future in which girls around the world start manifesting supernatural powers, and they are more or less treated as threats to humanity.)&#10;&#10;",

Shuffle the dice cards, then deal two to each player. On a turn, a player plays one die card (which shows values from 1 to 6), then either starts a new row of cards or adds to an existing row.&#10;&#10;&#10;    To start a new row, take the card showing this number from the display and place it in front of you; when starting a row, you can choose to play both die cards instead of only one.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    To add to a row, add the die value played to the number on the top card of one of your rows, then take this card from the display.&#10;&#10;&#10;If another player has used a desired card in one of her rows, steal it from her row and use it for yourself. You can have at most three rows in progress. At the end of your turn draw back up to two die cards.&#10;&#10;When you play a die card to place the 40 card on a row, you then score the row, earning one point for each card in the row plus one point for each star on cards in that row. Record this score on paper, then return these cards to the display.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player scores 30, 35, or 40 points, with this total being dependent on the number of players: 2, 3, or 4.&#10;&#10;",

Let's have flowers on the mountain and sheep at the houses, while laying rails to link people in villages with the most prosperous village being named after the flower Alpenzian.&#10;&#10;Alpenzian is a reimplementation of the game Sunflower Valley, with this re-design originating from the Japanese publisher's discussions with designer Wouter van Strien.

Draw pictures on your player sheet according to the icons on your chosen dice rolls, and gradually build up your village with flowers on the mountains and rails linked all over the place. After all the players have filled their player sheets (i.e., their villages), they tally their score, which depends on the combinations of icons.&#10;&#10;Aside from the score, it is most important for each player to complete and build their wonderful village.

Patrons are placed and move through the park based on ride exits, and each patron generates money for the different ride owners. Using the unique abilities of rides and park improvements, players move patrons, block exits, and most importantly, add danger in the form of vomit, pests, flooding, electrical failure, and more in order to influence die rolls. High rolls show satisfaction and keep patrons on rides. Low rolls create additional danger and force patrons out to other rides. Additionally, insurance policies can be taken to benefit from certain poor outcomes, encouraging direct sabotage for profit. When the park finally closes due to poor quality, rides closing, or patron injury, the player with the most money wins.&#10;&#10;Take the biggest risk, snatch the biggest reward, and get away with it in Danger Park!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

A road which has as many lanes as contestants is constructed from a number of gray road tiles. Each turn, players select a card from 2 to 10, which is the number of spaces they're moving. After these are revealed remembering that players cannot duplicate a card played by someone previous, players move forward down the road. Each of the cards allows for a certain number of road tile placements from your supply, a number of maneuvers per turn, and the damage your current speed will inflict should you careen into another car. Additionally, a percent of the tiles have special actions associated with them, which give the car on them the ability to jump, or hit a semi-truck, or skid out of control, or just plain slow down 'cuz there's a Smokey comin' on his flipside... The game is over when a car reaches the edge of the table, which gives the game a variable ending. Plus if ever a group of cars pulls out to a six-space lead, then all trailing cars are eliminated.&#10;&#10;",

Aunque la guerra se desarroll&oacute; en varias regiones de Espa&ntilde;a, Pa&iacute;s Vasco, Navarra, Catalu&ntilde;a, Arag&oacute;n y Valencia, en este juego s&oacute;lo se representa la que tuvo lugar en el Norte.&#10;Un jugador llevar&aacute; el bando Isabelino formado por cinco facciones: Guardia Real, Ejercito Regular, Milicias, Chapelgorris y Legi&oacute;n Extranjera.&#10;Y el otro jugador llevar&aacute; el bando Carlista formado a su vez por cinco facciones: &Aacute;lava, Castilla, Guipuzcoa, Navarra y Vizcaya.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer (Spanish)&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Light Hunters: Battalion of Darkness is a Heroic Fantasy card game, for 2-8 players, opposing two teams and for everyone. Form your battalions, choose your heroes, and crush the opposite team to return to the Light!&#10;&#10;Story&#10;&#10;Mighty heroes from a far-off land, now exiled to this dark forest, you once shone bright amongst your fellow men, but are now doomed to roam the darkness. Surrounded by crooks, you now seek the former glory of your past.&#10;&#10;Show the true hero you are, and regain your freedom at last. There still remains a glimmer of hope for you to return to your native land. Join forces with other heroes, and lead your camp to victory.Summon the spirits of light, and harness their energy. Fulfil your destiny, and destroy the enemy battalion. Once victorious, you may finally return to your people.&#10;&#10;Far from your prison, the gods will forgive you at last.&quot;&#10;&#10;How to Play&#10;&#10;&#10;     Set up&#10;&#10;&#10;Constitute 2 teams, and place them face to face. Each player can use one or several heroes, the total number of heroes of each team must be equivalent.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Progression of the Game&#10;&#10;&#10;Light Hunters is a turn-based card game in which the possibilities increase as the game progresses. Each round is equivalent to its Ether level: 1st round = Ether level at 1, 2nd round = Ether level at 2, up to 5 max.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Progression of a Hero Round&#10;&#10;&#10;During a round every hero plays 1 time. To play a skill of a hero we have to refer to the Spirits of Light cards and to the Ether level available for the round. We can choose to play or not, if we choose to play for the round, we have to evoke the skill used on the opposite team and discard one or several Spirits of Light cards consumed.&#10;&#10;The round of the hero is then finished, it belongs to the following hero to begin his turn. When all the heroes have played, we moved on the next round by increasing the Ether level +1.&#10;&#10;End of the Game&#10;&#10;When a battalion killed the enemy camp, it gains the victory. All the heroes from the remaining battalion is then indicated winners, and worthy to get back to their world, free and full of glory.&#10;&#10;Content of the Game&#10;&#10;8 &quot;Hero&quot; cards + 1 &quot;Skeleton&quot; card&#10;70 Spirits of Light cards&#10;&#10;     24 Dawn cards&#10;     16 Shimmer cards &#10;     14 New day cards&#10;     12 Beam cards&#10;     4 Illumination cards&#10;&#10;&#10;40 tokens&#10;&#10;     20 1-point health tokens&#10;     10 3-point health tokens&#10;     10 5-point health tokens&#10;&#10;&#10;Rules booklet&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Each Anno Domini set consists of 336 cards, with a description of a historical event on one side of the card, and the year (and sometimes specific date) in which it happened on the other.&#10;&#10;Each player receives nine of these cards (or less, if you want the game to be shorter), and may only look at the descriptions. Players then put in turn a card on the table, *trying* to put theirs in chronological order. A player may, instead of adding a card, claim that the order in which the cards were put is incorrect. In this case all cards are turned over and the correct years revealed.&#10;If the order was correct then the doubting player receives two cards and skips a turn. If the order was incorrect then the previous player, who accepted the order as correct, receives three cards. The first player that gets rid of all the cards wins.&#10;&#10;Bluffing is as least as important as knowledge in this game. Most events are rather obscure or are hard to date exactly, so this ain&rsquo;t no game for the nerds/geeks of this world, even they might think so, because it&rsquo;s full of surprises and pure fun. Highly Recommended, because Anno Domini is a blast to play, is a very enjoyable social event and you even learn something from it.&#10;&#10;Unfortunately there is no English edition in existence, but this game could be a good way, to improve your already existing German skills or a very good reason, to learn German language in the first place.&#10;&#10;The Set &quot;Anno Domini - Gesundheit und Ern&auml;hrung &quot; contains historical events related to things that went wrong completely. It can be played as a standalone or together with the other sets, which is the best way of playing it.&#10;&#10;Part of the Anno Domini series&#10;&#10;",
