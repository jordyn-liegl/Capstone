    "description": "In the abstract strategy game Rondo, players try to score as many points as possible by placing tokens on numbered spaces on the game board, with the board consisting of two concentric rings of numbered spaces and multiple spokes connecting these rings and the center of the board. (The game board is double-sided, with different values on each side.) The numbers come in five colors, and players start the game by drawing two tokens (also in five colors) from a bag and placing them on a rack, thereby hiding the color of the tokens from other players.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player can either (1) play as many tokens as they want in a continuous chain, with the first token being placed next to an occupied space or the center space, then drawing one token from the bag or (2) drawing two tokens and placing none on the board. A player can hold at most five tokens on their rack.&#10;&#10;When a player places tokens, the color of the token must match the space being covered; immediately score the points shown on this space. A player can choose to place a non-matching token face down on a space in order to reach another space, but they score no points for the face-down token. Alternatively, a player can play multiple tokens of the same color on a matching space and score the listed number of points for each token placed.&#10;&#10;The game board has a number of dark grey spaces on it. The game ends at the end of the round in which all of these spaces are occupied or a player cannot draw enough tokens to complete their turn. The player with the most points wins!&#10;&#10;",

Set hundreds of years in the future in a time when competition will move mankind forward, but when collaboration is also sometimes necessary. In Solar Sphere, each player commands a mothership. Their primary task is to build a dyson sphere. But, with crew to hire and aliens attacking the sphere, there are many other ways to earn prestige and become the saviour of mankind.&#10;&#10;In this dice placement game, players can manipulate their dice using drones.

Players can always recycle used drones to get them back into their supply. Or, spend them for instant benefits.&#10;&#10;Players simultaneously start the turn by rolling their dice. Dice act as spacecraft and are sent, in player order, to locations to gather resources, build the dyson sphere, build or recycle drones, upgrade worker spots, hire crew, and fight off aliens.&#10;&#10;Crew come with their own unique benefits that will help players in a variety of areas. Chain crew abilities together to build a good engine, and retire them for extra benefits.

Deciding to mine marble (to get more money) will also help other players because they'll earn money too through their houses next to mines. Building pillars in temples or raising a statue are the only type of actions you'll perform by yourself, but at the end of the game all players might score points because of your work.&#10;&#10;Strategically build your settlements on the island to gain the most profit from quarries.

In the game, you take control of a small group of American soldiers. Under your command, the Americans must fend off the relentless attacks from German paratroopers and fusiliers. Your goal is to recreate the incredible historic accomplishment of the American soldiers by defending the town of Lanzerath, Belgium and delaying the advance of an entire SS Panzer Division.&#10;&#10;Lanzerath Ridge is the next design in the Valiant Defense series, following the critically acclaimed Pavlov's House (2018), Castle Itter (2019), and Soldiers in Postmen's Uniforms (2021).  The Valiant Defense series allows you to play amazing stories of  courage, with small forces holding the line against unimaginable odds.  Games in the series focus on the individual defenders and are deeply  rooted in history, while providing a quick play experience with a light complexity rule set.&#10;&#10;Lanzerath Ridge is divided into four attack periods, each of which is represented by a deck of enemy cards. Each attack period is divided into a number of turns, and each turn consists of two phases:&#10;&#10;The game ends immediately if the defenders&rsquo; morale drops to 0 or if a German attacker takes over an American defensive position. Otherwise, the game ends after the last attack. Your level of success is based on the Americans&rsquo; morale, intelligence gained during the defense, and any objectives you accomplish.&#10;&#10;",

Russia declares enough is enough, decides on war with NATO, and invades the Baltics and Poland. Belarus, knowing where it's bread is buttered, joins in.  Some NATO nations rush to the rescue while others debate the issue. Once again, Europe trembles to the rumble of tank treads and marching boots&hellip;&#10;&#10;Next War: Poland, the fourth volume in GMT's Next War Series. This game moves the action from Asia to Europe and allows players to fight a near future war in Poland as the Russians and their allies invade and NATO responds.&#10;&#10;Only a portion of Poland is shown as Ukraine is assumed to be in the midst of a grinding civil war. The Russians are not the behemoth of the Cold War, but they possess good material and a much better trained army. The Baltics may fall quickly, although their forces may put up some resistance and make an appearance as reinforcements, and the front quickly establishes itself in eastern Poland as the Russian 6th and 20th Armies push forward while NATO rushes forces into the area spearheaded by the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps and followed up by whatever nation's troops respond to the Article 5 declaration. The question is, can NATO stop the Russians or will Poland be overrun?&#10;&#10;Note: the Next War series is not an Introductory wargame. Rather, we have intended herein to create a system (and a series) that will allow detailed study of modern warfare in various venues as well as engaging gameplay. That said, the Standard Game rules encompass a fairly straightforward ruleset that will, we think, be considered pretty &quot;easy to learn&quot; by experienced wargamers. So players who choose to play Standard Game scenarios can have a relatively quick game when that's what suits them. The real flavor of a war in the theatre, though, comes through in the Advanced Game, where you get much more control over airpower and can more clearly see each side's strengths and weaknesses. For players who want a &quot;mini-monster game&quot; experience, playing the Advanced Game Campaign Scenarios with some or all of the optional rules will definitely &quot;deliver.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

He was the ultimate mounted armored warrior of the ancient world, trained in both shock and missile combat.&#10;&#10;Cataphract portrays the development of the art of war wrought by the early Byzantine Empire, during the reign of Emperor Justinian, under his great Generals, Belisarius and Narses. During this period the Byzantine Empire, also known as the Eastern Roman Empire, for a brief period of time, re-captured a large portion of what was formerly the Western Roman Empire. Although successful in its attempts to reconquer Italy and North Africa, the Byzantine Empire's resources were insufficient to hold on to its gains.&#10;&#10;Cataphract covers all the major battles that defined this Early Medieval era. To place these battles in their proper historical context, the Campaign Game, Justinian, is enclosed, which covers the quest to reconquer the Roman Empire under one ruler.&#10;&#10;Thus, Cataphract contains the decisive battles of the era; a Campaign Game; plus a special bonus Viking raid scenario; and the land/naval leaders for an upcoming series of C3i Magazine Modules covering the Peloponnesian War. The second edition of Cataphract add to the six Early Medieval battles of the first edition, the Ancient Battles of the Utus River (447 CE) and the Catalaunian Fields (451 CE) from the original Attila: Scourge of God Module.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Two spice dealers share a storehouse with a number of hungry rats, who want to put them out of business.  The two dealers want to store spices so that they know where everything is, but they also have to keep the rats at bay.  Stack your crates, keep your spices together, and cover up the rats.&#10;&#10;&#10;Rat Hot is a two-player game developed from Michael Schacht&#039;s Dschunke: Das Legespiel on his own label Spiel aus Timbuktu, which in turn was developed from his game Dschunke, also published by Queen. The Rat Hot tile distribution differs slightly from Dschunke: das Legespiel but you can very nearly use the Dschunke: das Legespiel rules with a Rat Hot set.&#10;&#10;All the games use the clever mechanism of stacking long 3x1 tiles so that the upper tiles obscure some parts of the tiles underneath. In Rat Hot, the two players simply take turns to draw 2 tiles from a face down pile, and add them to the existing layout.&#10;&#10;The tiles are all 1x3 and show a combination of rats, spices or empty crates. Each player has four different types of spice in their player colour which they are trying to form into large groups. Many of the tiles have spices of both colours.&#10;&#10;The game is scored with grey and yellow chips which represent 1 and 2 points. Each time you place a tile, you and your opponent can score points from groups created or changed by that tile. Whenever a group of two of the same spice is formed, the owning player receives one point, or two points for groups of three or more. Beware! If there are three rats of your own colour visible at the end of your turn, you instantly lose.&#10;&#10;When the draw pile is exhausted and the tiles all placed, the board is scored once more for all players, so trying to preserve existing groups also counts.&#10;&#10;The real trick in the game comes in the tile placement. Tiles must be adjacent by at least one square. Tiles can placed on top of other tiles, so that stacks build up. But a tile can not sit exactly on top of another, so there must always be some offset, and all three squares of a tile must be supported by other tiles, or the table.&#10;&#10;Rat Hot can be very tricky. You want to keep your opponent's rats exposed in awkward places, so they have to spend both their moves trying to keep the rats covered. But you also want to set up scoring positions, and cover your own rats, and avoid giving your opponent points as well. There's a good mental challenge here, as you puzzle over the best use and arrangement of your tiles. Do you dare leave two of your rats open, because your opponent may draw more of your rats and make it impossible for you to finish your next turn with less than three showing. Can you get a good group of spices going and also break up your opponent's groups? Tricky problems for tricky minds.&#10;&#10;Rat Hot is a quick, fun game and is a good addition to Queen&#039;s line of small 2-player games. The wood chips make it easy to see who is leading, the tiles are nicely made, the graphics are fun, and the game plays quickly and fairly. You can be stuffed by unlucky tile draws, but perhaps your low score is more to do with your choices, or maybe the other player is just smarter than you. Fast play, easy rules, and the risk of sudden death give Rat Hot a high replay value.&#10;&#10;",

Players both young and old love to hit the bell after spotting a winning combination, so it's no surprise to see the bell return in yet another Shafir design: Speed Cups, a.k.a. Quick Cups.&#10;&#10;In this game, each player receives a set of five plastic cups, each a different color; a deck of 24 cards is shuffled and placed face down in the center of the table next to the bell. One player flips over the top card, which depicts colored objects &ndash; trains, birds, cups, etc. &ndash; stacked vertically or horizontally, then everyone tries to recreate this colored sequence with her own set of cups. The first player to do slams the bell, revels in the soul-brightening &quot;ding&quot;, then (if correct), claims the card. Someone then reveals the next card, and the players start shuffling cups once again.&#10;&#10;Once all the cards have been claimed, whoever holds the most cards wins!&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "In all the spectacle of war there has seldom been a sight the equal of British General Burgoyne's campaign of 1777. The float and march south from Canada had almost a surreal quality juxtaposed against the Adirondack wilderness. Hundreds of vessels making up an immense inland navy on Lake Champlain transported nearly 9,000 combatants together with 138 cannon. Burgoyne's objective was Fort Ticonderoga and from there, Albany, and a rendezvous with British forces coming from New York City. The strategic purpose of the campaign was nothing short of an end to the American Rebellion.&#10;&#10;The intrigue on the American side lay in the cult of personality. Saratoga was to be Benedict Arnold's greatest victory in a string of successes which rank him among the finest field commanders of the era. Known to all Americans as the great traitor, it is ironic to discover that twice he salvaged the Revolution from certain collapse. It was Arnold's conspicuous gallantry and bold leadership which assured America victory at Saratoga and, by extension, its independence.&#10;&#10;The fighting at Freeman's Farm would be savage. Here no farmer's militia, but rather Continental Regulars (anxious to redeem a recent reputation for retreat), stood toe to toe with Europe's finest. The sanguinary nature of the fighting was summed up best by American Brigadier General John Glover who said, &quot;Both sides seemed determined to conquer or die.&quot;&#10;&#10;It's the 19th of September, 1777. Do you, as the British, attempt to storm the prepared American positions on the high ground at Bemis Heights in order to open up the River Road and the most direct route to Albany? Or do you attempt to turn the American left where intelligence reports the American defenses are incomplete and the ground favors your approach? How will you employ the large number of Hessian mercenaries in your army? Will their performance match their reputation?&#10;&#10;As the Americans do you wait on Bemis Heights for the approach of the enemy as General Gates preferred, or do you sortie and meet the approach of the British in the forests where their artillery will be of little value? Will Generals Gates and Arnold cooperate, or will their feud spell disaster for the American cause? And what of the fog on this chilly Autumn morning? Will it be an ally to the Americans by impeding the progress of the enemy?&#10;&#10;These are only a few of the challenges facing you as you relive one of history's most decisive battles and the turning point of the American Revolution.&#10;&#10;",

Each player has a personal game board that represents the valley on which they will play tiles to determine the journey of their tribe through several prehistoric life scenes. Their aim is to gather food points on the plains and in the forests of the valley and to get shelter points for reaching caves in the mountains. A player's turn consists of two steps:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Connect one new tile from the four in his personal pool to the tiles already in play on his board, with connected scenes needing to match. These placements earn food points when a connection is made, earns shelter points when a cave is reached, and sometimes provides a special ability based on the connected scenes.&#10;    Choose a new tile from the five available in a common pool to re-fill his personal pool to four tiles.&#10;&#10;&#10;Sapiens relies on instinctive domino-like mechanisms that are improved by interesting twists:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Laying tiles on personal (modular) game boards brings a bit of a puzzle feel to the game.&#10;     Having two separate scores &mdash; food and shelter &mdash; and knowing that only their lower one matters when determining who wins confronts players with interesting needs and dilemmas.&#10;     Including special powers linked to the eight different scenes represented on the tiles brings a lot of interaction and choices.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Test your mettle in three campaigns spanning World War II, Korea and Vietnam. Battle ashore in the blazing heat of Peleliu in September 1944 to discover the Japanese have changed their strategy and you are forced to dig them out of the coral ridges.  Flares reveal waves of Chinese pouring over the rugged mountains of the Chosin Reservoir, Korea, in sub zero weather in November 1950. Fight house to house in Hue City, Vietnam in February 1968. These three campaigns live on in the legends and history of the United States Marine Corps.&#10;&#10;Fields of Fire is a solitaire game system that gives players the challenge of commanding a rifle company between World War II and Present Day. The game is different from many tactical games in that it is diceless and card based. There are two decks used to play. The Terrain Deck is based on a specific region and is used to build a map for the various missions your company must perform. The Action deck serves many purposes in controlling combat, command and control, various activity attempts. The units of the company are counters representing headquarters elements, squads, weapons teams, forward observers, individual vehicles or helicopters. A single playing is a mission and several missions from an historical campaign are strung together for the player to manage experience and replacements. A mission can be played in about 1 &ndash; 2 hours.&#10;&#10;This volume of Fields of Fire  is based on three actual campaigns experienced by units of the 5th Marines of the 1st Marine Division &quot;Blue Diamond&quot; in World War II, Korea, and Vietnam and is the second volume of the Fields of Fire series.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "1640 A.D. &mdash; a ghastly curse befell a beautiful island in the Indian Ocean. Soon, it was known that its dark magic would not only afflict whoever tried to take away anything from the island, but also haunt whoever even dared approach its coasts, making it the perfect location for pirates to hide their loot.&#10;&#10;1902 A.D. &mdash; centuries later, pieces of ancient treasure maps were found by you and your fellow treasure hunters.&#10;&#10;In Loot Island, players play their map cards to the landings of the island in an attempt to piece together enough of a map to find treasures buried there. At the end of each round, an exploration will take place, and if loot is found in a landing, treasures will be distributed among the players present there on a first come, first serve basis.&#10;&#10;Treasures are distributed only if enough map cards were played in the landing, so usually more than one player needs to contribute cards for loot to be found there. You must then cooperate with your fellow treasure hunters to assemble the maps to find the loot, while at the same time ruthlessly competing with them to get the biggest share of the loot for yourself. It is a pirate treasure after all, arrr!&#10;&#10;Do you have the correct pieces of the map? Do the other players have matching pieces to help you find a route to the treasure? And...will you be able to get rid of the curse?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Warfighter is a card game for 1 to 6 players. You play cooperatively with your friends against the system to complete World War II squad-level combat missions.&#10;&#10;The core game gives you a full team of US Marines and a full set of Japanese Hostiles. Each Expansion then adds to these sets. This includes the soldiers, weapons, equipment, and tactics used by each of those nations. Everything you need to create your own unique squad of soldiers!&#10;&#10;At the start of each mission, you each select one or more Player Soldiers, equip them with skills, weapons, and combat gear within the mission's Resource limit. You then fight your way through hostile territory and engage enemy soldiers, as you attempt to reach and complete your mission objective. Every mission is a stand-alone game. You build your Soldiers, select your Gear, and then run your mission. Within 30 to 60 minutes you will have succeeded or failed.&#10;&#10;Warfighter uses a new combat system that takes into account the fire mode you select for your weapon, range to the target, running out of ammo, suppression fire, and cover - all in the same dice roll! This system creates an incredibly deep narrative with every attack. As you eliminate soldiers, you gain experience to Upgun your Action cards, play Support cards, and activate special Skills.&#10;&#10;The contents of this set includes:&#10;&#10;&#10;     280 cards comprising:&#10;         6 USMC Player Soldiers / 6 Non-Player Soldiers / 5 Squad Soldiers&#10;         9 Missions / 15 Objectives / 18 Locations&#10;         15 Weapons / 6 Gear&#10;         29 Skills&#10;         95 Action / 17 Location Markers&#10;         50 Japanese Hostiles / 9 Events&#10;    &#10;     5 counter sheets with 430 counters&#10;     d6 and d10 dice&#10;     Mounted display board&#10;     9 Campaign sheets&#10;     Warfighter Rulebook&#10;&#10;&#10;The initial print-run from the Kickstarter also included 65 customized Soldier cards as part of KS pledge levels, in addition to 27 errata cards for Warfighter WWII Europe and 16 extra WWII Pacific cards.&#10;&#10;Soldier Types&#10;There are 3 levels of Soldiers in Warfighter: Player Soldiers, Non-Player Soldiers, and Squad Soldiers. If you think about it from a movie point of view...&#10;&#10;Player Soldiers are the stars of the movie. You get to see all their details and really get to know them. They get Health, a hand of Action cards, Skills, detailed Weapon cards. These are the guys you know up-close and personal.&#10;&#10;Non-Player Soldiers have a cost and you purchase them at the start of a Mission as you would a Player Soldier. The NPSs don't hold a hand of Action cards. They have Weapons, Equipment, and Skills, and you use them as normal. They also have a number of Actions per turn based on their current Health. Instead of relying on Action cards for defense, they use the same Cover rules as the Hostiles.&#10;&#10;This makes them much easier to run, and allows you to easily expand your squad.&#10;&#10;Squad Soldiers are the guys standing in the background.&#10;&#10;Their soldier cards include all their game info. They do not use other cards or Action cards. These Soldiers make it very easy to command an entire squad with a single player. They are also a great way to get new players into the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Set in a post-apocalyptic sci-fi setting, Fallen Land: A Post Apocalyptic Board Game is a hybrid game that combines the elements of a strategy board game, with card building and role-playing. It is driven by macabre stories of a world gone mad and features adventure, politics and economics to deliver an unlimited sandbox experience. Each game the variables change: cards, player interactions, stories, strategies and threats. While the game has a strong pulp influence, its roots stem from Cold War studies. We have expanded upon this research to arrive at our game&rsquo;s premise: What would happen after a nuclear and biological apocalypse?&#10;&#10;Our answer is Fallen Land. As a player, you are the leader of a unique faction of survivors competing for primacy in the ruinous aftermath of post-apocalyptic America. You must manage and enhance your town, protect your citizens and secure resources. You will also have to make and break treaties to endure, amidst a myriad of bribery and betrayal by the other players. But that is just where the adventure begins! You must also direct your agents (a party of characters), to explore the rugged landscape, establish your territory and solidify your agenda.&#10;&#10;Game play is comprised of Turns. Each represents one month and is divided into Phases and Sub-Phases. The First Player resolves each Phase and Sub-Phase followed clockwise by the other players, before proceeding to the next Phase or Sub-Phase. A Turn is over when all players have had the opportunity to act or pass on each Phase.&#10;&#10;I. Effects Phase *&#10;    1.) Resolve.&#10;&#10;II. Town Business Phase *&#10;    1.) Deal.&#10;    2.) Resource Production.&#10;    3.) Auction House.&#10;    4.) Roll 1d10 on Town Events Chart.&#10;    5.) Financial period.&#10;        ~Sell.&#10;        ~Purchase.&#10;        ~Hire (NPCMs).&#10;&#10;III. Party Exploits Phase *&#10;    1.) NPCMs move.&#10;    2.) Choose Party Exploits (4 weeks to spend).    &#10;        ~Movement, spend 1 week.&#10;        ~Encounter, spend 1 week.&#10;        ~PVP, spend 1 week.&#10;        ~Resource, spend 2 weeks.&#10;        ~Healing, spend 2 weeks.&#10;        ~Mission, spend 3 weeks.&#10;&#10;IV. End Turn Phase *&#10;    1.) Adjust Turn Marker.&#10;    2.) Pass the First Player Sheet.&#10;&#10;&#10;    Resolve an Action Card in each Phase or Sub-Phase as directed by the card.&#10;&#10;&#10;A player's town is simulated by a Town Play Mat. Players organize their owned Resources, inventory, Party Characters, excess Characters and movement bonuses here. In addition, Town Play Mats can be upgraded three different ways: Town Defense Chips, Town Technologies and Action Cards. The first two upgrades are available for purchase during the Town Business Phase. However, Action Cards are dealt at the beginning of each Turn and are also drawn as a reward.&#10;&#10;    Players also manage their Party consisting of five Character Cards. Characters may be equipped with gear (Spoils Cards), to increase their Base Skills. A party can move around the map, draw Encounter and Mission cards (stories) which contain Skill Checks (challenges) and even attack another player's Party in PVP. Dice are rolled for these many &quot;deeds&quot; to determine the outcome. &#10; There are seven decks of cards. These are drawn and played throughout the game. Some are stories, such as Encounter and Mission Cards, Characters are a Faction's agents, and Spoils are equipment/vehicle/gear. Lastly, Action Cards modify the story and/or game play.&#10;&#10;To win, one of two Victory Conditions is necessary, either 20 Prestige or 80 Town Health. Prestige represents your reputation as a leader, while Town Health represents your town&rsquo;s prosperity and number of its citizens. Both conditions are marked on their respective Victory Tracks bordering the map.&#10;&#10;Adventure and intrigue await!  We hope you have the opportunity to play Fallen Land and that you enjoy playing it as much as we have enjoyed creating it for you.&#10;&#10;",

During the game, the players will generate income by improving their artistic skills and developing relationships with local governments.  Using this money, the players will dispatch their surveyors around the island of Japan in an effort to map its different regions.  After 5 rounds, representing the 21 years it took to complete Tadataka Ino's map, the player who has traveled the farthest and contributed the most to mapping Japan will gain the most honor and will win the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Shadows of Malice is a cooperative game in which 1-8 player(s) work to unseal hidden Wells of Light to prevent the shadow demon Xulth&ucirc;l from gaining a physical form and overrunning the Realm of Aethos.&#10;&#10;The Wells are located in strongholds scattered throughout the Realm and defended by powerful Guardians. Over the centuries, many of the Wells have fallen Dark, but if the players can find and unseal the remaining Light Wells they prevent Xulth&ucirc;l from gaining substance and win the game. If Xulth&ucirc;l&rsquo;s Shadows, however, manage to defile a single Light Well, the demon will gain a body and enter the Realm. If this happens, the players must defeat Xulth&ucirc;l in battle to save the Realm.&#10;&#10;Players control avatars, heroic champions imbued with unique masteries over Light. Each turn, the players move through the Realm, confronting their fate, battling creatures with deadly abilities, and engaging the services of cities and mystics in order to gather the potions, treasure, and soulshards they will need to defeat the stronghold Guardians and unseal the Wells they protect. The Light or Dark nature of each Well is revealed only when its Guardian is defeated.&#10;&#10;Meanwhile, Xulth&ucirc;l&rsquo;s Shadows are thickening in the Shadow Realm and will enter the game at random times in random locations, seeking the one Well that will bring about the entrance of their master.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Weirdwood Manor is a cooperative board game that marries great adventure gameplay with some euro-inspired underpinnings, as you and your group of valiant companions battle to protect Weirdwood Manor and its enigmatic ruler, Lady Weirdwood, from an invading Fae Monster and his Clockwork Scarab minions.&#10;&#10;The Manor is a mysterious and magical place where rooms and the pathways between them can shift as time progresses. The game features a unique temporal mechanic; every time a player or the Fae Monster takes an action, time will move forward in the game and the connections between the rooms will shift via unique rotating corridor rings on the game board. Players have some agency in how to use their actions to affect how quickly (or slowly) time moves, but beware, if the players use up their allotted time and have not defeated the monster, they lose!&#10;&#10;You will assume the role of one of six asymmetrically designed characters as you battle against one of the three different Fae Monsters, each with their own unique mechanics and loss conditions.  You&rsquo;ll make use of dice drafting, card play, resource management, and location actions as you move through the ever-shifting Manor in pursuit of the Fae Monster and his minions. You can also recruit additional companions to aid you and you will improve your character&rsquo;s abilities as you earn experience.&#10;&#10;Each turn, the players will use their own deck of cards to take one primary action. Rooms they move to can offer additional actions and benefits. As well, players can make use of their own unique player and companion powers. These combinations can create varied and potentially powerful chains of actions on a player's turn.&#10;&#10;However, after each player's turn the Fae Monster will act, using their own custom deck of cards. As the game progresses, the Fae Monster&rsquo;s strength will grow and things will become more dire for the players so they will have to work together to solve the challenges in front of them. The game offers deep tactical choice and a degree of unpredictability that will make traditional leader quarterbacking virtually impossible; the players will truly have to strategize as a group to succeed as the threat deepens!&#10;&#10;And so, if the players can defeat the Fae Monster before time runs out - or before the Fae Monster completes his own unique victory condition, the players will win the game and have kept Weirdwood Manor safe for now... until he next threat arrives!&#10;&#10;",

Donation cubes are taken from a career track, which will reveal spaces that change the current reputation of each musician. Each space on the track also represents their remaining life and will die when all cubes are removed.&#10;&#10;Then the player who is currently the major patron to each musician will discard donation cubes to acquire a Composition tile from him.

A successful concert will earn money for the patrons of the performers, which is the main source of income.&#10;&#10;Can you become the most prosperous patron during the age of musicians?

Very few people can withstand the hardships of the lonesome life a shepherd of giant silkworms leads. It is a solitary existence that requires great dedication and strength of character to bear the pressures that stem from competing with the few other shepherds who fight over the scarce but desirable feeding grounds, while keeping the fearsome ookamy at bay.&#10;&#10;Silk is a gateway game into area control and worker placement systems. Players have to move their silkworms to the optimal spaces so they can feed on the best grass available, while pushing the other players' pieces into less desirable feeding grounds. In this game, players roll dice in order to determine which actions they are allowed to perform during their turn. There are six types of actions available: breeding more silkworms, moving the shepherd or their mastiff, building fences or farms, moving the ookami monster around the board, and &mdash; most importantly &mdash; getting your silkworms to feed. When silkworms feed, they generate a number of silk points, depending on the type of terrain they are standing on at that moment. These points can be used to modify the outcome of a dice roll, all while keeping in mind that the player with the most silk points at the end of the game wins!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Celt &mdash; Latin Celta, plural Celtae &mdash; were an early Indo-European people who from the second millennium BCE to the first century BCE spread over much of Europe. Their tribes and groups eventually ranged from the British Isles and Portugal to as far east as Transylvania, the Black Sea coasts, and Galatia in Anatolia, and they were in part absorbed into the Roman Empire as Britons, Gauls, Boii, Galatians, Celtiberians, and Lusitans.&#10;&#10;Celtae is a &quot;worker swapping&quot; game powered by a rondel in which players choose actions to perform during their turn. On their turn, players swap one of their three active workers with one of the three workers on the action space they wish to perform, then they perform the action &mdash; which will be boosted if they have in their worker pool specific types of workers: farmers, builders, soldiers, and nobles.&#10;&#10;&#10;     The farming action allows players to draw cards, and it's boosted by farmers. Cards have three types of uses in the game: building, preparing for battle, and engaging with the druid order.&#10;     The build action allows players to build and expand citadels on the board by placing their discs on them, and it's boosted by builders. At game's end, only completed citadels will score, and players have to work together to complete them and score their presence on them. Each time players build in a citadel, they gain a bonus that was randomly assigned during set-up. The combination of these bonuses with a timely performed action often results in powerful combos.&#10;     The battle action, which is boosted by soldiers, allows players to defeat increasingly stronger Roman armies and to garrison the outskirts of the citadels on the map.&#10;     The recruit action, boosted by nobles, allows players to recruit workers to their tribe, increasing the number of available workers to boost future actions. However, if you manage to send certain types of workers from your tribe into the druid order, you'll get their favor and a druid worker who functions like a joker and boosts almost every type of action.&#10;&#10;&#10;Every player has a leader card assigned to their tribe at the beginning of the game. At a certain point on the game, players will have to choose if their leaders stay on its regular side and like that gain a small number of points at game's end or forfeit those meager points and flip it to its heroic side, which has much harder requirements for much larger endgame points.&#10;&#10;Each time the action marker on the rondel completes a full turn, the player who currently holds the favor of Teutates places a progress marker on one of the progress cards next to the game board. At game's end, only progress cards with progress markers will score, so as the game advances, players determine what will score...and what will not.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Gwent is a standalone card game included inside the Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt videogame by CD Projekt Red. It was available as a physical copy with the Xbox One Collector's Edition of the video game (Northern Realms and Nilfgaardian Empire factions), in &quot;Hearts of Stone&quot;physical expansion for PC/PS4 (Scoia'Tel and Monsters factions) and with the purchase of the Season Pass giving you the opportunity to ask for redeem code to buy both limited editions versions on CD Projekt Red merchandising store.&#10;&#10;Gwent has two players simulating a war between two of four factions: Northern Realms, Scoia'Tael, Monsters, or Nilfgaardian Empire. Players take turns adding strength to the battlefield until both players pass. The highest strength on the battlefield wins the round and matches are played best of three, with little to no card drawing in between rounds. Special cards may also be played to reduce the effect of certain unit types. Gwent also features various once-per-game leader abilities and deck building rules.&#10;&#10;",

Experience the exhilaration of real life auctions!&#10;&#10;In Going, Going, GONE!, players try to win items by bidding on five simultaneous auctions while the Auctioneer counts down from 10 to 1! Players bid on these five simultaneous auctions by physically dropping their wooden cubes (known as &quot;Bucks&quot;) into any or all of the five transparent Auction Cups, each of which represents an auction for one or two Item Cards.&#10;&#10;At the end of the countdown, the Auctioneer says &quot;GONE!&quot; and quickly places the Auction Paddle over the five Auction Cups to close the auctions. The player who has the most Bucks in each Auction Cup wins that auction and takes the Item Cards for that auction. Collections of items may be sold throughout the game for more Bucks, or players can keep building their collections to sell them at the end of the game. The player with the most Bucks at the end of the game wins!&#10;&#10;Going, Going, GONE! is a simple-to-learn, exciting and unique game for players of all skill levels! It is ideal for playing in public spaces. Since the players control the pacing of the game and the variants used, the game adapts to the playing style of the players.&#10;&#10;",

In the late winter of 1943, Soviet Operations code-named Star and Gallop drove the Germans from the city of Kharkov and threatened a complete breakthrough, only to be driven back by the German counteroffensive known as Von Manstein&rsquo;s Back Hand Blow.&#10;&#10;Each volume in the Enemy Action series features:&#10;&#10;     Two-player competition with low complexity and constant decision points for both sides;&#10;     Solitaire play of either side with systems governing all aspects of enemy command and tactics;&#10;     Card-driven impulse system, with multi-purpose cards played to activate formations, implement command events, or gain tactical advantages in combat.&#10;     Diceless and chartless combat system &ndash; players draw combat chits that build a narrative of each combat.&#10;&#10;&#10;The solo games add fog of war to the experience.

She rolls the dice one by one, stopping when she wishes, and the sum of the dice rolled can't exceed 7. If she rolls only one die, she moves forward by the number rolled; if she rolled two dice, she moves twice the sum of her dice (if the sum &le; 7); and if she rolled three dice, she moves three times the sum (again, if the sum &le; 7). If her sum exceeds 7, she removes her piece from the board and starts the lap from the beginning next turn.&#10;&#10;If one piece lands on another, the bottom piece must carry the top one when it next moves; what's more, the owner of the piece on top dictates how many dice the bottom player must roll &mdash; and if those dice sum to more than seven, then both pieces are removed from the track. Stacks can have any number of pieces, and whoever is on top dictates to the active player how many dice she must roll. When a piece in the middle of a stack moves, it leaves all pieces below it in place.&#10;&#10;When a piece or a stack lands on or passes the final space in the lap, the owner of the topmost piece takes one of the prize cards; each prize has a value on it, and once all the prizes have been claimed, whoever has the highest sum of prize cards wins.&#10;&#10;The 2014 edition of the game, Mah&eacute;, allows for play with up to seven player turtles, who are circling the island while trying to lay their eggs on the beach and receive points for doing a good job.&#10;&#10;The 2024 Korean edition of the game, &#234;&#179;&#181;&#235;&#163;&#161; &#235;&#140;&#128;&#236;&#158;&#145;&#236;&#160;&#132;, allows for play with up to seven player &#8;adventurers, who are circling the island while taking back stolen eggs on the T-Rex nest and receive points for taking a lot of eggs.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "&quot;Baltic Gap: Summer 1944&quot;, depicts the Soviet drive into Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania during the summer of 1944. As the game begins, the defense of Vitebsk, a Byelorussian fortified city located just a few hexes beyond the southeast corner of the playing surface, has just collapsed. 1st Baltic Front is advancing westward through the shredded German line, and will soon threaten all of Army Group North with encirclement. Finally, after four months of fierce battle, the Red Army will win the great prize of this campaign, Riga, and pocket the enemy in the Courland region of Latvia.&#10;&#10;Baltic Gap allows players to explore this interesting campaign from a variety of historical and hypothetical vantage points. Long campaign games can be enjoyed by up to five players. Several short scenarios are also provided, and these work best with a single player per side.&#10;&#10;Baltic Gap is the 11th wargame in the award winning Operational Combat System (&ldquo;OCS&rdquo;). It stays true to the ground breaking earlier games in the system that allow players a deeper glimpse into why the skills and behaviors of the two sides were so very different. Here in 1944, we find a much more developed Russian army (much more advanced than the one shown in the 2007 CSR Award winning game Case Blue) facing a still potent German Wehrmacht. The Germans will need to fight their forces with great skill to avoid getting swamped by their tough adversary.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 3 to 4 days&#10;Hex: 5 miles / 8.0 Km&#10;Units: Battalion to Army&#10;&#10;Game Inventory: &#10;Two 22 x 34&quot; Full Color Game Maps &#10;Five countersheets (1,400 1/2&quot; dual-side printed counters)&#10;One 48-page OCS Rulebook &#10;One 48-page Baltic Gap specific Rulebook &#10;Two 4-page OCS Charts and Tables Booklets &#10;2 6-sided dice&#10;&#10;",

Lose, and it's back to the boasting minor league for you. Let's get to the contest!&#10;&#10;Each round, players start with seven cards in hand from a deck that contains cards in three suits &mdash; red, blue, and yellow &mdash; as well as a number of &quot;pass&quot; cards. Randomly stack the three tokens  &mdash; also red, blue, and yellow &mdash; to set up the color rank tower.&#10;&#10;The first player leads a card, and everyone must follow suit, if possible; if they can't, they play a card of their choice. If all cards are the same suit, the highest card wins the trick, and whoever played it leads to the next trick. If cards of multiple colors were played, then whichever color is on top of the color rank tower is trump, and the highest card of this suit wins the trick; if no cards of this color were played, then the highest card of the middle color wins. Move the token that matches the color of the winning card to the bottom of the color rank tower. (A &quot;pass&quot; card is always the lowest card played and cannot win a trick.)&#10;&#10;After seven tricks have been played, score 1 point if you won the &quot;proper&quot; number of tricks: three tricks with three players, two tricks with four, and one trick with five. If you won no tricks, score 2 points! Move your token on the popularity track accordingly.

The stronger wolf wins, strengthening your pack's position &mdash; but despite gaining a scar from the battle and becoming a lone wolf, the weaker one learns from the experience, improving its pack's status for the next encounter. In your struggle, know when to bare your teeth &mdash; and when to go it alone.&#10;&#10;Lone Wolves is a two-player dueling game with trick-taking and area-majority elements that is played over thirteen rounds (tricks). Players start with thirteen cards, and each trick consists of players playing a single wolf card, of which there are five suits each with cards 2&ndash;7 (thirty cards). The cards, however, are played into one of five territories of your choosing, each awarding points to the player who controls it at game's end. The value of the card represents the strength dispatched to that territory. The winning card in a trick remains face up, while the other player's wolf is flipped to its lone wolf side (with a strength of 1). The owner of the losing card gains a scar token to be placed in a territory, and scar tokens have effects such as awarding points for specific cards played into territories, altering strength values, or affecting points awarded in territories.&#10;&#10;Distinguishing itself from most trick-taking games, however, the trump suit in Lone Wolves is dynamic, shifting as the game progresses! Once all scar tokens have been obtained from one territory, the corresponding suit becomes trump; once it happens a second time, the trump suit changes again. The push-and-pull of knowing when to take or lose the trick means that there are no weak hands &mdash; just weak leaders!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "In the late Middle Ages, trade flourished in Europe. Economic groups like the Hanseatic League, the Welser and Fugger families, and merchants from Northern Italy established trading posts and factories in all of the important cities throughout Europe. These businesses provided the population with goods of all kinds, such as fur from the north, cloth from Flanders, wine from the south, and spices from India. The most important commodity of all was salt. In the Middle Ages salt was highly prized it was used to preserve food.&#10;&#10;In Catan Histories: Merchants of Europe, you are a powerful merchant! Start your trading posts in three cities. Recruit new merchants and send them to distant cities to establish trading posts and expand your interests. The more trading posts you have, the more commodities are at your disposal which you can sell profitably in foreign cities. To ensure that your commodities arrive safely at their destination, you must open up trade routes and equip caravans. You win the game if you are the first to deliver all of your commodities to foreign cities.&#10;&#10;Catan Histories: Merchants of Europe is a twist on the 2010 release Settlers of America: Trails to Rails from designer Klaus Teuber and publisher Mayfair Games. Game play is similar in both games: Players start with three locations on the game board, collect resources depending on a die roll, spend resources to move and build, and branch out to new locations with a long-term goal of delivering goods to opponents' cities. The first player to deliver all of his goods wins the game.&#10;&#10;Instead of being played on a fixed game board showing a Catan-ified map of the United States, Die Siedler von Catan: Aufbruch der H&auml;ndler is set on a Catan-ified map of Europe &ndash; which isn't a surprise given that Kosmos is a European publisher. Instead of moving from east to west to mimic the settling of the U.S. by Europeans, players start in the middle of Europe, namely Germany.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "One of the several statistically-based sports simulations produced by the Strat-O-Matic Game Company.  The game consists of player cards and team defensive cards that accurately reproduce play outcomes and player, team, and league statistics of the National Football League for the season on which the cards are based.  Play progresses with the gamer on offense calling his play (run or pass, where the play is directed, the ball carrier or primary receiver, etc.) and the gamer on defense setting a defensive configuration (blitzes, double coverage of receivers, stacking the line, etc.).  In the cards and dice version, three dice are then rolled, with one die determining whether the play result comes from the offensive or defensive cards and the other two determining the result from the speciifed card.  Play takes place on a game board that resembles a football field, and the gamers keep track of the ball position, the down, and the time remaining in the quarter being played.  Penalties and injuries are part of the game.  Gamers play from the perspective of a head coach and/or general manager.&#10;&#10;The game also comes in a computer version that automatically determines play outcomes and compiles and reports player, team and league statistics.  The computer version grapically portrays the plays using X's and O's to depict player movement.  The computer version also features a sophisticated computer coach that faciltates solitaire play.&#10;&#10;Each year the Strat-O-Matic Game Company issues a new set of player and team cards (or computer disk) based upon the most recent NFL season.  The company also issues from time to time sets of players and teams from past seasons.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Each player in Twenty One receives a different score sheet at the start of the game; each sheet has five horizontal rows with six colored dice pictured in each row, and while the numbers are identical in each of the rows on each sheet, the arrangement of colors differs.&#10;&#10;To score points, a player needs to fill these dice with numbers, but they have to fill (or mark off) all six dice in a row before they can move to the next row on their score sheet &mdash; and to write numbers on their sheet, they'll have to depend (at least somewhat) on the luck of the dice.&#10;&#10;On a turn, the active player rolls six colored dice that match the colors depicted on each score sheet. They must keep all 1s that they roll, but they can choose to reroll all non-1 dice twice. After the second roll, all players can use the rolled dice to fill one or more of the dice on their sheet &mdash; but only if the die of the matching color shows a value equal to or less than what's on the score sheet.&#10;&#10;For example, if your row shows a yellow 6, blue 5, white 4, etc., and you or the active player rolls yellow 3, blue 6, white 4, etc., you can choose to write &quot;3&quot; in the yellow space (earning yourself 3 points at the end of the game), but you may choose not to since you could score up to 6 points for that space. You can't write anything in blue since the die is higher than the number shown. You definitely want to write 4 in the white space since 4 is the most points you can score there. What's more, since you had an exact hit, you &quot;x&quot; the box as well, and you score bonus points in a row for the number of &quot;x&quot;s that you have.&#10;&#10;If you can't or don't want to fill in a number, you must cross out the leftmost space in your current row, earning no points for this space. As soon as all spaces in a row are filled or crossed off, you start the next row with the next roll of the dice. The game ends the turn that someone completes the fifth row, after which everyone tallies their points to see who wins.&#10;&#10;",
