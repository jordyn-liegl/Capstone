All the Ninja players are allowed to move any of the shadow tokens, some of which hide the Ninjas of individual players. This means players can accidentally - or not so accidentally - move other players&rsquo; tokens into danger or away from victory. To be a Ninja player you will need a good poker face and an ability to bluff so that no one can guess which shadow hides your Ninja. To be a Guard player you must be prepared to be outnumbered, but not overwhelmed, by all of the shadows that need to be investigated to protect the Shogun&rsquo;s prized koi carp.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Africa Orientale (Italian for East africa), is a simulation of the campaign fought in the horn of Africa in 1940-41.&#10;&#10;On 10 June 1940, Italy declared war on Britain and France, which made Italian military forces in Libya a threat to Egypt and those in the Italian East Africa a danger to the British and French territories in the Horn of Africa. Italian belligerence also closed the Mediterranean to Allied merchant ships and endangered British supply routes along the coast of East Africa, the Gulf of Aden, Red Sea and the Suez Canal. Egypt, the Suez Canal, French Somaliland and British Somaliland were also vulnerable to invasion, but the Comando Supremo (Italian General Staff) had planned for a war after 1942.&#10;&#10;Hostilities began on 13 June 1940, with an Italian air raid on the base of 1 Squadron Southern Rhodesian Air Force (237 (Rhodesia) Squadron RAF) at Wajir in the East Africa Protectorate (Kenya). In August 1940, the protectorate of British Somaliland was occupied by Italian forces and absorbed into Italian East Africa. This occupation lasted around six months. By early 1941, Italian forces had been largely pushed back from Kenya and Sudan. On 6 April 1941, Addis Ababa was occupied by the 11th (African) Division, which received the surrender of the city. The remnants of the Italian forces in the AOI surrendered after the Battle of Gondar in November 1941, except for groups that fought an Italian guerrilla war in Ethiopia against the British until the Armistice of Cassibile (3 September 1943) ended hostilities between Italy and the Allies.&#10;&#10;The rules use the basic The Europa Series system as a framework, with specialized rules covering the historical situation in detail.&#10;&#10;Originally published by 3W (World Wide Wargames) in Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #128&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Turn: half a month&#10;Hex: 32 miles / 51 kilometers&#10;Units: Battalion to Division&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 22 x 34&quot; 5 color mapsheet&#10;One dual-side printed countersheet (200 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 24-page Africa Orientale rules booklet&#10;&#10;Complexity: Medium&#10;Solitaire Suitability: Medium&#10;Players: 1 or more&#10;Playing Time: 4-6 Hours&#10;&#10;Players will need to provide one 6-sided die&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "(from the back of the box:)&#10;&#10;Blitzkrieg in the South is the first in the East Front Battles series, a series which will cover the whole of the Russo-German front in World War II.&#10;&#10;Ground Scale is 5 miles to the hex, turns represent 2 days of real time, units represent division, brigades, regiments, or battalions.  The game covers the Axis assault on the south-west Soviet Union, which began with the attack by Army Group South with 41 divisions (plus allied divisions) against a Soviet force of 60 divisions.  The game concludes in mid-August 1941, at which time, historically, 20 Soviet divions surrendered in the &quot;Uman Encirclement.&quot;&#10;&#10;The game contains a wealth of different unit types - including bridging units, motorcycle infantry, an armored train, a Soviet river flotilla, combat engineers, rocket artillery, anti-aricraft units, et., etc. - as well as the more standard armored, mechanized, and infantry units.  Supply, weather, and terrain all play their part, as do fortifications, strongpoints (these can be built each turn), air power, artillery, reinforcements and replacements, headquarters units, and reserves.  The game sequence includes &quot;reaction movement&quot; by units in reserve status, as well as separate motorized movement phases.  A particularly eleqant piece of design has the Axis motorized movement following standard movement and combat - thus facilitating armored breakthrough; for the Soviets the order is reversed, leading to poorer coordination between tanks and infantry...&#10;&#10;There are 4 scenarios - The Siege of Kiev is an introductory scenario lasting 7 turns, and using only Map B.  Rundstedt Attacks depicts the German assault on perhaps the strongest portion of the Soviet frontier; it last 5 turns and uses only Map A.  Secenario 3, &quot;Optional Deployment,&quot; is a variant of #2.  The Campaign Game lasts 27 turns and uses all 3 maps.  Victory is judged both in terms of combat losses, and the Axis capture of key geographical objectives.&#10;&#10;Historically accurate, fast paced, and playable - Blitzkrieg in the South is a worthy first entry in what will surely become the definitive East Front Series.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 2 days&#10;Hex: 5 miles / 8 Km&#10;Units: Battalion to Division&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;Three 22 x 34&quot; maps&#10;Two dual-side printed countersheets (400 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 20-page rules booklet&#10;One 1-page Turn Record Track&#10;Four 1-page scenario set-up cards (two Soviet &amp; 2 Axis)&#10;&#10;",

Each player secretly chooses an answer to this question with their response cards. If everyone guesses correctly, flip over the top card to add another animal to the pile, then read the newly revealed question and guess again. If no one guesses correctly, set aside this top card and use a new question.

The &quot;Chief&quot; player (a &quot;job&quot; that rotates each round) determines whether the lighter or the heavier side of the scale will be declared the winning side at the end of this round.&#10;&#10;During a round, each player places one of their stones onto one of four spaces at the ends of the see-saw. The order of the players is determined by the Chief. Before placing a stone, each player may raise the prize to be won (the currency in this game are wooden discs - &quot;wheels&quot;) in the middle of the game or take one disc. Taking a disc automatically excludes you from winning any discs at the end of the round. Special abilities of the different kinds of stones and the fact that all players play each type of stone over several matches makes this a rather heavy tactical wagering game.&#10;&#10;English rules for 2-4 players will soon be available on the Chili Spiele website as well as here on BGG.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Seven Years War is a simulation of the war between Prussia and a Coalition of European states, 1756-1764, published in Strategy &amp; Tactics #163 (Sep 1993). While militarily a stalemate, the war consolidated Prussia's dominance of central Europe until its defeat at Jena and Auerstadt in 1806.&#10;&#10;The game is designed for two players or two teams. The Prussian Allied side, opposes the Coalition side. The objective is to gain control of as many central european fortress cities as possible without losing control of your own. The rules consist of a Standard Game that gives a relatively simple but historically valid game, and an Advanced Game providing a more complete historical simulation. Play centers around the operational activity of moving armies, fighting battles and besieging fortresses. However, this operational activity is heavily influenced by, and is intertwined with, the ever changing strategic choices and actions the players take as the game proceeds. This game is falling through the cracks in recent years. There is a reasonably good Cyberboard gamebox but it would be nice if someone would create a Vassal module as well.&#10;&#10;Operational aspects include leaders, a variable movement table, discipline classes for units, logistics with supply wagons and foraging, and limited intelligence. Forces are comprised of infantry, cavalry, light troops, pioneers and artillery. Combat is modified by battleplan chits, selected before the die is rolled, that allow a player to emphasize line infantry, or more elite units, or cavalry achieving strength bonuses or die roll modifiers. The combat table produces percentage loss and moral checks for one or both sides. One learns that strength is not always the deciding factor. Leadership, high discipline, moral and making use of unit specialization play a big roll. Fortresses can also be captured by siege combat.&#10;&#10;Strategically, the game makes use of random events, diplomacy, (the various European states get pushed in and out of neutrality and switch sides). Winning battles can give a player diplomatic options. As the game proceeds the progress of both sides is recorded on the Balance of Power track which can also modify victory. It is possible for both sides to achieve a victory. The two are then compared to give a final victory. Also, both sides can lose if the Balance of Power track moves too far toward one of the players. Restraint is part of a player's strategic considerations.&#10;&#10;The game is complete by magazine game standards. The errata is light. It is not a simple game and it requires players to be willing to roleplay the point of view of the leaders from that period. There is a four turn short scenario covering the first year of the conflict. A full campaign game can last as long as 28 turns if things are drawn out. It is a highly replayable game.&#10;&#10;Errata and Q&amp;A for 7YW were published in Strategy &amp; Tactics #s 165, 166, 167, and 169.&#10;Additional counters for 7YW were included in Strategy &amp; Tactics #s 170 and 171. &#10;7YW also received extensive coverage in Moves #79.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "300: The Board Game is a fast and exciting way for 2-4 players to recreate the Battle of Thermopylae as depicted in Frank Miller's epic film. In the 2 player version, one player controls the Spartans and the other player controls the Persians. In the 3 player game, 2 players compete for the most Glory as the Spartans, and in a 4 player game, 2 players also compete as the Persians for the most Spartan kills.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, the battle forces (represented by round cardboard Units) are already lined up and ready to fight at the border of the Hot Gates. Each time a Persian Unit dies, the Spartans score Glory Points on the Glory Track that surrounds the board. Spartan Units die permanently, while most defeated Persian Units can enter the game again as reinforcements.&#10;&#10;The Object of the Game for the Spartans is to score 100 Glory (or 50 Glory if there are 2 Spartan players). The Object of the Game for the Persians is to wipe out the Spartans before they can achieve their Glory, or to delay the Spartans long enough for Ephialtes to reach the end of the Goat Path (6 rounds of play). If there are 2 Persian Players, then the player with the most Spartan kills wins this game.&#10;&#10;The game uses cards and dice to simulate the action from the film. Spartan Heroes include Leonidas, Stelios, the Captain, Dilios, and Astinos. Persian Leaders include Xerxes, the Uber Immortal, and the Persian Generals. Each card simulates the action associated with a quote from the film, such as &quot;I Would Gladly Kill My Own Men For Victory&quot; (Persian) and &quot;Tonight We Dine In Hell!&quot; (Spartan).&#10;&#10;The game plays quickly (20 - 30 minutes), and is meant to be a fast diversion with a good share of both tactics and luck.&#10;&#10;Official 2-Player Variants&#10;https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/671632/2-player-variants&#10;&#10;",

While the Germans lurked in their woodland labyrinths, and the Sarmatian horsemen fled along the infinite plains of the East, the Dacians, hunkered down in the Carpathian mountains, represented the only sedentary barbarian people in Europe who still resisted the Roman invader.&#10;    This enemy offered an ideal target because they could not flee unlike the other semi-nomadic peoples.&#10;&#10;Player's description:&#10;The game has a unit scale of 1 Strength Point = 1000 to 2000 men, or 500 to 1000 horsemen.

The gameplay remains mostly the same as you play the role of a great God or a team of Gods, defending your reign from rival Gods by using the warriors and disciples loyal to you. In this version of the game, each player chooses to be a member of the pantheon of Old Gods from H.P. Lovecraft's mythos, such as Cthulhu or Hastur.&#10;&#10;When playing with 2 to 6 players, you win by reducing all of the other Gods to 0 energy or by reaching 25 energy. When in a Team Match, you play with 4 or 6 players teamed up in pairs of two. You will have one Main God and a Support God. A team wins together if they can eliminate the opposing team's Main God.&#10;&#10;Rise of the Old Ones introduces a new game mechanism to this world known as Artifacts.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Railroads was designed to be a game about table talk.  It's about making deals with other players, riding the rise and fall of various authentic nineteenth century railroad companies.  In most railroad board games, one player is one company, and is engaged in pure competition with the other players.  That doesn't make for a very social experience.  Since players are investors in Railroads, they have the opportunity to benefit from semi-cooperative ventures, while hedging out their allies with other investments.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Railroads is not a game about budgets and check books.  Money functions as points and are never spent.  Stock tokens are played and moved in a simplified fashion that means strategy is emphasized and budgeting is eliminated.  Stocks are merely methods of earning money (scoring points) so players can focus on their larger plans.&#10;&#10;Players who play alone in Railroads will not do very well.  Railroads only gain as much track per turn as there are players in the company.  If there is only one player in the company, they only lay one track per turn and will not make a lot of money.  However, if you can get one or two people to join your venture, you can double or triple the speed that your railroads grow, turning your fledgling railroad into a geopolitical force to be reckoned with. Just make sure that when the money dries up, you are the first one out.&#10;&#10;A small number of handmade wooden versions were sold and are available on the second hand market.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Originally published by Games Workshop in White Dwarf 161 and now available to download on GW's Spanish site, Warmaster (no relation to the 2000 miniatures game) is a two-player board game that recreates the Emperor's attack on Horus's battle barge at the end of the Battle for Earth.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game the Imperial player has no idea where Warmaster Horus is located and must search the ship to find him as quickly as possible.  Hidden perils confront the Imperial player, who will face traps and ambushes, as they search for the Warmaster.  As the game progresses, the Emperor's dwindling forces will face greater numbers of Traitors as they, the traitors, receive reinforcements.  The Emperor is in a race against time to defeat Horus or die trying.&#10;&#10;The Traitor player wins by killing the Emperor and the Imperial player wins by killing Horus, if both are killed at the same time, the game is a draw.&#10;&#10;",

They proceeded to award themselves fat contracts, paid for by the U.S. Congress, to construct their own railway.&#10;&#10;In Credit Mobilier, four fictional railways race to construct track and move goods westward while the players invest in the railways and the Credit Mobilier.&#10;&#10;User review: There are five railroads; each of a different color. Four of the railroads have fifteen shares of stock, a treasury card, ten railroad tracks, and several blocks. The fifth railroad, Credit Mobilier, only has the stock and treasury card. The game board represents the United States. One block is put on each of the cities randomly. Each player begins the game with three dollars and a share of Credit Mobilier stock. A start player is randomly chosen and the game begins.&#10;&#10;In turn, each player will roll the five dice. The player will then choose to lay track (which adds to the Credit Mobilier treasury), move freight (which may add to the treasury of the railroad that owns the freight and traversed upon track), buy stock of one railroad (if available) for one dollar each, or pay dividends to the owners of the shares of one company.&#10;&#10;A player&rsquo;s options are limited to which colors are rolled on the dice. Rolling orange is the only color that lets one pay dividends. Purple represents Credit Mobilier and it is also &lsquo;wild&rsquo; but it can only be used as a duplicate of any color rolled except orange.  &#10;Players take turns in clockwise order until there are blocks of two colors which have yet to be transported to the Pacific Coast wherein the game ends immediately. The player with the most cash on hand is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

Two opposing heroes &mdash; Hector of the Trojans and Achilles of the Greeks &mdash; seek the favor of the gods to lend them support and tip the scales of fate. Only one side will emerge victorious, its hero becoming the legend of the Iliad.&#10;&#10;Iliad is a tile-placement strategy game for two-players by Reiner Knizia. On your turn, select one of two tiles from your hand and place it onto the board adjacent to an opponent's tile. Both players have symmetrical pools of tiles, with their strength ranging from 1-5, along with the Dolos tile that mimics your opponent's adjacent tiles. The key to victory lies behind the relentless tension of where and when to commit your tiles. When placing a tile, you may also activate the tile's ability, which can serve to turn the tide of war.&#10;&#10;When a row or column is filled, the player with the highest total strength in that line earns the right to select one of the two success tokens at the ends of that row or column; the other token goes to their opponent. Success tokens can earn you the favor of the Gods, and they can earn (or cost you) points. At the end of the game, the winner is the player who has earned the favor of all five Gods. If both players &mdash; or neither of them &mdash; meet this qualification, then the player who has earned the most points wins. Thus, players will face tough tactical trade-offs as they must decide whether to compete for exclusive favor of the Gods or for the most points &mdash; then influence the outcome of the game toward their intended advantage.&#10;&#10;Iliad is the first game in the Mythos Collection, a line of two-player titles by Bitewing Games featuring strategy and mythology.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Pick up precious artifacts while you sail up and down the Nile river, offer them to the monuments currently being built, and the Gods shall bless your travel!&#10;&#10;Each turn in Nile Artifacts, you move your ship forward, stopping at one of the nine ports and picking up one of the artifact cards available there. You may also pick up gold, which can be used to obtain more artifacts or to turn your ship around and sail the Nile in the opposite direction. Once every ship has arrived at one end of the Nile, players can make their offerings to the monuments currently in construction, each of them requiring a different type or combination of artifacts. Whenever a monument is completed, players receive victory points depending on the amount of donations they have made towards this particular monument.&#10;&#10;When offerings are done, the ships go back on the Nile to travel in the other direction and pick up more artifacts. Once the monument deck is empty, the player with the most victory points wins!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "1830 Cardgame is an economic slugfest by the designer of railroad games like Lokomotive Werks and Union vs. Central, and your goal is to have the most money on hand at game's end. Each turn you draw a card from one of three face-up cards, then perform one of four actions:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Buy a share, paying the cost.&#10;    Buy a train, which (strangely) costs nothing.&#10;    Build a station.&#10;    Pay dividends.&#10;&#10;&#10;Each share is worth the number of stations a company has that have trains to service them. As in 1830: Railways &amp; Robber Barons, an inspiration for this design, trains must be purchased in order; players are limited in the number of trains they can own. The game ends after all shares have been purchased, all &quot;8&quot; trains have been acquired, or twelve dividend payouts have been made.&#10;&#10;Released as part of the 2012 Essen package from Winsome.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Selection #4 of The Games Collection by Pin International.&#10;&#10;Creeper is an abstract strategy game which belongs in the same family as Hex/Twixt. That is, two players attempt to link two sides of the board with a chain of pieces.&#10;&#10;Players: 2 only. One plays black, the other white.&#10;The Bits:&#10;&#10;     16 pawns, 8 black and 8 white.&#10;     32 &quot;Othello&quot; disks, i.e. black one side and white on the other.&#10;     A board made up of a 6&times;6 square grid of octagons. &#10;&#10;&#10;The game: Although the spaces on the board are octagonal, the main playing pieces ( the pawns ) are placed and played in the squares that are formed where the corners of the octagons meet.&#10;On his/her turn, the player may move one of their 8 pawns.&#10;A move may consist of leaping diagonally over an octagon, or a simple move between one octagon and the next in a straight line, or finally a pawn may capture an opponents` pawn by jumping over it a la checkers/draughts.&#10;&#10;In the first case, if a pawn makes the diagonal jump one of two actions may take place: if the octagon is empty, one of the disks is played inside it, with the players` colour uppermost. Alternatively, if the octagon is occupied by an opponents` disk, this disk is flipped over to show the opposite side (and therefore colour). &#10;The winner is the first player to link two specific diagonally opposed corners ( black must link top left to bottom right and white top right to bottom left), with a continuous chain of their colour disks. Only orthogonal links count, not diagonal.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The game comes with multilingual rules (english, spanish, italian, german and french) and instructions to build 10 different F1 circuits.&#10;Each player must set the gear and roll an appropriate number of special dice, that determine the speed of the car and the fuel consuption. The game is turn based and the phasing player, after moving his car, must set the gear for next turn. The box strategy is the most important decision to take. You can decide to complete all the 3 laps without stopping or making one or two pitstops.&#10;The game is not a &quot;simulation&quot;, but to win you need a good amount of skill. Even if the speed of your car is determined by dice, you have to choose carefully the &quot;braking point&quot; in order to enter the curves at the best speed. If you exceed the curve's speed limit, you lose &quot;tyres points&quot;. Of course, you can simulate a championship playing different circuits. What's interesting is that the game strategy changes from circuit to circuit and if you design your own circuit you need all your &quot;driving skill&quot; to be competitive. Rookies can win, but they will find very hard to beat a skilled player.&#10;Game components: 65 tiles to build the circuits (an avarege of 25 tiles are needed for each circuit), 6 plastic sport cars, 12 special dice, 6 &quot;dashboards&quot;, 40 speed limit tokens, 24 plastic pawns, one rules booklet.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "&ldquo;Royal Defense&rdquo; is an easy fantasy-themed strategy game. You are supposed to assume the role of the militant feudal and to put a halt to the hostile lords&rsquo; encroachments on the throne of the fairy kingdom. Mercenaries will help you: they are ready to spill their blood on the battlefield for a pretty penny and promises of glory.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;Royal Defense&rdquo; vaguely resembles &ldquo;Battles of magicians&rdquo; and &ldquo;Memoir&rsquo;44&rdquo;. Lords&rsquo; castles are located on both sides of the game-board. Players can recruit troops and build fortifications there. The battlefield itself is two-sided and it contains special structures, giving bonuses to players who occupy these locations.&#10;&#10;Before starting the game, each player chooses one of the four mercenary factions, which will be his army. Characters of each faction are represented by the cards. They have their own  particularities, strengths and weaknesses. A lot of soldiers have not only ordinary characteristics such as velocity, attack and defence, but also some special abilities (which are very often unique for the army) that can be used during the game.&#10;&#10;The confrontation between barons is very swift. Having recruited troops from hand, a player can move forward and attack. As soldiers can move only forward, so five &ldquo;corridors&rdquo; appear on the battlefield where the major battles occur. But each player can activate only five units during his or her turn, and some characters can change the lines they move along. All these points transform simple mechanics into an interesting tactical puzzle. The more the player is experienced, the more difficult is to solve this puzzle. Moreover, spells, able to change course of action, are available for each player. Soldiers also can be sent to the Catacombs in the hope of finding treasures hidden there.&#10;&#10;There are two ways to win: to help your mercenaries to end up beyond the edge of your adversary&rsquo;s field or to get 20 points for having struck adversary&rsquo;s troops and having destroyed his structures.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;Royal Defense&rdquo; is a duel strategy game with low learning curve. Its rules are easy to explain and the game will not take long. Besides, rules also propose different options for three and four players.&#10;&#10;",

In addition to the glorious Bolt Action rulebook and eight Orders Dice, you will find forty hard plastic, multi-pose 28mm miniatures as well as terrain for them to fight over. This is a great starting point as you seek to defeat your foes and bring an end to the greatest conflict in history.&#10;&#10;This introductory boxed set includes miniatures from two factions &ndash; German and Americans &ndash; allowing two players to learn the basic rules of the game. Using miniature soldiers, tanks and terrain, you can fight battles in the shattered towns of occupied France, either liberating or holding the position according your faction. By moving miniatures that represent troops and vehicles (like Sherman tanks or half trucks) along a scenery-filled tabletop and using dice to resolve shooting or attacking actions as well as leadership tests, you attempt to finish the enemy army or achieve certain objectives.&#10;&#10;",

The player fights each enemy in sequence, matching their own dice versus the enemy's. Whoever wins each dice match causes damage to the opponent.&#10;&#10;Gladiator Gauntlet utilizes a unique mechanic which dynamically ties your health to your combat rolls. With your health represented by two dice, you can choose to lower your guard to deliver a heavy blow and replace a low-value combat die with a high-value health die, or you can play defensively and replace a high-value combat die with a low-value health die.&#10;&#10;Be careful, though, because if any of your health die reach 0, you lose that die permanently, reducing your options later on. Earn glory to modify rolls and carefully manage your health and combat to defeat all rounds and win the games.&#10;&#10;&#10;This game received the following awards in The 2017 9-card Nanogame PnP Design Contest:&#10;&#10;1st Place: Best New Designer&#10;3rd Place: Best Artwork&#10;7th Place: Best Overall Game&#10;&#10;",

This challenging game develops strategic thinking skills, and by solving strategy problems, helps children to develop solutions to real-life problems.&quot;&#10;&#10;The board is made up of nine or seven horizontal rows (&quot;sliders&quot;) containing various combinations of holes and barriers. The players start with five pegs each, on opposite ends of the board, and attempt to be the first to get all of their pegs to the other side. On a turn, the player can either move a peg orthogonally as far as they want without crossing a boundary, or they can move one of the rows left or right, shifting the location of the holes and barriers in an attempt to block their opponent's moves or open a path for their own pegs.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Human Interface: Nakamura Tower (HINT) is a board game that is a unique combination of many elements known from tactical and skirmish games, RPGs and board games. The game is based on a struggle between two powerful megacorporations that takes place in the title tower.&#10;&#10;HINT is designed for 2+ people but through different scenarios can be played alone, in cooperation or against other players. The story happens in the near future when the world is dominated by new technologies.&#10;&#10;In HINT you will lead a team of selected professionals of a given faction. Each of them has unique skills and abilities, each one can be given weapons and other equipment, be enhanced genetically or cybernetically. All characteristics and modifiers are presented on special character and equipment cards (you don&rsquo;t need to constantly flick through the rulebook). Each character card has a limited amount of slots that can be filled with equipment and modifications. The player can purchase additional equipment to replace the current item depending on the &ldquo;group&rsquo;s assets&rdquo;. You may like your heroes or hate them but they will no longer be just anonymous pawns.&#10;&#10;The game is played on a board showing the interior of the Nakamura corporate tower that is under attack by its rivals. The characters are moved using spaces on the board. This eliminates the need to measure distance when moving and fighting thus quickening the pace of the game and allowing to avoid misunderstandings. Each space presents a specific tactical situation that influences the characters placed on it.&#10;&#10;Game mechanics are fairly easy as we wanted to achieve a perfect balance between a fun game and rules that enable a lot of tactical possibilities. The basic rules are easy to learn but the possibilities of their use grow significantly in combination with the characters&rsquo; skills and capabilities of equipment. The characters are defined by their basic physical and mental abilities and modifiers, which make it easier or more difficult to perform some tasks, that make them unique. These modifiers result from their skills, special training or cyberations and other equipment. The rules do not use any dice and the testing mechanics are based on cards that we call CanDo. The description on the card, its value and colour influence the final result of the test. The numerical value also states the location of a hit and additional effects connected to it.&#10;&#10;",

Oh, and they'll need to search quickly, too, or else the giants will wake from the sleeping spell cast on them and run the searchers out of the forest. Who can combine speed, control and a good memory to find the imps where they hide?&#10;&#10;To set up, players place the 16 imp tokens in the holes on the game board, cover these imps with the 85 cardboard leaves included in the game, then place one large wooden giant on each corner of the board. On a turn, the active player reveals a search card showing one of the imps. An opponent flips the sand timer, then the player uses her magic wand to push the leaves aside and (fingers crossed!) find the imp on the search card. She can use her wand to move the giants as well, but if they fall off the game board &ndash; or even so much as a single leaf falls &ndash; the giants awaken and chase the player away empty-handed. If the player reveals the target imp, though, she keeps the search card to record her find. After each search, players cover the board again and return the giants to their places. In the end, whoever has collected the most search cards wins!&#10;&#10;Die verzauberten Rumpelriesen includes rules for cooperative play, with the players using their wands together to search for the imps one by one as they're revealed by the search cards. If the players find more than eight imps without the giants awakening, they win.&#10;&#10;",
