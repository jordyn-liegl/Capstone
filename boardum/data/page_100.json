Small war parties often acted according to their own will rather than following orders from &ldquo;commanding officers.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;The game includes two decks of opportunity cards.  Each player starts the game with one card and, while the Indian player can &ldquo;earn&rdquo; one more by actions taken in the game, the American player may use momentum to &ldquo;purchase&rdquo; additional cards throughout the game.&#10;&#10;Pre-game Indian Enhancement and limited American intelligence help provide play balance to an outnumbered Indian army.  Optional Indian reinforcements are also available.&#10;&#10;Newtown also includes rules for Indian honor, resolve under artillery fire, ferocity and evasion.&#10;&#10;In Oriskany, the Indian player&rsquo;s secret pre-game selection of the ambush hex and the American player&rsquo;s turn-by-turn choice for Herkimer&rsquo;s rate of march will have profound effect on the course of play.  Proximity to Ft. Stanwix is not the only thing that must be taken into account.  If the column is ambushed while moving at an accelerated rate the ambushing Indians receive advantages.  On the other hand, if Herkimer approaches cautiously he can better defend against an ambush but risks losing army morale for progressing too slowly with the rescue effort.&#10;&#10;Herkimer&rsquo;s Tryon County Militia is made up of special 2-step, 1-strength point units permitting each unit to take a step loss and continue to fight.  This expedient is used to reflect the intensity of the fighting that occurred between the two forces.  Militia at Oriskany fought like veteran line units, giving and asking no quarter, for nearly six straight hours.&#10;&#10;Oriskany also includes pre and post-ambush Sequences of Play and rules for laagering and limbering the American supply wagons, looting, detaching American garrison artillery and the possibility of storms.&#10;&#10;2 errata counters are included in C3i #27 (2013)&#10;&#10;",

These creatures come from the underwater Ker-Ys city.&#10;&#10;PREPARATION&#10;&#10;&#10;     In turn, the players place all elements of the game area (wall ruins, swamps).&#10;     Four creatures are introduced in the game and will progress from the door (in the centre of a glade) towards either side of the game board (representing the druids&rsquo; path surrounding the glade). Creatures&rsquo; moves are pre-defined and happen automatically.&#10;     The players place their team of three druids whose role is to prevent the creatures from invading the human world.&#10;     Energy markers are set at the start level and the knowledge track markers are set under the tracks.&#10;     The pile of Power cards is shuffled and placed near the board.&#10;&#10;&#10;THE GAME&#10;&#10;The game consists of a defined number of rounds (depending on number of players). Every round is composed of the following phases:&#10;&#10;&#10;     The creatures progress. The creatures already on the board progress towards the side of the board using a totally automatic way of moving. New creatures (1 to 3, depending on a dice roll) arrive on the board and start to progress too.&#10;     Preparation of the Action tiles. The six Action tiles are shuffled and placed one by one forming a line, face up. These tiles represent all possible actions, each tile being separated into a major and a minor action. The number of places available on the tiles depends on the number of players.&#10;     Choice of actions. Each druid team carries out 5 actions a round, represented by Action markers. Players, in the reverse order of their position on the score track, choose their actions one by one by setting their Action markers on the available places on the Action cards. Actions can be: moving the druids (they only move on the path surrounding the glade), setting a magical stone (a magical stone is set at the intersection of the magical beams emitted by two druids looking at the glade, this costs energy; the magical beams do not cross obstacles), capturing creature(s) (a druid may capture a creature in front of him with his magical beam; this costs energy but gives MP and sometimes special properties), progressing in knowledge tracks (to increase the capacity of moving, or to increase the influence at the druid council, for &shy;instance), preparing magical beverages (to increase knowledge but also to recover energy), moving a magical stone (it is possible to move a magical stone), acquiring Power cards (they give special powers, such as allowing the magical beam to pass through a wall), and influencing a creature (allows to move a creature).&#10;     Actions are performed. Actions are performed marker by marker, from left to right, starting with the major actions before doing the minor ones. If the same colour of marker is encountered a second time on the same action, this action is not carried out. The actions on the next Action tile are then carried out and so on, until all major or all minor actions have been performed. Then, the players come back to the stopped action to perform it. Druids must inform the council about all their actions. After they have set a stone, captured a creature, or prepared a magical beverage, druids are placed at the druid council. Any druid can start from the council to enter back the path, but he can also stay at the council to influence it and gain MP at the end of the round.&#10;     Activation of magical stones. At the end of each round, all stones that are aligned and of the same colour automatically become menhirs. MP are attributed to the corresponding players and depend on the distance between the stones that have been transformed, as well as their position in the glade. Menhirs have a special property that will be activated at the end of the game.&#10;     Druid council. At the end of each round, the influence of each druid team on the council is evaluated. Players receive as many MP as their number of druids at the council. In addition, the team in majority can increase his knowledge in one of the knowledge tracks.&#10;&#10;&#10;Then, a new round can start.&#10;&#10;END OF THE GAME&#10;&#10;The game is finished after 5 or 6 rounds, depending on the number of players. In addition to the MP gained during the game, players receive MP according to the magical stones still on the board and the Power cards still in their&nbsp;hands. &#10;Also, the final menhir layout is important and can afford MP according to two different scenarios. If the central door (from which the creatures come) can be completely shut in by drawing a connecting line between menhirs, then MP are attributed to the players for the menhirs they have placed in the glade. If it is not possible to shut in the central door by connecting menhirs, then MP are attributed to the players for the creatures that they have captured.&#10;&#10;THE WINNER&#10;&#10;The winner is the player with the highest MP score.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "From the publisher:&#10;&#10;Between January and May 1944, Allied forces launched four major attacks on German positions at the abbey of Monte Cassino.  Three times the Germans drove them back, until finally on 18 May 1944 a troop of Polish Lancers raised their red-and-white pennant over the ruins. Over 50,000 Allied soldiers and more than 20,000 Germans fell in the struggle for Monte Cassino.&#10;&#10;Cassino '44 is a complete boxed game in the Panzer Grenadier series by David Murray, covering all four of the battles. From the initial American assaults through the final Polish conquest, every stage of the battle is depicted in scenario form with two lengthy campaign games covering the entire affair.&#10;&#10;Forces involved include the tough American 36th &quot;Texas&quot; Division, the 4th and 8th Indian Divisions including Gurkha battalions, the 2nd New Zealand Division with its brigade of Sherman tanks and elite Maori Battalion, and the hard-fighting exiles of the Polish II Corps.  On the German side, the 1st Parachute Division was probably the best formation the Axis put into the field in World War II, and it's assisted by the 15th Panzer Grenadier Division and other formations.&#10;&#10;This game is part of the Panzer Grenadier series&#10;&#10;",

The game includes three double-sided boards, which can be used to create 12 different tracks, eight teams consisting of 2 Formula One cars each, and eight sets of three dice matching the colors of each of the teams.  Movement is controlled by the dice, with the number of dice rolled being dependant on the car's position on the track.  The game boards are beautifully rendered, and the cars are simply the best available in any racing game on the market.&#10;&#10;http://www.aza-spiele.de/frameset.php3?sprache=e&amp;start=spiele&amp;ebene2=motorchamp&amp;mark=motorchamp&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "In this light, humorous, and fast-paced card game that parodies geek culture and co-habitation, players are roommates just trying to get through life with as little work as possible.&#10;&#10;At setup each player is dealt a Job card which lists their free time, income, a special ability that they possess and their Slack goal. Players are also dealt five Life cards. The space directly in front of a player is their Room, where cards will be played during the course of the game. Slack can be represented using any available chit or counter, but every player begins with a Slack total of zero.&#10;&#10;Players take turns as follows:&#10;-Draw Life cards until they have six in hand. (NOTE: Some Jobs vary this to five or seven cards.)&#10;&#10;-Make &quot;variable&quot; rolls. Some Job cards have variable free time or income; their values for this turn are decided in this phase (rolling a 1-3 gives them   the first amount; rolling a 4-6 gives them the second). If there are any &quot;uninvited&quot; people in a player's room, he or she may also roll to &quot;get rid of&quot; them (by rolling a 4, 5 or 6) and either send each such person to another room or discard them (if they cannot be played to any other room).&#10;&#10;-If any of the player's in-hand Life cards are green Person cards, they may roll to &quot;call&quot; the person to their room. A successful roll (3-6) gets them invited in; otherwise, they are discarded. Some people are &quot;uninvited&quot; (causing bad things to happen), and may be placed without a roll in any player's room. (See above for &quot;getting rid of&quot; these people.) Pet cards, such as Cats (which don't require a roll to enter a room) and Dogs (which may or may not need to be &quot;called&quot;) can also be played in this round.&#10;&#10;-For each unit of free time the player's Job card gives them, they may perform one action (play a red Activity card) or go shopping (play any number of blue Thing cards). Some of these cards may have a cost; the total cost for all cards played in a round cannot exceed the income given to them by their Job card. (NOTE: Free Time and Income may be modified by certain Whenever cards played on the player by themselves or other players.)&#10;&#10;-At the end of a turn, if a player has more than five cards in hand, the player must discard cards until they have five or fewer. If desired, players can discard all the way down to one card. (NOTE: It is also legal for a player to play ALL the cards in their hand and have NO cards at the end of a turn.)&#10;&#10;-Additionally, some Life cards are orange &quot;Whenever&quot; cards which can be played at any time.&#10;&#10;-Activity cards and Thing cards typically list a Slack value which is added to the player's Slack total, though some have random Slack totals and some have Slack totals which vary during the game. TV Activity cards and some Whenever cards can be used to cancel cards as they are being played, and some cause previously-played cards to be discarded. Some cards add or subtract Slack from every player's total, while others cause a player to change their Job card (and hence Slack goal). Many cards alter the effects of other cards.&#10;&#10;The first player whose Slack total equals or exceeds their Slack goal is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Each Anno Domini set consists of 340 cards, with a description of a historical event on one side of the card, and the year (and sometimes specific date) in which it happened on the other.&#10;&#10;Each player receives nine of these cards (or less, if you want the game to be shorter), and may only look at the descriptions. Players then put in turn a card on the table, *trying* to put theirs in chronological order. A player may, instead of adding a card, claim that the order in which the cards were put is incorrect. In this case all cards are turned over and the correct years revealed.&#10;If the order was correct then the doubting player receives two cards and skips a turn. If the order was incorrect then the previous player, who accepted the order as correct, receives three cards. The first player that gets rid of all the cards wins.&#10;&#10;Bluffing is as least as important as knowledge in this game. Most events are rather obscure or are hard to date exactly, so this ain&rsquo;t no game for the nerds/geeks of this world, even they might think so, because it&rsquo;s full of surprises and pure fun. Highly Recommended, because Anno Domini is a blast to play, is a very enjoyable social event and you even learn something from it.&#10;&#10;Unfortunately there is no English edition in existence, but this game could be a good way, to improve your already existing German skills or a very good reason, to learn German language in the first place.&#10;&#10;The Set &quot;Anno Domini - Frauen&quot; contains historical events related to women. It can be played as a standalone or together with the other sets, which is the best way of playing it.&#10;&#10;Part of the Anno Domini series&#10;&#10;",

The storyteller position then rotates in clockwise order, and the next player begins their turn, continuing the story.&#10;&#10;Each turn brings the game closer to conclusion. When the endgame is triggered, the current storyteller must close the tale. Players have the option of using the &quot;Press Review System&quot;, which consists of four different tableaus featuring unique words: Creative, Bizarre, Engaging, Poetic. As each narrator finishes their turn, the rest of the players draw a cube from a common pool and place it on one of the four tableaus. Thus, at game's end, the tableau that has the most cubes determines the press reaction to the show (the story). On the back of each of them, there are fictional newspaper articles praising the players.&#10;&#10;The game is in Spanish, full languague dependence, and it has an icon system for the color blind.&#10;&#10;Each game takes 14 to 24 minutes.&#10;&#10;",

Each player begins with a blank card mat which is slowly filled with cards that represent different units of orcs, goblins, war machines, and treasure.  Each card has its own rules which affect play.&#10;&#10;Once a battle line is completed with a standard at the front, a musician at the rear, and all the spaces filled in between, it can be used to disrupt another player's unfinished battle line.  The games ends when a player has all three lines completed.  Each card has a point value which is then tallied and added to a bonus score for any completed battle lines.  The winner is the player with the highest score.  Also, many of the cards used to relate to old Citadel ork and goblin miniatures, in theory.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Chaos Marauders (Second Edition) (Fantasy Flight Games, 2009)(See summary of differences)&#10;&#10;&#10;",

You quickly set up perimeter force fields and begin surveying the surrounding terrain for debris from your ship, only to find it scattered everywhere. Then you see them &ndash; at first only a few &quot;bug&quot; scouts, but then the numbers begin to increase all around you: archers, slashers, and even the monstrous brutes. This is more than a scouting party; this is a war party! They begin to attack the shields as the crew starts to retrieve debris. The SOS has been sent and a ship in the sector has responded, but can it get to you before the &quot;bugs&quot; overwhelm your crew? Can you repair parts of the ship and use it as a defense? Can you repair the hull and fire up the engine to lift off? It's all in the hands of the crew &ndash; your hands.&#10;&#10;In Alien Uprising, the player crew must either hold off the Zothren attacks until the rescue ship arrives, or repair the ship and lift off from the hostile planet before being destroyed. To achieve either of these goals, the crew must work together, using their unique skills and chosen actions to perform a number of tasks, defend themselves, and retrieve and repair equipment and the ship.&#10;&#10;To establish the actions available each turn, the first player rolls custom dice, then each player chooses an action for the turn, starting with the first player. The available actions include combat, engineering, reload/recharge first aid, scout, and wild; the dice also have an alien icon that shows the speed of the enemy while limiting the actions that players have available to them. Players also have unique character skills, and the game can be set to higher levels of difficulty for more experienced players.&#10;&#10;",

Players build teams out of five robots to duke it out against other players' teams of five. It's designed to be easy to learn, affordable to buy, and quick to play, setting it apart from other strategy games.&#10;&#10;There are five different classes of robot: Assault, Evasive, Guard, Intel and Support, and dozens of robots in each of those Classes. Each Class has its own way of playing and interacting with other bots, and you can make a team out of any five of them for an infinite amount of possible strategies!&#10;&#10;The main mechanism of the game is teambuilding. Each robot on your team shares energy with each other, so moving and attacking with one will limit what the rest of your team can do during your turn. Certain compatible robots can combine into greater forms, too! If your team is built correctly, you can unite all five of your robots together to form something right out of your favorite giant robot cartoon!&#10;&#10;",

Practicing your dexterity, use your meeples to collect applause and earn points. You have to reproduce the figures requested by the public, stage the special arrangements of your guest stars, and raise your troop high in the air because it will bring as much applause as its height. The player with the most applause after three rounds wins.&#10;&#10;",

Huge planar gates are opening and hordes of powerful creatures are pouring into the land to fight the final battle for dominance. There can be only one winner!&#10;&#10;Ostium is a turn-based, deck building card game. Each player uses their planar gates to summon creatures that fight to destroy the gates controlled by other players. The creatures use their abilities and fight. Each creature has its own set of abilities, which grow more powerful, if the creature is supported by other creatures from its clan. The creatures can also fuse with energy channeled directly from a planar gate to deal crushing damage to the opponent&rsquo;s gates or creatures.&#10;&#10;Each turn has two phases. In the first phase, the player can bring more forces to the battlefield and use special abilities of the summoned creatures. The second phase is combat, where all the extra powers, channeled energy, and clan synergies lay waste to the enemy forces.&#10;&#10;The player can summon creatures directly to the battlefield (and place them in attack or defense rows) or the discard pile. The order in which the cards are placed in the deck, drawn, and played can decide the outcome of the game, since neither the deck, nor the discard pile are shuffled. The way the creatures are placed on the battlefield also greatly affects their abilities and power.&#10;&#10;Ostium was initially designed as a duel game, but you will also find solo mode and 3 player match rules described in the official game rule book. A typical game usually takes 30 to 45 minutes.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The major varieties of Preference are Croatian, Austrian, and Russian and there are variations of each as well.  Generally a three player game, a fourth player can play by having the dealer of each hand sit out for the round.  Following is a brief description of the Croatian version of the game, and below are links to rule sets for the Croatian, Austrian, and Russian versions.&#10;&#10;Each of the suits has a predetermined value:&#10;Leaves = 2&#10;Bells = 3&#10;Hearts = 4&#10;Acorns = 5&#10;&#10;The dealer deals out all 32 cards - 10 to each player and 2 to the &quot;talon&quot; (crib).  Each player in turn bids one of the suits for trump, or can bid the value 6 game where the declarer(bid winner) can attempt to take no tricks and the other two must try to force him to do so, or the 7 game where there is no trump suit. The highest bid becomes the declarer, takes the two cards from the &quot;talon&quot; and discards two, and then must take 6 tricks to succeed in the game he bid for or a higher one.  The opposing players have the option to play in which they must get two tricks to succeed.  If only one player is opposing, he may request the aid of the other non-declaring player in an attempt to make the declarer fail in his bid, but takes all the bonuses or penalties for doing so.  Non bid hands means a double scoring round in the next hand, and &quot;kontra&quot; may be offered to double the stakes of a hand a player is confident in making the declarer fail (and can be &quot;rekontra&quot; and &quot;sukontra&quot; or doubled and doubled again and again!).&#10;&#10;The players start out with a set number of points (usually 100 each) and the game goes until the total of all three players equals zero.  Tricks taken when opposing a contract score some points for the player and against those players in the final tally.  &#10;&#10;&#10;",

An alliance of Dwarves and Humans are pitted in a battle of survival against the evil hordes of Goblins and the nefarious Undead. To win, players recruit massive armies, build cities, develop technology, and conquer territory in an effort to defeat their opponents by ultimately capturing their homeland. Beyond the mere battling of armies and world conquest, players direct the development of heroes to explore dungeons, battle fierce creatures, and gain valuable treasure and spells that can be used to turn the tides of war against their foes.&#10;&#10;Player turns are broken into three phases:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Movement Phase: An army can move all of their units during this phase.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Combat Phase: An army engages in all battles and resolves all dungeons on this phase.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Collection &amp; Placement Phase: An army marks all new territories they have conquered with their control markers, adjusts their new income level. An army spends their money on new units, develops or researches the ability to acquire new units, builds new cities and/or upgrades their capital city.&#10;&#10;&#10;To win players must either destroy an enemy capital city or achieve an economic victory.&#10;&#10;",

You will take on the role of a hero set out to recover treasure, slay monsters, and find a place for yourself in the retelling of Greek myths. The game is played with a set of (initially) 30 cards that represent the monsters, treasures, and gods will become the tale of your adventure. This deck, and your character, will change and grow as you play more games, which is meant to reflect how tales become more embellished and outlandish each time they are told.&#10;&#10;Each turn you flip over the top three cards of the adventure deck. These cards represent monsters, treasures, and the favors of the gods. You must then allocate your crew members to each of the cards. After all of your crew have their tasks, you roll against each card. The more crew members you have on a card, the likelier you are to resolve it positively. Monsters are defeated and treasures are won. Fail the roll and treasures will be lost to you, and monsters will send your crew members to Hades. As you are among the crew, once they have all died you will also be on your way to meet Charon.&#10;&#10;Once the deck has been exhausted, the adventure is complete and you have won! The game is not over however. After each successful retelling of your adventures, the story grows! Much like tales become taller every time they are told, the adventure deck will become more legendary each time you win.&#10;&#10;All of the cards in the game will have check boxes on them that will be used to represent the level of the card. Cards that were defeated or captured after a successful adventure will be marked: monsters will become stronger and treasures will lose durability. Some monsters will even bring reinforcements into your deck.&#10;&#10;Additionally, so that the player may keep up, the player can also level up after successful adventures. This allows the player to start games with a larger crew and add new items to the deck.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "This game is about the struggle for power and influence in cities by the competing guilds of the age. Players represent one city colour &amp; have a set of tiles in 3 shapes in your colour and a set of cards for each city plus 4 action cards. You play a card and place a tile either from your set or from the church or neutral sets. The starting player also first draws a card from a central deck which effectively gives them an extra move. Tiles of the same colour cannot touch and the church tiles allow cities to expand.&#10;&#10;When a city is completed, it is scored. The colour with the most tiles gets the 1st score, the second colour gets half that, the next gets 4 points and the fourth colour gets 2 pts. Therefore it is possible for the neutral colour to score more points than players. The score is a total of the tiles in the city, plus one for each church, plus one for each cathedral place.&#10;&#10;The action cards let you pick up your discards, place a tile to be fixed later, and go first twice (which are discarded). The draw deck cards can be held to score extra points at the end.&#10;&#10;At first the game seems pedestrian, but within a few turns the possibilities become more obvious. Judicious use of the pick-up and turn order cards make a big difference. Not spreading too widely and using the neutral tiles to devalue other cities also matters.&#10;&#10;An interesting placement game that the designer Wolfgang Panning took 2 1/2 years to complete. The choice of Flanders mattered to him because the theme is of city guilds, such as Weavers, who fought to control the cities.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "In December 1944 Hitler launched a massive offensive against the weakly held Ardennes forest section of the Allied front in Belgium. Achieving complete surprise, the Germans nevertheless faced tough resistance from the battle's opening days, and the offensive was virtually over 10 days after it began. There followed a bloody Allied counterattack which gradually erased the bulge the Germans had created in the Allied line.&#10;&#10;But you probably know all that. Yet another Battle of the Bulge game? Why yes. But one with a different approach. Specifically, award-winning designer Ted S. Raicer has taken a modified version of the chit pull system pioneered in GMT's The Dark Valley: The East Front 1941-45 and brought it west for an exciting new take on this classic wargame subject.&#10;&#10;The scale of the map (which takes up about 2/3rds of a standard 22&rdquo; by 34&rdquo; map sheet, the rest given to tracks, charts and tables) is at 3 miles to the hex.  Allied units are mostly regiments and brigades, ,with most German armor and infantry divisions divided into two kampfgruppen (battle groups),  German artillery, Greif commando teams, infantry trucks, and the Von der Heydte paratroop unit are included as Asset markers, as are Allied artillery, scratch units, and engineers.&#10;&#10;The game runs from December 16 1944 to January 16 1945 when the Allies reunited their divided front by recapturing the key town of Houffalize.  Each turn through December 31st equals 2 days and the turns in January are three days long. The full campaign lasts thirteen turns while a scenario for just the German offensive is six turns long. But with The Deadly Woods' chit system and its multiple Action Rounds, a lot can happen in only six turns.&#10;&#10;Each side gets a number of Action Chits each turn, which vary both in number and type.  These include multiple Reinforcement chits which determine the arrival Round (but not Turn) of Allied and German reinforcements. There are German Logistics Chits which introduce historical supply effects. There are Movement or Combat chits which allow a player to choose. There are also Movement chits and Combat chits which limit the Active Player to the capability listed on the chit. And there are special chits, such as the German 5th Panzer and Allied Patton chits that allow some combination of Movement and Combat.&#10;&#10;After the Initiative Player chooses the first chit played, the remaining chits are drawn randomly from a cup. A player may draw up to two consecutive chits and then enemy player must get the next chit.&#10;&#10;Armor is severely limited in moving through other units along roads and bridges and at projecting ZOC into woods terrain. Combat may result in losses, retreats, surrender, or stalemate.&#10;&#10;Each turn should take roughly an hour for players who know the rules.  The German Player can win an instant victory by exiting units off the north map edge west of the Meuse or by holding 5 objectives at the end of a turn.  Otherwise the game is won on geographic Victory Points. (The Germans also gets Victory Points for crossing the Meuse in supply, even if they are forced back across the river, so he has a reason to push even when the arrival of the British makes an Instant Victory impossible.)&#10;&#10;So another Bulge game, but one with the historical action and decisions of games with a much bigger footprint and playing time. And with a unique take on the chaos and friction of the battle that makes it a great choice for solo play. Even if you are bulged out, you'll want The Deadly Woods in your collection!&#10;&#10;Components&#10;22&quot; x 34&quot; map&#10;1.5  5/8&quot; countersheets&#10;Rulebook&#10;Player aids&#10;Playbook&#10;Game box or ziploc&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

The game was expanded by metal miniatures sold separately in blister packs, but these are no longer available. The rules to include these are included in the game box.&#10;&#10;",

On a turn, you can capture one of the opponent's dice in one of two ways:&#10;&#10;&bull; Have one die with a value equal to or higher than the value of the captured die; take the die, then reroll the die used to make the capture.&#10;&bull; Sum the values of multiple dice to equal the value of the captured die; reroll all of the dice used to make the capture.&#10;&#10;If you can't capture a die on your turn, you pass. The game ends once no one can capture any more dice. A player's score is the sum of the sides of the dice they captured, plus half the sum of the sides of dice they own that weren't captured. Whoever has the highest score wins!&#10;&#10;Button Men: Beat People Up is a new version of Button Men that depicts characters on cards instead of stickpin buttons, but the basic gameplay is the same, and characters from the different releases can still fight one another.&#10;&#10;This game is set in Fight City, a 1950s gangster town somewhere on the Gulf Coast. The Fight City set is divided into four factions, each with a different style of play. Those from Downtown (&quot;The Core&quot;) use normal dice only. Characters from The West Side have Shadow dice, which make attacks upside-down. Those from the Delta region use Poison dice, which are worth negative points. And characters from the Hill (&quot;Uptown&quot;) have Rush dice, which give those characters more chances to make the first move.&#10;&#10;",

This resulted in a five-way race in which the Democrats actually won and the third party, the Progressives came in second.&#10;&#10;The election is represented by a straightforward, card driven, geographically based game where the winners of each state are decided by lot.

    "description": "Mont&eacute;limar: Anvil of Fate, On August 15, 1944, the Allies invaded the South of France in Operation Dragoon. Major General Truscott's U.S. VI Corps landed along a 45 mile stretch of French Coast with the objective of isolating the major German forces defending the western part of France and linking up with the Normandy forces breaking out of their beachhead. The southern beachhead would be secured in only 2 days and the Americans were well established inland. With scattered and only occasionally strong resistance, the Americans and now landed French advanced north up the Rhone valley along highway N-7 &mdash; heading quickly toward the key rail and road junction at Aix-en-Provence. This was captured on August 19th. At this point, General Truscott activated a provisional force called Task Force Butler. This roughly regimentally sized unit raced ahead of the main force with the objective of capturing the main route of escape for the German Army. The Task Force set up a defensive position in the high ground to the north of Mont&eacute;limar. They were to hold until relieved. The Germans would throw everything they could at Task Force Butler in a race to return to Germany before the larger Allied Formations coming up from the south and east would join Task Force Butler.&#10;&#10;In the end, both sides could claim victory &mdash; the Allies mauled the enemy forces with the Germans suffering 2100 casualties with several thousand soldiers and large amounts of heavy equipment unable to escape. The Allies suffered only 1200 casualties but much of the German Army did get away and a great opportunity was lost.&#10;&#10;Mont&eacute;limar: Anvil of Fate is the third game in the Company Scale System and the first game in the Liberation series covering battles in Western Europe in 1944 and 1945.

Each die is covered with six kinds of Egyptian archeological treasures, the artifacts of Pharaoh Teubernus: a gold lamp, a gold coin, a scarab beetle, a lapis lazuli vase, a piece of gold and jade jewelry, and a hippo statuette.&#10;&#10;A player can collect any treasure tile that matches the symbols he or she has rolled. For strategic reasons, a player might be better off rerolling some or all of his or her dice to try to match a particular shape and pattern of tile. Players can roll the dice up to three times in all per turn. &#10;Players can rotate treasure tiles in any direction when placing them on their excavation site grids, but they may not move the tiles once they are laid down. Tiles cannot overlap one another or hang beyond the edges of a board. &#10;The first player to cover his or her excavation site board completely with treasure tiles wins the game.&#10;&#10;In an easier version of the game, players are allowed to shift their treasure tiles around after placing them down, which makes it less difficult for kids to pick and use additional tiles to cover the board.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Early Klaus Teuber game with a well deserved reputation, from a publisher better known for electronic games! The odd combination of mechanisms is a bit tricky to grasp at first, but soon reveals a nice contest. There are various ships in different colors marked on the board and players are dealt 3 random cards to show a share in three of the ships. Also on the board are treasure chests with rising values, and colored markers for each ship move from chest to chest, showing the worth of that vessel. Players begin with cash, 3 Smithy &amp; 3 Trade card, and some lucky horseshoes that they keep on a rack hidden from the other players. These are variously numbered and two dice are rolled at each turn to provide the lucky number.&#10;&#10;As the Flying Dutchman sails the seven seas, it can either move onto islands or the ships. If it is moved onto a ship, players reveal if they are share holders and pay the current value back to the bank as its marker is moved down to zero. On your turn, you can opt to use your Trade card to exchange 2 of your share cards, effectively dodging the Dutchman's threat. Or you can play a Smithy card, to allow you to take horseshoes at the end of the turn. But mainly you can attempt to control the Dutchman's move, by secretly laying down horseshoes to match the lucky number, the closest winning control. A nice rule, if there's a tie, the players are meant to try to agree, then barter, and finally compete with more horseshoes (all to the benefit of the Smithy card players!). Played horseshoes are pooled until Smithies divy them up.&#10;&#10;If the Dutchman is moved to an island, the controlling players reveal a share card and take the value of that ship from the bank. The round ends with all the chest markers moving up once, including a black marker, which ends the game when it reaches the highest chest. Players reveal their share cards and take the final value on the chests, most money wins.&#10;&#10;Puzzling to begin with, but you quickly realize whether your shares are under threat from a Dutchman's move, so you either trade out or try to gain control. If you're not under threat, it may be worth use your Smithy to grab the pool of horseshoes. Get your timing right and the whole thing becomes very rewarding. Simple choices, not perfectly balanced, but the players at times co-operate or struggle, making for an entertaining voyage.&#10;&#10;Winner of the 1992 Deutscher Spiele Preis.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Talat, originally published in an all-wood edition under the name Drei, is an abstract strategy game specifically designed for three players. Each pair of players shares a game board, forcing each player to pay attention to two different gaming scenarios at once. The goal is to capture the opponents' pieces and to move your own pieces to the opponents' starting rows.&#10;&#10;Players have nine towers in three heights and three shapes (squared, hexagonal and triangular prisms). To set up the game, players lay out the game boards, then take turns placing towers one by one on the starting edges of their game boards, five towers on one board and four on the other.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player must move one tower one space forward, either straight or diagonally; the player can choose freely which tower to move on which game board, but moving on one board precludes movement on the other, so choose wisely! A tower can capture another tower by moving onto its space, but only in the right circumstances. If the two towers are the same height, the capturing tower must have more sides than the one being captured; if their heights differ, the capturing tower must be one level taller than the tower being captured. The exception is the smallest triangular tower, which can capture the opponent's tallest hexagonal tower. A tower can also move sideways when capturing, but not when merely moving on the game board; thus, even after a tower reaches the opponent's back row, it might still be at risk of capture (or possibly the one doing the capturing).&#10;&#10;If no captures are possible on a game board, that board is frozen and players can no longer move their pieces on it. As soon as two boards are frozen, the game ends. Players score five points for each tower they've captured and three points for each of their own towers that has reached an opponent's starting edge. The player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;",

Through social grooming, these apes remove dirt, insects, and debris from the difficult-to-reach and difficult-to-see places of each other&rsquo;s fur. Reciprocation is expected and awarded in this kind of monkey business! The player who acquires the most diverse and exotic collection of groomed goods will earn the respect of their fellow primates and be awarded the golden banana of victory.&#10;&#10;In Gussy Gorillas, players start out with a personal deck of face-down cards. Without looking at the card(s) in their hand, players simultaneously trade or keep their hand, one or two cards at a time, to form a personal collection. Once all cards have been traded or kept, players tally their collections and the highest score wins &mdash; but pairs can cancel out and special cards are not always helpful, so trade carefully!&#10;&#10;Similar to the popular game Hanabi, in Gussy Gorillas players hold their cards facing away from themselves...but instead of being a co-operative memory game, this is a competitive negotiation and bluffing game. Things get even more interesting once players realize that every card can either be very good or very bad for one's collection, depending on the context. You'll have to convince your opponents to keep bad cards for themselves and give great cards to you if you want to swing away with the win...&#10;&#10;&mdash;Description from the Publisher&#10;&#10;",

Whenever a player goes over the limit, the right-hand player gets an island card. When a player announces a number that another player has in hand as an island card, then he&rsquo;s put his foot in it and receives a Fettnapf card. The game ends when a player has collected 4 Fettnapf cards. The winner is the player with the fewest Fettnapf cards.&#10;&#10;",

For example: the Spawn space adds pesky tentacles that slow your opponents down, and the Lair space controls the Kraken's tentacles. Combining your hand of cards with your movement allows you to string together combos &mdash; propelling you toward the final goal. Don't wait too long for the perfect combo &ndash; the board will fill up quickly with tentacles, and the Kraken is always hungry!&#10;&#10;The Refuge: Terror from the Deep also features new 1-4 player solo and cooperative gameplay in which players work together to defeat the Kraken!
