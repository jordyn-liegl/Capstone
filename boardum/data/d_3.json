Lean into those iconic (yet unspoken) Monopoly moments in which rules are bent, money is borrowed, and funny business is welcomed. The outlandish suggestions on the board, cards, and rules encourage players to express their inner cheater to own it all while they buy, sell, dream, and scheme. Fake a die roll, steal some bills from the bank, and even skip out on rent. Complete a cheat to get a reward, but fail a cheat and pay the consequences! No houses in this edition &ndash; only hotels &ndash; and pretend handcuff unit may leave players &quot;chained&quot; to the board. The Hasbro Gaming, Parker Brothers, and Monopoly names and logos, the distinctive design of the gameboard, the four corner squares, the Mr. Monopoly name and character, as well as each of the distinctive elements of the board and playing pieces are trademarks of Hasbro for its property trading game and game equipment.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

They place their selected hero on their left to begin their Hero stack and start their Villain stack on their right.  The hero/villain cards have a base number on the top left, and each turn, players play one card (and replenish their hand) to modify the values of their or their opponent's stacks by multiplication, addition, or subtraction.  Certain cards give effects that negate certain cards or discard an opponent's cards.&#10;&#10;When the values of a player's hero and villain stack are both 10 points greater than their opposing stacks, he or she calls out &quot;Last chance!&quot;  The game ends in victory for the player at this point if the opponent is unable to reduce the deficit by playing a card.&#10;&#10;",

When all sets have been melded, most points wins.&#10;&#10;From The Card Games Website&#10;This is Go Fish without the stock pile. All the cards are dealt out as equally as possible to the players. A turn consists of asking a player for a rank (or a specific card if you play that version). If they have it your turn continues; if not the turn passes to the player you asked. As in Go Fish, you must have a card of the rank you asked for. Books of 4 cards are discarded. The game continues until all the cards are formed into books, and whoever gets most books wins - or you can score one point per book and play to a target score.&#10;&#10;This game is often paired in the same deck with Top Trumps&#10;&#10;Happy Families - An even earlier (1851), British version with the educational theme centered on family members and their occupations.&#10;&#10;Quartett - This is the German equivalent of Happy Families or Authors. Many different designs of cards were made for this game in the late nineteenth and throughout the twentieth century, with various educational or other themes.&#10;&#10;",

As a bonus, it helps kids with shape recognition and colors. Switch on the circular pond, and the ducks start swimming&ndash;the bottom side of each duck has a colored shape. Players take turns picking up a duck and looking at the color and shape; if it matches their color and shape they get to keep the duck. If it doesn&rsquo;t match they put it back. The ducks continue to swim so it&rsquo;s more challenging than a traditional memory game, but easy enough for even the youngest duck lovers to play. This extra challenge makes the game more fun for parents and kids to play together, with plenty of opportunities for fun and learning. For 2-4 players ages 3 and up. Includes motorized &ldquo;pond,&rdquo; 12 ducks, and complete instructions. Requires 2 AA batteries (not included).&#10;&#10;",

You must be vigilant and find your allies before your enemies can unite against them or you.&#10;&#10;Players control coloured pawns that represent characters from early in the Buffy TV series, both good (Buffy, Giles, Xander, Willow, and Cordelia) and evil (The Master, Drusilla, and Spike). The twist is, no-one knows which pawn you control, or which character it represents. At the start of the game each player is given a colour card and a character card, kept secret from the other players. Unowned colours and characters are still in play, not controlled by any player. Each turn players can choose to move any pawn they wish, not just the colour they control. When you move a pawn into a space that's already occupied, you may choose one player (or unowned group of colour and character cards) and ask to see their colour. If that colour pawn is present in the space you just moved to, you may ask to see their character card. You cannot reveal this information to the other players. Once this phase is complete, anyone who controls a pawn in that same space may reveal their colour and character cards to everyone and start a fight. The losing side has to drop a character involved in the combat (and the associated player, if any) from the game. Play continues until it's established that all remaining players are on the same side.&#10;&#10;Same theme and nearly identical name, but a different game from Buffy the Vampire Slayer: The Game.&#10;&#10;",

Many boxed versions with suggestions and timers are available, and several TV shows have been made using the basic idea of the game.&#10;&#10;In most versions, one player silently acts out a title (book, movie, show, etc.), phrase or person and their team must guess it. The words can be from a commercially made list or just creatively made up by the players. Many signals and conventions have become traditional (see link below). The experience is usually humorous, whether you are strenuously flapping away like a buzzard - alternating with pretending to push a buzzer and lying dead on the floor - for several minutes while your team guesses everything but buzzard (&quot;bird!&quot; &quot;scavenger!&quot; &quot;bird of prey!!&quot; &quot;raptor?&quot;) or frantically struggling to think up clever clues. Many of the clues use the &quot;sounds like&quot; hint - pretending to sew for the word &quot;so,&quot; for example. The excitement and frustration of piecing together the clues and guessing is also a great part of the fun, of course, and the relief is immense for both the actor and the guessing team when the guess is finally (or miraculously suddenly) correct. The game usually produces much laughter in the group playing it - solving the riddles is only part of the experience.&#10;&#10;",

Community chest cards describe activities that support women, like publishing an article on successful women entrepreneurs or watching the newest superhero movie with a female lead. Such cards will award more money to male players than to female players.&#10;&#10;The properties on the board have been replaced by inventions made by women.&#10;&#10;The mascotte for the game is Ms. Monopoly, who is a niece of Rich Uncle Pennybags and an advocate whose mission is to invest in female entrepreneurs.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;&#10;     MEET MS.

    "description": "Dread Pirate is an elegantly presented family game focusing on pirate lore and like any good Pirate the one with the most loot wins.&#10;&#10;Each of the pirates start in their own port with a few doubloons and jewels of their own color. The rest of that color of jewel are piled near their port and the remaining doubloons are piled on &ldquo;Dread Island&rdquo; in the center of the map, along with the &lsquo;fate&rsquo; cards that are drawn when sailing through specific marked areas of the board. It is these pirates goal to sail to the other ports and either raid or trade for jewels of the other colors. Once a pirate has at least one jewel of each color they can land on that Dread Island and collect some free doubloons. &quot;Skirmishes&quot;can be had with other pirates at sea and may slow the journey, but the reward of treasure can be great. Once all the jewels are gone from the original piles in the home ports (some will accumulate on Dread Island), the game is over and everyone counts the swag in their pouch.&#10;&#10;The 2002 Signature Edition of this game is packaged in a wooden treasure chest and includes a board in the form of an aged treasure map, three wooden dice, four treasure sacks, four die cast metal ships, one wooden wind cube, fifty-two Dread Pirate cards, four map cards, fifty replica doubloons, 120 treasure jewels, 1st Edition rulebook, and captain&rsquo;s log. The chest and rule book are also marked &quot;Old Century Classics&quot;.&#10;The 2003 Signature Edition is identical with the exception that it only has 100 jewels, and a 2nd Edition Rulebook and is marked &quot;Front Porch Classics&quot; instead of &quot;Old Century Classics&quot;.&#10;The 2007 Signature Edition differs from the 2003 version in that it has a 3rd Edition rulebook, a Jolly Roger flag, and the four map cards are discontinued.&#10;The cloth map has extra anchor icons identical to the ones seen in Buccaneer's Revenge, and the game comes in a black wooden chest instead of a brown one. It is also marked &quot;copyright Sababa Group&quot;, instead of Front Porch Classics.&#10;&#10;The Bookshelf Edition is packaged in a wooden bookshelf box and includes all of the components of the 2003 Signature Edition, plus a Jolly Roger flag. The rulebook is marked &quot;Bookshelf Edition&quot;. The Copyright 2003 Bookshelf edition rulebook is otherwise identical to the 2nd edition treasure chest rules.&#10; The 2007 Bookshelf Edition, which was marketed by Sababa Toys, has a rulebook that corresponds to the 2007 Signature Edition. It only has 45 gold pieces instead of the 50 seen in all previous editions. The coins are also smaller, and the cloth map is smaller than the one seen in the Signature Edition.&#10;Sababa Group editions of the game are also marked &quot;Copyright 2007 Sababa Group&quot; on the Dread Pirate cards and on the inside box lid.&#10;&#10;",

Victory is by reducing the opponent to 20 combat factors or occupying all of the opposing cities.

The demo rulebook made available was mostly a straight-up copy of the Massive Darkness rulebook.&#10;&#10;Overturn is tactical combat based RPG board game with co-op elements to it. It uses a rich Middle Eastern folklore as a backdrop to tell its story which is ingrained with supernatural elements, legends and conspiracies.&#10;&#10;The game uses a multiboard system to depict major scenarios with each major scenario ultimately ending after defeating its boss. The objective to win is simple: defeat all the bosses to reach the final boss and win the game. This can be done all on its own but it&rsquo;s the coop element that makes Overturn unique. Each board or primary mission can be completed with multiple heroes and players yet each player has the option to pursue their own version of the story on the board and the choice to assist other players or not.&#10;&#10;The combat is turn based with the enemies having their own unique AI that makes them formidable as well as unpredictable. Players grow their levels by defeating enemies and learning new skills and increasing their power. This applies to enemies too who grow just as much tough as the player grows bolder.&#10;&#10;",

Like many ancient abstract strategy games, the number of pieces and their starting positions varies from region to region but the general play of the game is the same: one player controls a single piece, the fox, the other player controls the geese (usually 13 to 17).  The fox player tries to remove all of the geese from the board by jumping them.  The geese player tries to prevent this from happening by pinning down the fox so that it cannot move.&#10;&#10;The game of Solitaire can be played on a Fox &amp; Geese board, and some sets include additional markings for playing Asalto = Siege.&#10;&#10;There are some claims that Fox and Geese is related to an earlier game called Halatafl, but there is as yet no concrete definition of what exactly this game was or how it was played.  There are also several contemporary games using the Halatafl name, at least one of which is played on a similar board to Fox and Geese but with differing rules.&#10;&#10;https://av.getinfo.de/media/11310?2 ( CC Attribution - NonCommercial - NoDerivatives 3.0 )&#10;http://vimeo.com/51819749&#10;&#10;",

A Drinking Man's Thinking Game can be played as a drinking game, or other methods of 'penalties' can be agreed upon by players prior to game play.  The cards also feature traditional poker symbols, so the cards may be used to play games such as Texas Hold 'Em, Poker, or a Wench variation utilizing the card mechanics.  Cards have 3 different categories, Stein (table cards), Barley (played only on a player's turn) and Wing (which can fly out of a player's hand at any time).  The game involves remembering what cards your opponents have that they may have shown during the game, or tricking them into breaking one of your rules or a rule that is in play so they must pay a penalty, and you can remove a card from your hand. The object of the game is to remove all cards from your hand and go 'out,' thereby making the player at the end of the night, who accumulated the most points, The Wench of the evening.  They will then have to pay an agreed upon punishment such as buy the beer or pizza, take out the garbage, etc.&#10;&#10;",

The objective is to move one of your player tokens to the 9th circle and defeat Lucifer.&#10;&#10;The initial setup is the outer ring of the board. Each tile is two rings and the tiles are numbered. Players take turns placing 3 of their player tokens on the tile of their choice.  Each tile corresponds to one of four resources.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of each player's turn, two dice are rolled.  A 7 brings a demon into play in a corner of that player's choice.  Any other number will result in some players gaining resources. Rolling doubles gives your regular allotment of resources, plus a resource of your choice.  Rolling 2 or 12 allows you to place a marker on one tile that either doubles or eliminates production for that tile.&#10;&#10;Players can use their resources to bring out new player tokens, buy new tiles for inner circles of hell, move themselves, descend deeper into hell, move others, flip tiles, or alter die rolls.  Players can trade resources with other players during their turn.  The lower circles of hell generate more resources (2 for 3/4, 3 for 5/6 and 4 for 7/8).&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player descends to the ninth level and defeats Lucifer by rolling a 10 or better on two dice.&#10;&#10;",

An age of legends, raw magic and conflicts in the lush jungles and steaming swamps that would one day become the Mediterranean Sea. Heroes from all over the continent embarked on a Homeric quest to save the world from the threat posed by Anastyr, the queen of dragons.&#10;&#10;Anastyr is a cooperative board game with miniatures for 1 to 4 players. Each player takes on the role of a powerful hero, and your team of heroes embarks on an incredible odyssey through a world where they will face hordes of enemies and monsters, wizards and warlords, all very different depending on the environment in which they live. Each hero has their own equipment and fighting style that will each evolve during the course of their journey; all hoping to be powerful enough to face the ultimate threat at the end of this epic, adventure-filled campaign! During their quest, heroes will ride a variety of mounts (horses, raptors, saber-toothed tigers and other exotic creatures) that will give them special advantages, and their combat skills and ability to coordinate with their companions will be tested constantly.&#10;&#10;Anastyr has some particularly immersive innovations, such as scrolling tiles, interchangeable magnetic mounts, and backdrops that turn your game board into a beautiful diorama. The game features a dynamic mix of playing cards and special dice to roll and introduces combat mechanics loosely based on brawler video games. Heroes eliminate their opponents by unleashing fearsome combos. But they will also be able to ravage the battlefield with their Fury, a devastating attack resulting from unleashing their rage that has accumulated over the course of the battle. Each hero has a unique deck, which reflects their individual fighting style. And in the campaign mode, this deck can be improved by the player by the addition of new cards they can choose which will reflect the evolution and the leveling up of the hero over time.&#10;&#10;Anastyr is easy to learn, but also fast, tactical... and brutal!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

It is not for a specific product or release. Versions will appear on the individual item pages.&#10;&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;This is a very simple CCG based on the movie Star Wars: Episode I.&#10;&#10;First, after shuffling, you see who goes first (usually drawing &quot;destiny&quot;) and then draw 6 cards from your reserve deck.  The player who goes first usually chose the planet to battle at first.  And, from these 6 cards, you then deploy up to 6 &quot;counters&quot; worth of cards from your hand.  These can be Locations (if you are on the same planet), weapons and characters.  There were also &quot;effect&quot; cards that could be deployed to the table to boost up your characters, power, equipment and # of counters per turn.&#10;&#10;Phase two is battling for the planet you are currently on.  You lay any battle cards in your hand down and pick up your deployed character and weapon cards.  These are arranged in the order of &quot;battle card, weapon card, character card.&quot;  With the cards in order from last (first character you want to battle with) to first (last character to be battled), you place them face down in a stack and you both turn over cards until you get to a character (in the case of weapons and battle cards).  Cards turned over before the character are attached to the character (weapons and such) if the character can use them.  If the character can not use them, then they are discarded.  If you have weapons, you total up the number of &quot;power dots&quot; (red dots) and draw destiny.  That is the top card of your reserve deck.  You then look at the small number on the &quot;die&quot; in the upper right hand corner of the card.  You add this power to the character.  Whichever character has more power wins and the loser discards his character and attached cards.  Damage is listed on the card that lost.  The loser then discards that many cards off the top of his or her deck.  Both players then turn over their cards in the fight deck for the next characters to fight, etc. If the attacker ends up with more characters then the defender then the defender discards 1 card for each.  The cards that survived the battle remain at the planet for the next round.&#10;&#10;The final phase is called even up.  Pick up your original hand and you may discard it before drawing back up to 6 cards then go back to phase one again.  If you have more than 6 cards in your hand, you have to discard down to 6.  If you have less than, and you wish to keep them, you then draw to equal 6.  If you are not satisfied with your hand, you can discard the whole thing and draw 6 fresh cards.&#10;&#10;If after a battle you are the only one with characters left on a planet you have won it and you move to the next planet which is chosen by the winner of the planet.  You can also &quot;surrender&quot; the planet.&#10;&#10;You win by controlling 2 of the 3 planets or by running your opponent out of cards.&#10;&#10;There are a lot of other little things involved but that is basically how the game goes.  The artwork on the cards is up to Deciphers usual very high standards.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "You pull from a regular deck of cards 4 of a kind for each person playing. Shuffle those all together and deal them out so each person has 4 cards. They can't look at them until the game starts though. Place spoons on the table (enough for all except one player). Position them fairly, so each person pretty much has the same chance to grab one. You have one person (this job rotates hand to hand) start calling out 'pass'. How you pass is to select one card from your hand, put it on the table face down next to the person on your right, then you pick up the card the person on your left put down. You keep doing this until 1) you get 4 of a kind or 2) someone else gets four of a kind. At this point you grab a spoon, and the person who doesn't get a spoon gets a 'pig' point. Once you get 3 pig points you are a hog. If you are a hog you have lost, but you can still be part of the game. Hogs can talk to game players, but if a game player talks to a hog they get a pig point. Of course the winner is the person left when everyone else is a hog.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "This game has completely different rules from the 1995 version, which was reissued in 2017 in a wooden box but with the same old rules. The rules also seem to be different from the 2019 playable prop replica. The focus of the new game is an actual jungle adventure.&#10;&#10;The 2021 version has similar wooden box, but the board now has  four undifferentiated pathways over a jungle scene with a waterfall and a volcano and other jungle details. The pawns now look like the rhinoceros figure from the original movie.  It comes with two regular six-sided dice, four six-sided &quot;challenge dice&quot;, 12 life tokens, and a sand timer. When the lid opens the two sides have the same text as the game in the original movie.&#10;&#10;It has a deck of 100 &quot;challenge cards&quot; and a green card reader which doesn't work very well. (There's also an electronic version that reads the text.) On the front of the card is a hidden riddle, from which you're supposed to guess one of 20 categories.&#10;&#10;On the back of the card is a &quot;challenge&quot;.  These range from the sort of dice rolling that was used in the old game to physical role-playing activities like jumping across an imagined chasm or racing to the refrigerator to get a piece of fruit and taking a bite before the timer runs out.  There are storytelling challenges like imagining there's a lion and telling how you'd get away from it, acting challenges like having the whole group howl like wolves, and trivia questions relating to the jungle.&#10;&#10;If you fail a challenge you lose a life token.  If any player loses three life tokens the group as a whole loses the game, but players can give their life tokens to another player.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "&quot;Mensch &auml;rgere Dich nicht&quot; is a very well known German board game, developed by Josef Friedrich Schmidt in 1907/1908. The game was issued in 1914 and sold about 70 million copies. It is similar to Parcheesi, but has several considerably different rules.&#10;&#10;In the most recent Mensch &auml;rgere Dich nicht:&#10;- You only roll with one die, not two. There are therefore no bonuses (which often give you choices in Parcheesi) and penalties for rolling doublets. Instead, you roll the die again if you rolled a 6.&#10;- You start the game with a pawn on your enter space.&#10;- It is much harder to enter a pawn after the beginning of the game. This happens on a 6 and it is compulsory. The probability is 16.67%, whereas the probability in Parcheesi to roll a 5 on one of two dice or with both dice together is considerably higher at 41.67%. So it is much less likely that you have more than one movable pawn which would present you with choices when you roll.&#10;- There are no bonuses for capturing opponent's pawns or for reaching home.&#10;- There are no safe places where you can't be captured by an opponent, not even your own enter space.&#10;- You have to move any pawn off your enter space first chance you get unless there are no more pawns in waiting to enter as well. Which also reduces the number of decisions you can make.&#10;- Blockades with two pawns of the same colour on a space aren't possible under the standard rules, they are only an optional variant.&#10;- The board is somewhat different, particularly there is no home path leading up to a home square.&#10;&#10;These differences are based on the rule PDFs of the  Mensch &#195;&#164;rgere dich nicht rules by Schmidt Spiele and the  Parcheesi rules by Hasbro (version from 2001).&#10;&#10;",

This is the maze that players must navigate every time they wish to save Sarah&rsquo;s baby brother. Each game is different with the blank card spaces being filled with the magical encounters and monsters that are depicted on the deck of cards that comes with the game, this ensures a great deal of replayability and unpredictability in the game, giving the Labyrinth its signature feel.&#10;&#10;The game consists of two distinct stages, one in which the group must adventure through the labyrinth trying to find the goblin city whilst keeping their willpower as high as possible (nobody wants to fall into the oubliette!), and a second stage in which the players must fight their way into Jareth's castle where Sarah must say the&nbsp;magical words that will release her brother.&#10;&#10;",

Devil Bunny hates the Earth, for reasons best left known to people who bother to think about such things, and has decided to have his revenge by releasing upon this world the most unsatisfying brand of saltwater taffy known to man.  You and your friends have devised a way to stop him, however.  By luring cute and cuddly little squirrels into the factory and getting them to gum up your works (presumably doing unpleasant things to the squirrel, too) you think you might be able to break yourself, thus foiling Devil Bunny's plot.  Sure, it's a half baked idea, but you're taffy pulling machines, not scientists.  Besides, Devil Bunny's plot isn't likely to succeed anyway.&#10;&#10;The game focuses on distribution of tokens (representing squirrels) in a linear fashion eventually leading to your machine.  However, on certain rolls of the dice, Devil Bunny will come out onto the board and repair (remove tokens from) a machine.

After determining who goes first, players choose the Robot Master's stage on which they wish to start the game. On your turn, flip over the challenge card to reveal your first challenge. You choose the dice you wish to use to pass the challenge, then play cards from your hand and use abilities from your character to blast, jump or run through the challenge. Your opponents can play cards from the Dr. Wily side of their hand to make your challenge more difficult, possibly doing damage or taking lives from you along the way. If you beat the challenge, you move forward on the stage a number of spaces determined by the challenge you defeated.&#10;&#10;Once all spaces are clear and you are face-to-face with the Robot Master, you enter the &quot;Boss Battle&quot;. You and your opponents now take turns battling each other until only one robot remains standing. If you are the victor, you take the Robot Master's powers from the character card, stacking it under your own character card. If you were the first player to defeat this Robot Master, you also gain its Trophy, which allows you to set a die to any face you wish in a future Challenge or Boss Battle.&#10;&#10;Play continues around the board until you have defeated enough Robot Masters to enter Dr. Wily's castle and face the final boss.

You will collect clues to track down creatures inside and outside Hogwarts.&#10;&#10;The objective is to obtain four cards that corresponds to one beast. Each turn, a player will roll the dice which will correspond to the number of spaces a player moves. When a player lands on a tile that indicates a type of a card (Color, Size, Location or M.O.M Classification), they get to take one card from that pile. The card is then placed facedown. Should you obtain another card of that type, you place the new card on top of the other card. The dice ranges from 2-6 with one of the sides showing a &quot;P&quot;. When this side is rolled, the player who rolled it, gets to go to a passage (location space marked with a &quot;P&quot;) of his/her choice. All other players not on a &quot;P&quot; are temporarily removed. The game board then shifts and the player who rolled the &quot;P&quot; are able to put the other players on any tile of his/her choosing and can steal one of their cards. First player who obtains all four cards of each type for one magical beasts wins.&#10;&#10;",

In the other version of the game, the player who has active caps left on the board is the winner.&#10;&#10;According to Miscellaneous Game Book this was first published in 1927 by Otto Maier Verlag.
