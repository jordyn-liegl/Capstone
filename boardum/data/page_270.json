You may also steal treasures from the other players.&#10;&#10;From the beginning you have 8 different equipment cards, which you need to use to pass traps or defeat monsters. Sometimes you might lose 1 or more of your pieces of equipment, but there's a possibility to get them back at a couple of places on the board.&#10;&#10;The most remarkable thing about this game is that the board is in 6 parts, connected with roads in many combinations, The only way of reaching two of the parts is by jumping into one of the whirlpools in the middle of the board, This allows the board to be folded in or out to another board. There are rules to handle the other players if they get caught on the folded board.&#10;&#10;",

If one of your girls fails a health exam, she is off the street. A clean bill of health brings her back. You can steal girls from other pimps or steal their Johns. You can get more girls too. This is a good thing, since each girl will only work for you four times.&#10;&#10;Each John is described by a profession or some characteristic. For example there is a Gardener John, a British John, and a Rancher John. Each card describes what services he desires (with some interesting euphemisms), and how much he pays for a trick. Some Johns have favorites. These Johns will pay triple. The above Johns' favorites are the Garden Ho, the Tally Ho, and the Westward Ho.&#10;&#10;",

Find hidden bombs and dismantle them, help hostages into safety, or take out terrorist leaders. Due to the high variation in goals, targets, threats and specific circumstances, players need to choose their set-up and strategy each time they start a mission or a campaign. Don't just throw in grenades with your buster at public places such as airports and train stations, or else civilians might get hurt, resulting in negative points on your mission balance. (Plus, you know, injuring civilians is not cool.) Develop your primary skill, but don't neglect your attack power, defense power and other skills if you want to stay alive in this thrilling new game.&#10;&#10;Countdown: Special Ops is fully modular, with players being able to create their own game by adjusting four different aspects of play:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Game situations: With more than 200 playing cards, the challenges and threats are different each time you play.&#10;     Game mode: You can play a single mission, a campaign or a scenario; each game mode has its own level and duration, and you're advised to start with a single mission on the lowest level (green).&#10;     Level up: Did you succeed a few times on level green? If so, you might want to try the next (orange) level or even a scenario, that is, three missions in a row with increasing difficulty!&#10;     Goals: Even players' goals can be altered. Countdown: Special Ops is a co-operative game, but if you'd like to change the rules, you could add one or two traitors to the team and play &quot;Traitor Mode&quot;.&#10;&#10;&#10;Development&#10;You can develop your own Special Op by improving his or her skills. This is done in scenario or campaign play. This brings out interesting aspects of the game in which you have to choose how many risk you want to take to gain extra experience or if you want to move slow and stay alive at all cost...&#10;&#10;This variation, combined with the 30-minute time limit per mission, makes the experience of a mission &quot;feel&quot; like an actual PC game in many aspects. Smart development is essential to survive the missions on higher threat levels.&#10;&#10;",

The answers are given based on the map provided, so your answer is basically a geographical area which you feel applies to the question or statement.&#10;&#10;The game is supplied with a reticle (map-reader), which provides you with the letter needed if you want to answer with &quot;triangular precision&quot;.  So you must answer with a number (for hexagonal precision) or a number and a letter (for triangular).  The four sides of the pyramid are earned by answering a question with triangular precision, one for each zone on the map (Americas, Europe, Water, and Universal - which is Africa, Asia and the other 3 zones).&#10;&#10;The rubi (top of the pyramid) is earned by first having the four sides done, then answering a final question.  The zone is determined by rolling the rubi like a die, as the zones are inscribed on the rubi piece.&#10;&#10;",

Probability charts reveal the outcome of various game functions.&#10;&#10;Contents: 48-page rules booklet; 16-page booklet of additional rules &amp; scenarios; 72-page chart booklet; 700 die-cut cardboard playing pieces; eight 8-1/2&quot; x 11&quot; soft map sections; and various play aids.&#10;&#10;Level of Complexity: Very High&#10;Average Playing Time: 2 hours&#10;Suitability for Solitaire Play: Very Low&#10;&#10;&#10;(BGG description:)&#10;&#10;At one point called the most complicated wargame ever.

The game for all its detail is not without controversy as to realism. The energy rules and the claim that some aspects of the game are based on educated guesses because of the info on some planes being top secret, have caused this feeling of fudging.&#10;&#10;All in all one of SPI's most ambitious projects.

    "description": "Touring is a card game with the theme of an automobile trip. Players are competing to be the first one to complete a prescribed set of mileage cards. In all versions of the game you need 16 mileage cards to win. From lowest to highest value cards, the required counts are 8, 4, 2 and 2. Other players will try to slow you down by playing cards against you which cause you to lose mileage cards, or to play &quot;problem&quot; cards which you must remove by playing a corresponding &quot;remedy&quot; card.&#10;&#10;The game can be played in partnership for the 4- and 6-player versions, with each partnership playing as a single driver.&#10;&#10;Touring was originally published in 1906 by the Touring Card Company, then sold by Wallie Dorr, and then later picked up by Parker Brothers in 1924. Winning Moves Games currently (2015) holds the trademark for and publishes Touring.  If the mechanics sound familiar, it is the inspiration for the game Mille Bornes, which has since become more popular.&#10;&#10;As driving technology improved, card names and depicted mileage values became outdated and were thus replaced with longer distances.  There are multiple sets of rules, which reflect these changes.  A recent edition added some card categories.&#10;&#10;The action card types are different between Touring and Mille Bornes. For example, Mille Bornes adds the &quot;protective&quot; cards, e.g. Emergency Vehicle which allows you to ignore speed limits. Thus in Mille Bornes a player has more decisions to make.&#10;&#10;See also:&#10;&#10;     The Lindy Flying Game - A 1927 Nucraft Toys version of Touring based on Charles Lindbergh's flight across the Atlantic.  &#10;     Lindy, the New Flying Game - 1927 Parker Brothers sequel where Touring card play has been themed on Charles Lindbergh's flight across the Atlantic.&#10;     Mille Bornes - A similar game to Touring, first published in 1954.&#10;     Wings: The Air Mail Game - Another &quot;flying&quot; game like Lindy, but card deck split into two parts with different colors.&#10;     Stap op - The Dutch adaptation (bikes!) of the classic game Touring, from 1950 and still published today.&#10;&#10;&#10;Stap op is the Dutch adaptation (bikes!) of the classic American game Touring (cars!).&#10;&#10;",

In it, the players, employees of a huge corporation, compete to avoid promotion and remain competent (by taking more &quot;right&quot; decisions than &quot;wrong&quot; ones). At the same time, each tries to force the others into promotion or into &quot;deadwood&quot; status (which happens by accumulating enough wrong decisions and being found out). The last player still alive and competent is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;The game was originally published by Skor-Mor in 1973, but the 1981 AH edition is much easier to find.&#10;&#10;Skor-Mor published 3D puzzles and games in clear plastic such as Chess in the Third Dimension and a 3D Tic-Tac-Toe called Trinary.

On other spaces, the player may have to collect a 'Letter' which could call them away from the Abbey, slowing them down or costing them bells! And which route will they take? A short easy looking one to get a job done earning only one bell, or a longer route with the possibility of collecting a higher reward?&#10;&#10;The winner is the player who has completed all their jobs and collected the most bells.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Theme:&#10;&#10;Game is themed around a purification ritual of the ancient Etruscan people, who predated the Roman Empire around 6th century B.C.  Each player represents a different temple, faithful to the divinities Achvizr, Alpan, Leinth, and Thalna.  On &quot;Tagete's&quot; day, the Etruscan Haruspexes [priests] proceed down the path of purification to the Velthumena Altar.&#10;&#10;Goal:&#10;&#10;Each player has 8 pawns representing &quot;Haruspexes&quot; [priests] in their color.  Each player is trying to move their priests along the path of purifiction from their home temple to the altar at the center of the board.  One player may also choose the path of darkness and consecrate themselves to the divinity &quot;Tuchulcha&quot; with the goal of elminating all rival priests.  This role is only available in 3 and 4 player games.  If a player chooses this path, then another single player may consecrate themselves to &quot;Lasa Vecuvia&quot; with a different set of powers.  This player's goal is to now move their priests to set &quot;passages&quot; on the path and place 4 seals to win the game.  This role is only available in 4 player games.&#10;&#10;Players win by having the most priests in the center altar at game end.  If a player chooses Tuchulcha's power, they win by eliminating all other priests, and lose if any priest enters the altar.  A player that chooses the Lasa Vecuvia power wins only by placing all 4 seals.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;&#10;Game plays with 2, 3, or 4 players. Each player begins the game with 8 pawns on their home temple.  On their turn players roll 2 dice.  If doubles are rolled, the player may throw a third die.  Then player chooses to move one or more of their pawns the number of pips shown on each die.  For example, if a 5 and a 2 are rolled, a player may move one pawn 5 and another 2, or one pawn 5, and then 2 [not seven at once].  This is important as where you land can be significant on each move.  Players move their pawns around a spiral path approaching the altar at the center.  Along the way players will encounter other players' pawns, and special spaces on the path.  These spaces can increase the &quot;spiritual strength&quot; of players' pieces by two times of three times [Mystical Stones], or &quot;passage&quot; spaces can banish them to the Tuchulcha forest.  While Mystical Stone spaces are powerful in defense, pawns must move off these spaces as soon as they can.  Pawns can normally pass through each other regardless of owner.  Any number of a single player's pawns may occupy a single space.  However, when a pawn would land on another player's by exact count, it must equal the &quot;spiritual strength&quot; of the player's pieces in the space.  Normally, spiritual strenght is one per pawn, but in the 2x or 3x spaces these are multiplied respectively.  If a moving player can eqaul the spiritual strength of pawns in the space, then the occupying pawns are banished to the Tuchulcha forest.  These pawns are essentially out of the game, but can be used to activate the alternate &quot;Tuchulcha&quot; player role. Once a pawn banishes an opponent's pawn, it may not move again this turn.  2 player game uses 2 &quot;neutral&quot; colors which any player can move during their turn.  3 player game adds the optional Tuchulcha player role, and 4 player adds both Tuchulcha and Lasa Vecuvia roles to play.&#10;&#10;At any time one and only one player [in 3 and 4 player games], may choose to take on the role of Tuchulcha [a god of destruction]. To activate this power, the player must &quot;sacrifice&quot; 3 pawns.  These pawns may come from the home temple, altar, path, or Tuchulcha forest.  Once activated, the Tuchulcha player's new objective is to eliminate all other players' pawns.  As soon as one other player's pawn enters the altar, Tuchulcha loses and is eliminated from the game.  This can make this role selection a risky move.  However, this player gains powerful new abilities. Tuchulcha's pawns can never be banished to the forest, he rolls 4 dice and selects the 3 best, and no longer has to stop after banishing an opponent's pawn.&#10;&#10;If a player chooses to be Tuchulcha in a 4 player game, then another [and only one] player may take the role of Lasa Vecuvia.  This player must still have 4 active pawns in play to activate.  This player's objectives are now to &quot;seal&quot; the 4 passages along the path.  These passages normally banish pawns to the forest, but when the Lasa player lands a pawn on the passage, she places a seal token on the passage and removes the pawn from play.  Once she places all four seals in this manner she wins the game.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;32 high quality wooden pawns in 4 colors&#10;4 green wooden dice with gold pips and rounded corners&#10;1 double sided game board for 3 and 4 player games&#10;1 full color illustrated rules booklet&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "This is Hungarian version of the monopoly game that, like Parker Brothers', must have been issued around 1935, because the currency Peng&otilde; was in use in Hungary from 1927 till mid 1946. In addition the banknotes have a kind of &quot;engines-pattern&quot; that resembles that of Parker Brothers' but with 2 engines and 2 houses left and right from the circle-with-number-in-the-center. Everything indicates an imitation rather than a license of Parker Brothers.&#10;&#10;The lid of the box shows a slightly reduced copy of the oblong game board in the colors red, beige and black.&#10;The long sides always have 12 fields between the corners whereas the short ones have 7 spaces. Therefore the streets of the 3rd and 7th group are on 2 sides of the board. The first group is made up of districts of PEST, those of the 5th group of districts of BUDA, whereas all other spaces are streets of BUDAPEST. The back side of the pretty beige colored property deeds is unprinted.&#10;&#10;The streets have no prices on the game board, and the groups are marked by stripes, triangles, crosses and circles. There are but 3 stations which in addition are not situated in the middle of the sides. On the other hand there are also 3 public works, viz. besides the Electric- and Gas Works there is Telephone as well. There are 3 tax spaces. Really Hungarian is the reward of 500 P you get from each player on your name day (N&eacute;vnap).&#10;&#10;The lid and the board's midfield shows an illustration of the New York skyline with the remark &quot;statutory protected&quot;.&#10;&#10;In the center-area is only 1 space for cards being the 24 orange Chance-cards you have to pull arriving on a Wheel of Fortune space. Instead of &quot;Just visiting in Jail&quot; you are going to relax at the Margit Isle (in the middle of the river Donau). You are not sent to this place in the 3rd corner because there you'll join in a lottery. There you have to throw immediately once more. You'll receive 10-fold in Peng&ocirc;s from the bank the number of pips thrown. Should you throw 12 you even get the first prize of 10,000 Peng&ocirc;s. Instead of Free Parking you'll land in the Sanatorium. You may be sent to it as well by a Chance card, because &quot;You are exhausted, you have to be treated - Go to the Sanatorium!&quot;. It is a kind of jail anyhow, because here again you have to omit 3 turns.&#10;&#10;In the inner box is an insert of black plastic containing 5 trays for the equipment. The 7 are printed in black on colored paper in the denominations 10 - 50 - 100 - 200 - 500 - 1000 and 5000 Peng&ocirc;. The tokens consist of 6 colored round discs of timber. There are 32 beige houses of raw timber and 12 red hotels.  One die is black and one red.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Dream Heist is a board game that takes place in the dream world. The board represents the inside of a dreamer's mind, who is known as the Mark. Each player is trying to plant an idea in the Mark's dream, hoping that when he wakes, he will carry out their chosen task. The key is to make your task seem achievable to the Mark and to make sure he believes it was his own idea from its inception. In order to do this the dream needs to be so real, that when the Mark wakes up, the planted idea sticks and he performs the mission without a second thought.&#10;&#10;Each player starts the game with his or her own mission. This is the core idea that they are trying to plant inside the Mark's mind before the dream ends. Each mission is comprised of four steps: Architect, Forger, Extractor, and Inception. Players must collect the correct number of cards for each of these four steps in order to plant their idea fully. This is done by circling the different dream levels in the direction of your choice. There are spaces for collecting cards and planting ideas. Once an idea is planted in a certain section of the Mark's mind, that section is full. The other players must move to another dream level where the section in need is still available. There are also spaces where players encounter the Mark&rsquo;s subconscious, which can either help or hurt you.&#10;&#10;As you move down the dream levels to plant the different phases of your idea, you gain more points. However, it takes more time the further down the levels you go, so you have to plan your route wisely. Ultimately, the Mark will only carry out one player's planted idea when he wakes. This player receives extra points and increases his or her chances for victory.&#10;&#10;",

How much pizza will you have left after completing the four tasks?&#10;&#10;This is a cooperative game - players must work together as a team to succeed.

The advanced tasks provide challenge and replayability for avid gamers. Families playing with kids can enjoy the game even without the advanced tasks.&#10;&#10;Players get points for collecting different combinations of robots. But because this is a cooperative game, you cannot only think about your own points. You must also think about how your card selection affects players downstream from you. Selecting a specific card might help you a little, but it might help a player one or two positions to your left even more. But then again, you aren&rsquo;t entirely sure what players downstream from you are collecting, and they can't tell you. You have to make an educated guess!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The objective is to destroy the enemy headquarters (HQ).  To go on the offensive, deployed units have to be ordered with maneuver cards, which direct the attack along one of three terrain cards between the players.  The defender can freely choose among his deployed units to meet the attackers on that terrain.  The outcome of the resultant combat depends on the influence of the terrain card, the involved units and their attached equipment.  If the attack is not defended against, the attackers inflict damage on the HQ.&#10;&#10;The game ends in a victory to the attacker when he or she has inflicted enough damage (typically 20) to their enemy's HQ.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "With Monopoly Empire, you can own some of the biggest brands in the world as every space on the game board is an iconic brand, including Xbox, Coca-Cola, McDonald's and Samsung.&#10;&#10;As in the original Monopoly game, players start with cash in hand, roll dice, and move a token around the game board while hoping to purchase properties. Each property is represented by one or more billboards, with the more valuable properties having larger billboards. When you purchase a property, you place a billboard into your personal plastic tower; when you pass &quot;Go!&quot; on the game board, you earn income based on the height of your tower. Reach a value of $800 on your tower, and you win.&#10;&#10;When you land on an opponent's property, you pay rent to that player based on the height of her tower. If you don't have enough cash on hand, hand over the top billboard in your tower instead but keep the cash you do have. This mechanism means there is no player elimination.&#10;&#10;While players don't trade properties, you can effectively steal them through the use of Empire cards and the &quot;swap&quot; face on one die, which allows you to swap the top billboards on two towers.&#10;&#10;To date, two editions have been released in the U.S.: The Second &quot;Silver&quot; Edition has some updated properties &amp; movers from the First &quot;Gold&quot; Edition, but gameplay is the same for both editions.&#10;&#10;This game and Monopoly: Here & Now World Edition share many similarities.&#10;&#10;",

It includes 36 cards, 1 to 7, draw 2, all in colors of Red, Blue, Green, and Yellow, and four wild cards. Game play is similar to ordinary Uno. The deck is shuffled and each player is dealt a hand of five cards. Players take turns discarding cards by matching the most recent discard in color or number. This version includes different characters for each number so that characters could also be matched. A player with one card remaining must yell Uno or draw two cards. Players without a matching card must draw one card from the draw stack. If the drawn card matches, it may be played immediately, otherwise the player's turn ends. The two special cards are the wild which permit a player to name a color for the next card to be played and the draw two which forces the next player to pick up two cards and lose their turn. The goal is to be the first player to discard all the cards in their hand.&#10;&#10;---&#10;&#10;All My First UNO games are grouped together in the database because there is seemingly no difference among them other than the featured characters.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "While marketed as a board game, the Magic Robot Quiz game is probably more accurately a &quot;curiosity&quot; game. The &quot;game&quot; consists of placing a little robot figurine which holds a pointer in the center of a circular pattern of questions. The robot is rotated to a particular question, and then lifted from the question area and placed in the center of the circular pattern of answers, whereupon the figurine auto-rotates to point to the correct answer.&#10;&#10;The mechanics of the board simply consist of a magnet in the figurine and two magnets in the board. The question area sets the correct offset on the robot's magnet, and then the robot is allowed to freely rotate in the answer area to provide the corresponding alignment.&#10;&#10;The game is essentially a trivial pursuit limited to eight sets of 14 questions with a &quot;wow&quot; factor for kids.&#10;&#10;Merit also released a &quot;World of Sport&quot; version of the game which used an Olympic torchbearer to point to the right answer.&#10;&#10;Magic Robot Contents:&#10;&#10;1 board&#10;1 Robot figurine&#10;4 overlay mats with questions and answers&#10;&#10;",

Any dice added to the tray must match by colour, number or letters. The first player to get rid of her dice is the winner.&#10;&#10;Game 2&#10;&#10;Game 2 is a variant of Yacht where the object is to have the highest points score after 11 rounds of play. The player draws five dice out of the bag and rolls all of them. The player may then take up to two more rolls with their choice of one or more of these five dice. Simply put aside the dice you do not want to roll, and roll the rest. Any of these dice may be rolled in any of your three rolls, except that all five must be rolled on the first roll. At the end of your turn, you must score your exposed dice faces in one of the eleven spaces in your column of the scoring sheet. If you cannot or do not wish to enter a score in any of the eleven spaces, then you must score a zero in your choice of one of the eleven spaces.&#10;&#10;Game 3&#10;&#10;All 24 spaces in the dice tray are used for Game 3. A player draws one die out of the bag, rolls it, and places it face up in any one of the 24 dice spaces in the tray. After the starting die is placed in the tray, the player to the left of the starting player draws four dice out of the bag and rolls them. The player looks at the dice to see if any of these can match the die already in the tray. The dice can match by either number, color or letter in any combination. If a match can be made, the player places the die in the tray and scores points. Dice are scored by making strings of two or more adjacent dice, all of the same color or kind. All numbered faces (0 through 9) score as their numerical value. The R, S and D2 each score as 20 points. The W and WD4 are not scored.&#10;&#10;After a player finishes their turn, the next player takes a turn using the same dice. Thus a player will usually begin her turn with one less die than the previous player. In this way, the first player will have four dice to roll, the second three, the third will have two, and so on. When a player, down to only one die, is able to play it, then the next player starts the pattern over again by drawing four fresh dice from the bag, rolls them and play proceeds from there.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the dice tray is full. The winner is the player with the highest total score.&#10;&#10;",

A game with very few rules, one that would be very simple to learn and play.&#10;&#10;3. A game that could be played with a high degree of skill.&#10;&#10;4. A game that would not be determinate. A determinate game such as nim or noughts and crosses, is one in which the starting player could always win if he knew the strategy. An indeterminate game is one which two perfect players would play forever.&#10;&#10;The L game was the result. Each player has only one piece.

    "description": "UWO's (unidentified walking objects) are residents of the planet Znorf. There are two kinds of UWO; The Gnorfs and the Pnorfs. Both of them are able to morf. But that is something that will be explained later on. The Gnorfs think that the Pnorfs are a group of ugly creatures and that feeling is completely mutual. All the more reason for them to start a war!&#10;&#10;beginning of the game&#10;UWO is a cardgame and a boardgame at the same time. Both players have six energy cards. The playing field is formed by the energy cards of both players. One player places them horizontally, directly in front of him. The other player does this at the side vertically, just like on the photo. The playing field is between these energy cards. &#10;Both players place their ten 'regular' UWO's of their own color in front of them in two rows of five each. The players shuffle their pack of cards and place them both upside down in front of them.&#10;&#10;energy&#10;Just like life on our planet, life on Znorf is expensive too. Everything you do will cost you &quot;Energy&quot;. you have to pay it for morfing, walking or fighting. Strong UWO's use much energy. If both players used all of their six energy, then a round is over. Everyone gets back his energy. But beware! If you're out of energy and your opponent isn't yet, he will play several turns at once! And for your opponent, weak (and cheap) UWO's come in handy now. They can do a lot of damage to you!&#10;&#10;many different UWO's&#10;There are no less than eight different UWO's in the game. Some are riding Knorfs (strange animails). They can trample everyone. Others are cowards, hiding in bunkers, etc.&#10;UWO's carry many different weapons. Lasers, dynamite, granades, bazooka's, etc. The bazooka UWO for instance, is one of the coolest of the gang and he himself thinks so too. He is extremely powerful. He can even blow up tanks! Unfortunately, such a bazooka is a great danger to our tiny UWO. Each time he has shot someone, he will be knocked out until the end of your next turn!&#10;UWO's are specialists. Every UWO has protection against a specific other UWO. For instance, a UWO in a tank has protection against one who fights with his bare hands.&#10;&#10;dynamite UWO&#10;Well, let's just say there's only one of it on each side. One who can be quite important to both players...&#10;&#10;morfing&#10;UWO's can morf in exchange for one energy point: UWO cards may be placed on UWO's that are already in the game. This way, a regular UWO can be morfed into anything you want to, just like that! This can be very useful. Imagine a laser UWO threatening you. Your opponent announces that it's going to attack!! Don't panic, his UWO can never hit you when you are hiding in a bunker! So, when you have this card, just morf your furry alien into one and shoot back...and hope your opponent doesn't morf his UWO into a grenade UWO...&#10;&#10;the pack of cards&#10;At the end of each turn each player may refill his/her cards to 3. But beware, players can run out of cards. The game still goes on untill all UWO's of one player in the battlefield are destroyed. It is very easy for an opponent to adapt his army to yours, when you are not able to morf anymore! Imagine your opponent creating a small army of laser UWO's to attack your last bazooka UWO! They have protection against this weapon. You may panic now, cause your lost.&#10;In the pack of cards, there are also nine &quot;miss cards.&quot; When you play this card, the shot will automatically be declared &quot;missed&quot; and of course you will have the chance to shoot back with this UWO. But don't play these cards to fast! Smart opponents remember how many you have left. When you lost them all, your opponent knows that every shot will be a hit. Sometimes it's smarter to just sacrifice a UWO, than to play a miss card.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Have you ever played a Fantasy game, killing hordes of useless and stupid Goblins? Prepare to find yourself on the other side of the barricade&hellip; Waves on waves of Goblins try to conquer the city of the humans, through debatable strategies, inconsistent plains and brainless &quot;Epic Death&quot;.&#10;&#10;Goblins is a not collectible card game that melds the bases of the board game with those of the card game.&#10;&#10;Raze the town to the ground and loot everything you can find on your way to leading a mob of stupid Goblins! Other Goblin commanders will collaborate on this task as well. Unfortunately, the idea of collaboration among Goblins is a little bit ambiguous. Dealing with useless subordinates and treacherous allies, the enemy will be the last of your problems.&#10;&#10;Players must destroy the Town and conquer as many Land Cards as possible. Land Cards will award the owner Victory Points. The player with the highest amount of Victory Points wins the match.&#10;&#10;To reach their objective players can rely on Goblin commanders, the alter ego of each player on the battleground; each of these has unique and particular ability to make every game different from the other.&#10;&#10;Unlikely Machines, fearless Goblin heroes and a lot of Action Card make the game always unpredictable.&#10;&#10;The innovative game system is based on &quot; Goblins flipping&quot;. Every choice you make will cause Goblin flip to determine its life or its death. Every Goblin is represented by a disk with two faces: every disk shows a Goblin face on a side and a Goblin skull on the other side.&#10;&#10;The game is exciting every moment also when it isn&rsquo;t your turn. No player will ever be too strong or too weak and the game strategy will change turn after turn suiting better possible the situation.&#10;&#10;Through the system of the exhilarating &quot;Epic Deaths &quot;, your Goblins can commit mass suicide in eccentric ways. The &ldquo;Epic Death&rdquo; can confuse every enemy and allows you to beat him for the dismay. No player is ever out of the game.&#10;&#10;Let the fight for stupidity begin!&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Badaboom is a humorous card game for 3-5 players. The 30-60 minutes of game play feature loads of explosive action, a high level of player interaction, a non-sequential order of play, fabulous contraptions, numerous chances to stick it to your opponents in nasty ways and stunning graphics from the artists behind Spank the Monkey and Kablamo. The game contains 64 cards, 50 Gold Coin markers, 2 Bomb Armed markers and a rules folder.&#10;&#10;The players of Badaboom take on the roles of wretched goblins in penal servitude under the cruel High Necromancer. Their task is to sit in an explosive-proof dungeon and try reverse engineering, tinkering style, on various explosive contraptions manufactured by their master&rsquo;s enemies. But the task to gain hands-on personal knowledge about what makes the devices go off and what damage they can do is no picnic, and not even a lifetime supply of resurrections can change that. The goblins want out, and the only way to succeed with this is to earn the gold coins needed for bribing their greedy guards.&#10;&#10;The fundamentals of Badaboom are quite simple, but there are lots of tricks and tactics that add depth. Basically, the players take turns holding and tinkering with the bomb while striving to do three things:&#10;&bull; Remove valuable mechanisms from the bomb.&#10;&bull; Change the nature of the bomb in a way that is favorable to the current player but not necessarily to the others.&#10;&bull; Make damn sure to stay away from the explosion when the bomb goes off.&#10;&#10;This may sound straightforward, but things are made complicated by the fact that any player can steal the bomb during other players&rsquo; turns. And it&rsquo;s very tempting to steal it. Not only do players get to tinker with the bomb when holding it. They may also draw a card from the deck, and as the deck is placed face up revealing the next card, the players know what they can gain by stealing the bomb. This makes the bomb skip and turn a lot during the game, keeping all players on their toes.&#10;&#10;To win, players need to perfect their timing, make every card count and, of course, avoid losing their heads.&#10;&#10;Reimplemented by&#10;&#10;&#10;    Big Badaboom&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The blue and red are numbered 1 to 20 and have arrows, the blue point up, the red point down.&#10;&#10;Players get 7 cards and start playing to a stack, drawing if unable to play. If the top card is blue (UP), you can play a sequence of blue cards going up. If the top card is red, going down. You can play one yellow card of any number, perform the action, but the direction doesn't change. You can only change direction by playing the same number of the other color.&#10;&#10;So if the top card is blue 10, you can play any yellow, or a sequence of blue upwards starting with blue 11 or higher, or a sequence of red downwards starting with red 10 only. You can play yellow cards inside the sequence, but a final yellow has the action as well.&#10;&#10;When someone clears their hand, they get +5 points and you lose a point for each card you hold.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "A bagatelle board resembles a light, flat board with nails (pins!) in it and short raised sides to keep the ball on the playfield during play.  Each ball is launched from some sort of spring-loaded 'shooter' or cue, to the top of the board, where it then rolls towards the player, bouncing off the pins or landing in any of several scoring pockets.  These scoring pockets can be depressions in the playfield, nails arranged in a U-shape, or both.  They are marked with various score values, with the higher values usually protected by more pins or tougher paths to reach them.  By &quot;shooting&quot; the ball harder or softer, the player can try to control where the ball drops.&#10;&#10;A spring-loaded shooter is normally in the bottom right corner of the board. A ball is placed before the shooter mechanism. The shooter devise is pulled back and let go, with the aim to fire the ball up to the rounded end of the board and then to bounce around the nails or pins and, hopefully, land in a scoring area. A cue shooter is just a wooden object, rather like a miniature version of a Billiards cue. To launch a ball, the player merely shoots it by hitting the back of the ball with the cue thus sending it to the top of the board.&#10;&#10;Note that it is possible for a ball not to score at all. This usually means that the ball reached the bottom of the board without settling into a scoring pocket.&#10;&#10;Typically, a player might get 3 or more balls and a note of the total score achieved is taken. The first to reach a pre-agreed number of points, wins.&#10;&#10;Bagatelle sets can be made of wood, metal or plastic and they can be of any size (but it must be able to stand on an average table). They are often linked to a theme, really as an excuse to feature related graphics. The game is a direct ancestor of modern Pinball machines.&#10;&#10;",

Blank dice return to the roller's Start section.  If the player rolls &quot;Sorry&quot; on the Sorry die, they steal a die from someone else's Home and put it in their own Start.

The game can be played by two players or two teams. To start, a team rolls the die. A 1, 2, or 3 lets them know how many scorecard spaces they can fill in if they arrive at the correct verdict. After reading a case, they deliberate, debate, and finally decide for or against the plaintiff. A correct verdict advances the team. An incorrect verdict leaves them cooling their heels. The first team to arrive at the finish line wins. Sometimes being judgmental feels good. --Wendy Slotboom&#10;&#10;",

Players can up the level of gaming complexity in the &quot;Intermediate Game&quot; by adding the two &quot;Casting Cards&quot; into game play. These are included with the Starter Set and enhance the effect of Spells, Potions and Charms. The &quot;Advanced Game&quot; adds more options and strategies to game play, yet requires separate purchases of additional Casting Stones and Casting Cards sold in &quot;Refill Sets.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Little Red vs. Pinocchio is the second game in the Scary Tales series of two-player games pitting common fairy tale characters against each other. Here's more about the two characters in this game from the publisher:&#10;&#10;&quot;Little Red is a scorned girl on a mission to prove that you may be able to fool her once, but you can't fool her twice! Pinocchio is a fibbing, scheming puppet that won't let you pull his strings. They both want to rule over the land, and they've got the drive to win. With the help of their companions, the Woodsman and the Cricket, each of them will be tough to beat.&quot;&#10;&#10;The setting for Scary Tales is a kingdom, where a battle awaits as the king has died, leaving no heir. While the enchanted forest is feared and the castle is covered in dark clouds, corruption has affected the town and only those with the utmost abilities in Strength, Wisdom, Magic and Luck will be able to collect enough relics from the stories of long ago to prove themselves worthy of being the new leader. The challengers are sharp, indomitable, and devious - and with each match-up, it is uncertain who will win the crown.&#10;&#10;Each character comes with its own unique ability which may be used once per game and a color coded set of dice. A set of power cards and fortune cards, a fairy card and a die associated with said fairy comprise the contents of the game. To win, a player needs to obtain seven points worth of relics, and hold on to them until the beginning of their next turn.&#10;&#10;",
