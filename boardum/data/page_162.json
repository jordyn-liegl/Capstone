    "description": "&quot;Blenheim 1704 AD&quot; is a tactical wargame from &quot;Turning Point Simulations&quot; which focuses on the battlefield area itself, with each side having two distinct commands and forces. Players will command the varied forces of each side, with British, Dutch, Austrians, Prussians, Danes, and various German allies on one side and French, Bavarians, and even Irish fighting for Louis. Each unit in the game represents one brigade with each combat strength point around 400 men or 200 horses. One hex on the map equals 400 meters. A turn represents around one hour of action and the game can last up to 7 turns.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;But &lsquo;twas a famous victory!&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Many wars have been fought to tip or maintain that illusive &ldquo;balance of power&rdquo; between nations, while including other objectives. The War of Spanish Succession might be the poster child for &ldquo;balance&rdquo; efforts, as demonstrated by the British&hellip; who allied with the Hapsburgs to stop a union between France and Spain&hellip;then left the war when it looked like the Hapsburgs could win (since Britain also feared a union of Spain and Austria!). Over the course of a 12-year war, there was much coming and going (along with secret negotiations and betrayals). The war included battlefields as far apart as Quebec and the Papal States, from the Netherlands to Hungary, and to various spots all over the German states. Including a small village on the Danube named Blindheim&hellip; which the British would garble as &ldquo;Blenheim.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Up to that point, things had been going well for the French and their armies looked to capture Vienna and take the Habsburgs out of the equation. Marlborough changed all that, but only after lying to his Dutch allies and virtually &ldquo;stealing&rdquo; the army he marched 250 miles away from the Low Countries he was expected to protect. After days of marching, countermarching, probes and parrying, the Allies attacked a foe of slightly larger size and in good positions, while the French were expecting them to retreat.  Their cavalry was somewhat dispersed and too much of their infantry was in the towns of the area.  And, up to that point, the French Army was considered &ldquo;unbeatable.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;The battle went back and forth, with each side having opportunities for success but seeing confusion and heavy losses confound good plans.  Certainly Marlborough and Eugene worked together marvelously well, especially for allies, which may have been the key difference. Tallard and Marsin and the Bavarians had their chances but missed them, needing infantry where they had cavalry and cavalry where they had infantry. When the British attacked the &ldquo;seam&rdquo; between the two forces, Marsin&rsquo;s regiments fell back and Tallard&rsquo;s collapsed.  French losses were heavy, and their army&rsquo;s aura of invincibility was gone forever.&#10;&#10;Though the war would continue for over 10 more years, Blenheim rates as &ldquo;decisive&rdquo; because this cost Louis the chance to knock the Habsburgs out of the war early. Instead, it would be his Bavarian allies who would lose out and become vassals to Vienna. In the end, the war would end as countries spun into exhaustion and a number of rulers died from age or sickness, making separate treaties that were finally consolidated under the Treat of Utrecht. France would not dominate the continent and, the most visible effect to us today, Britain still possesses Gibraltar.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "In the trick-taking card game 6th Sense, you score by correctly predicting the number of tricks you'll take in a round.&#10;&#10;The game lasts 4-6 rounds depending on the player count. The deck contains cards numbered 0-14 in five colors, and at the start of a round players are dealt a hand of 11-15 cards, then the top card of the deck is revealed to designate a trump suit. Each player then simultaneously chooses a card from their hand to predict the number of tricks they'll win this round, then places this card face down on the table.&#10;&#10;In general, standard trick-taking rules apply: Someone leads a card, and other players must follow suit, if possible, with the highest trump or highest card of the suit lead winning the trick. That said, some cards have special effects when played:&#10; &#10;    When you play a 0, you can treat it as a 0 of that color, or you can remove the 0 and one previously played card from the current trick.&#10;    A trick with a 4 in it is won by the lowest card played instead of the highest; a second 4 cancels this effect.&#10;    The 6 and 9 are on the same card, and you declare which value you want when playing it (or when using it to predict the number of tricks you'll win).&#10;    When you start a trick with an 8, you can peek at the prediction card of whoever wins that trick.&#10;    If a trick contains at least one 12, the trick's winner can choose to immediately split the cards in that trick to count as two tricks.&#10;&#10;&#10;At the end of the round, if you've collected as many tricks as you predicted at the start of the round, you score that many points. If you failed to collect that number, you lose as many points as the difference between your prediction and what you collected, e.g., if you predicted 5 and collected 4 or 6 tricks, you lose 1 point. After the designated number of rounds, whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

These are claimed by placing a castle and cathedral on the specified area of the map board.&#10;&#10;Play commences with the Administrative Phase where players collect taxes based on the number of territories and cathedrals they control. Following is the Military phase that is divided into three optional steps. The first is to roll 2d6 for a random event that will cause the player to either gain or lose money, lose cards, lose castles or become the pope. The second option is to build new castles on your territories. The final is an attack on another person's territory.&#10;&#10;Territories can attack adjacent territories or those on the same body of water. The attacking and defensive force are determined by the number of castles on each territory. For each castle on his/her territory, the attacker and defenders each roll a die and apply any modifiers obtained by cathedrals or cards in his/her possession. Results of 6 or over destroy a castle of the opposing side. If all of the defenders castles are lost, the attacker wins the territory, places a castle to claim it and may draw a card at the end of the phase. Cards offer various benefits such as money, attack/defence points or game actions.&#10;&#10;Play continues until one player controls 8 cathedrals.&#10;&#10;... and apparently the castles are cute.&#10;&#10;",

Players negotiate trades and use biotic and abiotic factor cards to affect their webs and the webs of players around them. It is a race to get to 12 victory points, with players using different strategies such as focusing on one biome, going for perks and bonuses, or disrupting other ecologies.&#10;&#10;Gameplay is rooted in authentic science, as it is used in the classroom to teach real concepts to biology students. While it is scientific enough for the classroom, it is also strategic enough for any game night.&#10;&#10;The points system is based on ecological trophic levels. The producers (plants) are worth less and as you make your way up the pyramid organisms are worth more, as it takes a lot of energy to sustain them. In real life only roughly 10% of the energy makes it from one level to the next, meaning you have to have acres of land and hundreds of animals just to sustain one apex predator.&#10;&#10;This game is a sequel AND an expansion. When using the game as an expansion, you can customize the deck to include cards from all three games, including cards you love and excluding ones you don&rsquo;t. Some players love aggressive &ldquo;take that&rdquo; mechanics, while others find them stressful. Some players love particular healthy ecology bonuses, while others feel they are overpowered. With multiple decks, you can create a customized experience to fit your group.&#10;&#10;If you&rsquo;d like to maintain the same game length and feel, we recommend choosing 10 factor cards and 7 different biomes.&#10;&#10;Note: more cards = a longer game&#10;&#10;-description from publisher's website&#10;&#10;",

The farmers cherish  their own dear little pet bunnies, but they are furious when other farmers' bunnies come to eat all the carrots they have grown.&#10;Now, the farmers have had enough of it, and have decided to seize all the others' rabbits! But considering that every one of them wants to hide away his own bunnies, will it be that simple to catch others' bunnies? Your goal in this game is to hide away your own bunnies from the other players, and to hunt out the other players' rabbits.&#10;&#10;This is a tile placement game with an interesting theme from a Chinese idiom - A cunning rabbit has three warrens. In this game you need to hide your rabbit cards into the farmyard and find out other players' rabbits. However, every turn you need to place a card to the farmyard. Then you can execute two actions. If you use too much actions to trace rabbits, your hand will reduce quickly, but catch others' rabbits is the only way to win.&#10;&#10;Home Page: http://embedded.cs.ccu.edu.tw/~mellow/rabbithunt/&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "From the MicroDesign Group Website.&#10;&#10;THE GREAT IDEA&#10;&#10;World War I (1914-1918) left both Greece and T&uuml;rkey near ruin. By 1920, Greece was emerging from what amounted to a civil war between supporters and opponents of the visionary but reckless prime minister, Elefth&eacute;rios Veniz&eacute;los. T&uuml;rkey's civil war was still in progress, fought between the last, heartbroken Ottoman Sultan and the dynamic new insurgent, Mustapha Kemal (later called Atat&uuml;rk).&#10;&#10;Each side in the wider struggle pursued its own vision of national rebirth. For Veniz&eacute;los and Greece the dream was called &quot;The Great Idea&quot; and promised the renaissance of Greece as a great power through a restoration of the Byzantine Empire, the reconquest of Constantinople (lost to the T&uuml;rks in 1453) and the reunion of all ethnic Greeks under the rule of Athens. For Kemal's T&uuml;rks, their own &quot;great idea&quot; was the forging of a new, compact T&uuml;rkish Republic united not by the outdated creed of Islam but by a new T&uuml;rkish nationalism, modernized and empowered by Western culture and commerce.&#10;&#10;These two visions of national rebirth fought bitterly over the plains, deserts, and mountains of Anatolia for three long years. Western Anatolia was ethnically mixed, and neither side had an exclusive claim. The great prize was Smyrna, taken by Greece in 1919: a city which was home to more Greeks than Athens itself. The war had profound implications for the entire region. Greek victory would cement Greece as a regional power, and act as a beacon of hope to Orthodox Russians seeking to topple Lenin's Communists in the ongoing Russian Civil War. T&uuml;rkish defeat would mean the collapse of Kemal's vision of a secular, democratic T&uuml;rkey and would block the spread of Western values in the Near East, leaving T&uuml;rkey battered and backward, and the rest of the Moslem world feeling victimized and enraged.&#10;&#10;As it happened, T&uuml;rkey won and Greece lost. Kemal's vision prevailed; T&uuml;rkey emerged victorious, united and profoundly westernized. Women gave up the veil and went to school. The Roman alphabet replaced the Arabic, and Islam was evicted from politics. For the Greeks, the end came in September of 1922 when the T&uuml;rks captured Smyrna and burned the city to the ground. A million and a half Greeks fled or were expelled, and nearly 2,900 years of Hellenic civilization in Asia came to an abrupt and humiliating end. Greece, overwhelmed by refugees, collapsed into a series of coups and revolutions punctuated by all sorts of autocracy and spectacular misrule, from which, arguably, it has only recently recovered.&#10;&#10;Whose &quot;great idea&quot; will shape the modern Near East? Now you can make the decision by playing Byzantium Reborn!&#10;&#10;Byzantium Reborn is a simulation game on the Greek-T&uuml;rkish War of 1920-22. The game is for two players, one representing the Kingdom of Greece and its allies (the Greek player), and the other the insurgent nationalist forces of Mustapha Kemal who opposed the Greek invasion (the T&uuml;rkish player). The 11 x 17&quot; map of Anatolia (Asia Minor) depicts the areas where the war took place. The scale is about 40 miles to the inch. The 280 counters represent the military formations including Turks, Greeks, French, Italians and many others.&#10;&#10;",

Like life, it starts simply, and then becomes challenging as you develop skills.&#10;&#10;Setup: Place the hexagonal bases in any layout.  This is entirely up to the players, and can drastically change the game play, offering a lot of replay options.  Place a number of cards face down randomly, again adding to replay.  Deal each player 5 cards and choose your side (green or purple).&#10;&#10;Play: Players alternate turns placing the triangular cards into the slots on the hexagonal bases.  Based on how you place a card, you may flip face down cards.  The goal is to score points while maintaining balance between man and nature (purple and green).  Points are earned when a base is full, but can be lost as more cards are played on that base.  If your color has the most cards on a base, you gain 2 points for that area.  If the total of the numbers on the cards in an area is positive, purple gets a point.  If negative total, green gets a point.  These points overlap with most cards of a color points, so keeping track of the points is important.  The first player to 4 points wins.  However, you are both playing with the same deck, and cards of each color, so it's not as simple as it may seem.  You can raise or lower your opponent's total on an area, and if the total is +-7 or more, the corresponding color cards are all removed and play continues with what remains.&#10;&#10;",

Turenne operated in the northeast of France to join the troops of the Duc de Lorraine and the Spanish with hopes of regaining control of all the fortresses acquired in Cond&eacute;&rsquo;s cause.&#10;Sensing the danger of having such a great captain against him, Mazarin entrusted the command of the armies of Flanders and Champagne to the Comte de Plessis-Praslin (meanwhile beginning secret negotiations with the other camp). Plessis-Praslin lay siege to Rethel and, despite having given his word, the governor of Rethel surrendered a few days before Turenne&rsquo;s arrival. The commander of the Frondeur army was therefore required to combat the entire Royalist army.&#10;After his defeat (which would be the last one), Turenne joined the king&rsquo;s camp in exchange for amnesty, a few titles and, most importantly, the command of the French armies. He would be a loyal servant of the king until his death on the battlefield 25 years later.&#10;&#10;&bull; The Dunes 1658 &ndash; 14 June 1658, The alliances had evolved since the end of the Thirty Years&rsquo; War. The Lorraine soldiers had gone over to the French camp after their duke was imprisoned by the Spanish. Mazarin convinced King Louis XIV to sign a military alliance with Cromwell who sent a strong English contingency to the continent, thereby forcing King Charles II and Princes James and Henry to join the Spanish with their meagre troops. Exiled with those loyal to him for nearly six years, Cond&eacute; was also on the side of Juan of Austria, the commander in chief of the Spanish forces.&#10;When Turenne lay siege to the fortress of Dunkirk, Juan of Austria decided to give battle right away. Cond&eacute; declared to James &ldquo;Sir, today you will see how to lose a battle&rdquo;.&#10;As a result of this French victory, the Treaty of the Pyrenees and other related agreements were signed, putting an end to the Franco-Spanish War, to some extent the Fronde, and the English Civil War . The sun of Louis XIV could begin to shine.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;Avec Honneur et Panache: Volume 1 - Turenne c'est un jeu d'histoire couvrant 2 batailles men&eacute;es par Turenne : Rethel 1650 et Les Dunes 1658.&#10;Syst&egrave;me de jeu d&eacute;riv&eacute; de Paris vaut bien une Messe!, utilis&eacute; &eacute;galement par Series: Avec Infini Regret (Vae Victis).&#10;&#10;&bull; Rethel 1650 &ndash; 15 d&eacute;cembre 1650, Le Prince de Cond&eacute; ayant &eacute;t&eacute; emprisonn&eacute; par Mazarin au d&eacute;but de l&rsquo;ann&eacute;e par peur de son influence grandissante, les troupes clientes du Prince se rallient &agrave; Turenne pass&eacute; depuis peu dans le camp de la Fronde.

It was also a time of expansion for the Manchu Empire, which could have put China on a collision course with the Europeans. Historically, the Seven Years War resulted in the domination of central Europe by Prussia and of North America and India by Great Britain.&#10;&#10;Seven Years World War can be played by two, three, or four, each representing a different coalition of powers. Each player has a variety of military, diplomatic and economic instruments with which he can attempt to dominate the world.&#10;&#10;The Major Powers includes: Austrian Empire, France, Great Britain, Maratha Confederation (India), Manchu Empire (China), Ottoman Empire, Prussia, Russian Empire, Spanish Empire, and United Provinces (Netherlands).&#10;&#10;The game map shows the world as it was during the mid-18th century. A square grid has been superimposed on the map to regularize the position and movement of the playing pieces.  Players should note the actual geographic boundaries of the various empires and powers are slightly distorted to clarify their position on the map.&#10;&#10;The game is won by gaining control of strategic objectives that can then be translated into success at the peace table.&#10;&#10;",

Each player has a deck of cards showing the same people, in different poses. The cabin cards are shuffled and laid out face-down in two columns of 5, with a gap and a pawn is placed next to the gap. First player to grab the die rolls it and moves the pawn clockwise to face a cabin. Players call out which person they think is in the cabin and the cabin card is turned up. If you're correct, you dump the matching card from your hand; if not, you keep it. But the cabin card is replaced face-down in the original empty space, not where it was previously. In this way, the cabin cards will be moved around as you play, and you'll have to use your memory to clear your hand to win.&#10;&#10;There are also tempo chips you can draw for correctly guessing a card you've already dumped. You can use the chips to move the pawn fore or back from the numbered rolled (so it goes to a cabin you remember and want to dump).

Turn order consists of 1. Knitting (advancing time card) 2. Drawing Yarn Cards from the Yarn Store or Choosing additional Pattern Cards 3. Casting-On (only one pattern per turn) 4. Restock the Yarn Store. *Community Cards cost 5 Yarn Cards and can be bought or spent at any time during a players turn. The Community deck is filled with action cards and secret points.&#10;&#10;Pattern cards have both yarn and time requirements. Collect Yarn Cards from the Yarn Store and when you have the right yarn for a pattern, 'Cast-On' by placing the Pattern Card and required Yarn Card(s) on the table along with the Cast-On (time) Card. Each round thereafter advances your project by one week. When the time requirement is met, discard the yarn cards and move the pattern card to the 'Blocking Mat' as a way to keep track of your FO (finished object) points. Each player starts with 4 Cast-On cards and can have up to 4 active projects in-progress at any given time.&#10;&#10;No previous knitting knowledge required to play. But if you are a knitter you can play this with your non-knitter friends and family to give them a peek into your fiber-y world or play with other knitters and meta game while knitting on matching patterns irl to earn extra points.&#10;&#10;",

Only a tenacious German defense-in-depth and an equally devastating counterattack employing the new, then-secret infiltration tactics, prevented the British from making a decisive breakthrough.  Despite this setback, Cambrai was the forerunner of the mobile warfare of the Second World War.&#10;&#10;Now, THE FIRST BLITZKRIEG: CAMBRAI, 1917 allows you to recreate this battle, one of the most significant in military history.  Two players, each taking on the role of one of the historical commanders, use the Mapboard, 72 unit counters, and complete rules of play, to either change or recreate the historical results.&quot;&#10;&#10;Description of Game Components:&#10;&#10;Game Consist of a two color map, 72 (3/4&quot;) counters and rules of play.  No indication of scale is given in the rules.  Map is 17 hexes from West to East and 16 hexes from North to South.  Cambrai is located in north-east (upper right) corner of map  and the town of Sorel-Le-Grand is located in the south-west (lower left) corner of map.  Game is 17 turns in length.&#10;&#10;Rules are printed on both sides of single 18&quot; x 16&quot; sheet of paper.  Rules include 13 &quot;Variable Historical Options&quot; that can be used singly or in combination to offer a &quot;virtually limitless amount of scenarios.&quot;  Each option changes a historical factor in the game and include: &quot;British Develop Infiltration Tactics&quot;, &quot;General Harper Fragged&quot;, &quot;Improved Tanks&quot;, &quot;Germans Forewarned&quot;, &quot;French Participation&quot;, &quot;Cavalryman's Fantasy&quot; and &quot;Free Setup.&quot;&#10;&#10;Hex Movement system, IGO-UGO sequence of play (with addition of tank attrition phase for British player.&#10;&#10;Combat Results Table is Odds Based and consists of a separate table for each type of attack (Standard, Mobile, Probing or Surprise).  A 3-1 attack on the &quot;Standard Attack&quot; table results in a 33% (1,2) chance of a Defender Eliminated result, a 33% (3,4) chance of a &quot;counterattack&quot; result in which the defender has the chose of retreating 1 hex or counterattacking one of the hexes the attack was launched from, and a 33% (5,6) chance of a an Exchange result.&#10;&#10;From the Game Notes:&#10;&#10;&quot;CAMBRAI, 1917 is a see-saw battle.  The British have the advantage for the first three turns, but then it begins to slip away.  The German commander than has the opportunity to stabilize the situation and seize the initiative with his counterattack.  Therefore, the German should not give up if things look bad after the first few turns.  The situation can change drastically every turn until the end of the game.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

If any player is on the &quot;wake up&quot; tile when all &quot;bad dream&quot; cards are removed, they escape and win the game; if all the characters are immobilized by chains or the event cards are exhausted without anyone waking up, then everyone is defeated.&#10;&#10;In more detail, you and each other player take a character card and cover two of the six spaces on its &quot;chain gauge&quot;. The highest uncovered number on this gauge shows how many action points (AP) you have available on your turn, and each character has a unique skill, in addition to values for strength, wisdom, and luck. All characters start on the central tile, with the &quot;wake up&quot; tile being placed at the bottom of the room tile deck. On a turn, you use your AP to take actions from the following list, repeating actions as desired:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Add a new room tile to the playing area, matching doors and walls on all tiles; draw and resolve an event card, with a &quot;bad dream&quot; being placed on this card.&#10;    Move to an adjacent tile.&#10;    Search a &quot;secret spot&quot; on a tile, drawing an item card if you make a wisdom check.&#10;    Use a consumable (one-time) item card. (Equippable item cards can be used repeatedly and cost 0 AP.)&#10;    Give an item to another character on the same tile as you or on an adjacent tile.&#10;    Give chains to or take chains from another character on the same tile as you or on an adjacent tile.&#10;    Use your personal skill (if it has an AP cost).&#10;&#10;&#10;As chains are added to or removed from your character card, your AP count might change. If all six spaces on your chain gauge are covered, you're immobilized and can spend no AP on your turn. If a &quot;bad dream&quot; is placed in a room, no character can enter that room, although you might be able to remove it through various skills, items, or events; if a &quot;Bad dream&quot; ends up in your room, then you're trapped in that dream and cannot move until you or someone else can dissolve that dream.&#10;&#10;After all players take their actions, the demon acts, initially with only one event card, but as the game progresses and shrieks are added to the table, more event cards are drawn for each demon turn.&#10;&#10;If all the bad dreams have been vanquished and a player is on the &quot;wake up&quot; tile &mdash; which will be drawn only after sixteen room tiles in a game of normal difficulty &mdash; then you all win, with everyone awakening from the demon's clutches.

Swiftly place dice to secure treasure cards. Then replace your dice with action cards to attack the other players. Then collect treasure if your cards survive the attacks.&#10;&#10;The playing area is a grid of treasure cards and a bell in the centre. The bell is rung, and each player rolls and rerolls their own six dice entirely at will, trying to make combos to place on treasure cards. As soon as there are any three pairs in any line, any player may ring the bell to force a stop (and becomes the start player). It helps to secure treasure cards in sections; if you succeed, you collect all treasures you have linked up.&#10;&#10;Each player has nine cards, numbered 0 to 5 (four 5 cards each). Each card attacks neighbouring locations in different directions, except the 0 card which is a shield, and the 5 cards on which you are becalmed. Depending on which locations you grabbed, you take turns placing cards face down, taking back your dice. The actions are revealed and resolved, going from 0 to 5 (tied numbers are won closest to the start player).&#10;&#10;Here the tactical element appears. The cards 1 to 4 attack each other in set patterns, and in rank order from low to high. Since you cannot pick up cards spent in previous rounds until you clear your hand, you must choose carefully which cards you place where. If you think a spot is safe from any attack, you can safely spend a 5 card and help clear your hand.&#10;&#10;If you think a spot is certain to be attacked, place your 0 and it survives. If you have claimed places on straight lines, you'll collect all the empty treasure cards lying between them, so often you want to be secure. If you know what cards the others have spent, you might get your attack in first with a low numbered attack.&#10;&#10;After a couple of rounds, the tactical choices become very clear and frustrating. Using the wrong action cards is a costly waste. Failing to get dice down means you get fewer chances to collect treasure and it takes longer to clear your hand and pick up your discard.&#10;&#10;Once the action cards have been resolved, any left standing take the treasure cards below them or linked in straight lines, and the action cards go to a personal discard face-down. Empty treasure spots are refilled, and the bell is rung! The game ends when there is not enough treasure on the table. At the finish, most treasure cards wins.&#10;&#10;The game is fast and the theme fits the game play. The game is language free. The second edition simply revised the artwork on the box and cards to a more cartoon/manga style and added a strategic variant. Otherwise, components and gameplay are identical between the first and second editions.&#10;&#10;Publisher's summary&#10;Roll the dice to your heart&rsquo;s content! Ring up a storm with the bells! Speed and strategies are both important for this analog game, which offers real-time domination + mind games, appealing to all 5 senses.&#10;&#10;Secure territories pre-emptively by placing a pair of dice on the treasure cards as fast as possible, then take time to think about how to protect the territories with attack cards, so that other players cannot foil your plans.&#10;&#10;If you are successful in holding your territory on the treasure cards, then SUCCESS! The treasure cards are rewarded to you and the process is repeated again. In the end, the player with the most treasure cards wins.&#10;&#10;&#227;&#130;&#181;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#130;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#173;&#230;&#140;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#153;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#233;&#179;&#180;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#10;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#131;&#148;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#229;&#191;&#131;&#231;&#144;&#134;&#230;&#136;&#166;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#228;&#184;&#161;&#230;&#150;&#185;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#228;&#186;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#233;&#153;&#163;&#229;&#143;&#150;&#227;&#130;&#138;&times;&#229;&#191;&#131;&#231;&#144;&#134;&#230;&#136;&#166;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#228;&#186;&#148;&#230;&#132;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#230;&#165;&#189;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#131;&#138;&#227;&#131;&#173;&#227;&#130;&#176;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;&#227;&#129;&#178;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#232;&#168;&#128;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#239;&#188;&#159;&#10;&#10;&#229;&#160;&#180;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#232;&#178;&#161;&#229;&#174;&#157;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#131;&#128;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#151;&#169;&#231;&#189;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#232;&#178;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#232;&#135;&#170;&#229;&#136;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#233;&#153;&#163;&#229;&#156;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#228;&#187;&#174;&#231;&#162;&#186;&#228;&#191;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#190;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#152;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#232;&#128;&#131;&#227;&#129;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#230;&#148;&#187;&#230;&#146;&#131;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#228;&#189;&#191;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#228;&#187;&#150;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#233;&#130;&#170;&#233;&#173;&#148;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#233;&#153;&#163;&#229;&#156;&#176;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#174;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#229;&#174;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#233;&#153;&#163;&#229;&#156;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#232;&#178;&#161;&#229;&#174;&#157;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;GET&#239;&#188;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#230;&#181;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#185;&#176;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#232;&#191;&#148;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;&#230;&#156;&#128;&#231;&#181;&#130;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#232;&#178;&#161;&#229;&#174;&#157;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#231;&#149;&#170;&#229;&#164;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#231;&#141;&#178;&#229;&#190;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#229;&#136;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Sign of the Pagan from Richard Berg portrays the most famous battle of one of history&rsquo;s most feared figures &ndash; Attila the Hun. It is considered by some to be the battle that saved Western Europe from the Huns and, for the most part, put an end to Attila&rsquo;s wide-sweeping drives for loot.&#10;&#10;The Battle of the Catalaunian Fields was fought as the age of the Roman West faded away and the Dark Ages began. As Attila&rsquo;s Huns and their Germanic barbarian allies moved into Western Europe, leaving a trail of pillage and destruction behind and threats of more violence to come, the remnants of the Western Roman Empire joined with their former enemies, the mighty Visigoth tribe, to stop the deadly invasion.&#10;&#10;The two coalitions squared off in battle in the summer of 451 A.D. in what is now central France. The result entered both history and mythic folklore, as one of the last armies of the Roman Empire stood in common cause with their bitter Gothic rivals to defend their lands and their peoples from the marauding terror of the Huns.&#10;&#10;Game Data:&#10;&#10;Complexity: 4 on a 9 scale&#10;Solitaire Suitability: 6 on a 9 scale&#10;&#10;What's In The Box?:&#10;&#10;&bull; One 20-page full color Rules booklet&#10;&bull; Two 11&rdquo; x 17&rdquo; paper game maps&#10;&bull; 96 counters&#10;&bull; 16 Opportunity cards&#10;&bull; One player aid&#10;&bull; One ten-sided die&#10;&bull; One bright red, 9 1/4&quot; x 5 7/8&quot; Standard cardboard VPG game box&#10;&bull; One beautiful box cover sleeve&#10;&bull; One &quot;Wipes-A-Lot&quot; napkin&#10;&bull; One charcoal desiccant packet&#10;&#10;",

Each round, a player rolls the eight colored dice, then players draft one die in turn; you extend the length of your worm by drawing a vertical or horizontal line from your worm's current location that matches the length of the die rolled. Since you are a mindless space worm, you can't cross over your path or else you'll eat your own tail! If you can't move, you cross off one of your hearts.&#10;&#10;If you pass through a fruit after drafting a die of the matching color, you score 1 bonus point. Should you cross out all fruit of one type, you score the highest available bonus for this fruit, lowering that potential bonus for all other players.&#10;&#10;Once a player has eaten out all of the fruit in the solar system or lost their fourth heart, the game ends. Players tally their four fruit scores, earn 2 points for each remaining heart, then lose points based on how many of the eight planets they didn't visit.&#10;&#10;Space Worm includes four different maps featuring wormholes, forcefields, and more, and is the first title in ITB's Lunchbox Series.&#10;&#10;Per ITB:&#10;This game is strictly limited to 1000 copies, and will not be available beyond 31st December 2020.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "La Primogenita is a wargame at Brigade level about the East African Campaign in 1941. It covers the Allied invasion into Italian Eritrea in the north where the most intense fighting took place, especially around the town of Cheren. The Allies invaded Eritrea with two Indian Divisions and some Free French units. The defending Italians consisted mostly of colonial Brigades, recruited among Ethiopians and Eritreans. They also had two metropolitan Divisions in reserve among which several elite battalions from the &rdquo;Grenadiers of Savoy&rdquo; Division were sent north to Eritrea. These battalions (Alpini and Bersaglieri), together with loyal Eritrean colonial troops held both Allied Divisions at bay for eight weeks at Cheren before the survivors were finally forced to retreat towards the Eritrean capital Asmara. The battle of Cheren is seen as an hour of glory in the Italian army. The game introduces a dynamic Order chit system. You decide in advance during each Order Segment a set of Orders, each one with a certain priority value, and so does your opponent. The Priority value decides which Order will be executed. You will have to choose wisely depending on what forces you have at hand, when you wish things to happen, and what you suspect your opponent will choose.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "On November 6th, 1861, rebels in Columbus, Kentucky, celebrated the election of President Jefferson Davis. That same day, General Ulysses S. Grant moved against General Polk on the opposite side of the Mississippi. This was to be Grant's first aggressive action of the war. Grant landed 3,000 men, supported by artillery and cavalry two miles southeast of the Confederate Camp Johnson and the tiny village of Belmont. Correctly identifying the gathering smoke from Grant&rsquo;s little fleet, Polk still vacillated before dispatching General Pillow and four Tennessee Regiments to reinforce General Tappan&rsquo;s Arkansans on the Missouri side of the river. U.S. Commander Walke led his gunboats into a brief artillery battle with the Iron Banks batteries but soon withdrew his battered vessels. By 8;30 a.m. Grant marched on the rebel Camp. By 10:00 am the battle commenced.&#10;&#10;Soldiers fought across heavy woods, clear fields and cornfields. Pillow showed poor judgement. In short order his demoralized men retreated north and south of their camp while the Yankees celebrated their victory. Grant briefly lost control. His officers and men ignored him as they looted the abandoned camp. General McClernand even took time to mount a stump and give a political speech. Finally roused to action, Polk ordered his Iron banks batteries to fire on Camp Johnson as General Cheatham and five additional regiments shuttled across the river. Exposed Union companies were decimated by the re-energized confederates. Many Northerners had their retreat cut off. The fight continued all the way back to the ships. Grant found himself the last man aboard.&#10;&#10;Belmont&rsquo;s butcher bill left 320 Union dead, 400 wounded &ndash; 100 of whom were captured along with another 100 healthy men. The confederates lost 105 killed, 419 wounded and 117 missing. Despite the casualties the battle was ultimately inconclusive and both sides claimed victory. Grant captured and destroyed an enemy camp but at a horrendous cost. On the other hand, Polk and Pillow showed hesitation and poor judgement something Grant would use against them in later battles. The rebels had forced Grant and his Yankees to quit the field only after he had created a core of skilled veterans displaying the courage and determination eventually to earn him command of all the Union forces.&#10;&#10;Belmont is to be a COMPASS, PAPER WARS Magazine game based on John Poniske's Ball's Bluff design &hellip; significantly expanded. This is a two player, hex-based game on the company level. It offers a 22&quot; x 34&quot; Map (Created by Rick Barber), 226 9/16&quot; counters (Featuring the artistry of Bill Morgal, 1 Rulebook and Player Aids. It is a chit-draw system with a unique see-saw Confused Orders mechanic which simulates the confusion of ACW battle. The game employs infantry, artillery, cavalry and gunboat rules. Players involve their troops in three types of battle, Volley Fire, Passing Fire and Melee. To enhance battlefield confusion, advancing into melee may cause loss of control and further advance than a player wishes. Grant's aggressive nature is simulated by a limited number of rerolls within his leadership range.&#10;&#10;From Compass Games Website (https://www.compassgames.com/paperwars/issue-87-magazine-game-belmont.html):&#10;&#10;Paper Wars Issue #87 (Fall 2017 issue) (Magazine &amp; Game)&#10;&#10;&quot;Belmont &ndash; Grant's [Baptism of Command], November 7, 1861&quot;, by John Poniske&#10;&#10;&quot;Ulysses Grant &ndash; who is he? Prior to the battle of Belmont at Belmont on November 7, 1861, this was a valid question. General Grant&rsquo;s Belmont offensive was his first action in the war, providing him and his green mid-western troops much-needed experience. Having overrun a rebel camp, he claimed victory. But later, Confederate general Polk would claim victory for forcing Grant and his troops to quit the battlefield and chasing them aboard their transports.&quot;&#10;&#10;Complexity: Medium&#10;&#10;Solitaire suitability: High&#10;&#10;Map scale: 225 yards/hex&#10;&#10;Unit scale: Company&#10;&#10;1 Map and 1 Countersheet&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "ENG&#10;&#10;From one of the most hidden laboratories in the Atomic Biochemistry Brave Academy (ABBA), a shout rises to the skies: &ldquo;&iexcl;Eureka!&rdquo;.  After years of research, Professor R&ouml;ntgen has invented a new thingamajig that apparently is capable of modifying the atomic composition of objects, to the point it can make them shrink and grow at will.  But the underworld of science is horrifying and his &ldquo;colleague&rdquo;, archrival and former student, Professor Stern, wants to steal his idea.  In the next few days, the Academy is going to decide which department will get funds to continue their research, so lab safety has become a secondary concern.  Both professors must use their scientists and students wisely, to get the most astonishing test results, while discretely trying to sabotage your rival.&#10;&#10;To get the best experimental samples, you must use the ray to manipulate the value and size of your dice, while you sabotage your opponent, by modifying his.  The higher the visible value on the die, and the smaller the die is, the more points you will get.   To win the game (and get the funds!), you will have to get the most points with this method.&#10;&#10;During your turn, you can perform one or more actions (without repeating any).  The available actions are represented on the control panel board, and you will use scientists and students to trigger them.  Each turn is played in three consecutive steps.  Once you're finished, it&rsquo;s your opponent's turn, and so on until the end of the game.  These are the three steps:&#10;&#10;Action Selection: Choose the actions you want to perform this turn.  First, pick a student from your hand and place in in the control panel, covering the action it&rsquo;s going to perform. Then, use your available scientists to select one or more actions, as explained below.  Note:  you can&rsquo;t repeat the action on a student card.&#10;Action resolution: In whatever order you choose, perform your selected actions, taking back the corresponding scientists and students as you do. Student cards go straight to the discard pile, but you get your scientist team back for next turn.  If you haven&rsquo;t shot the ray this turn, take the extra scientist, aside from your two regular ones.  This additional scientist will help you during your next turn.  If it is already in your possession, and you have shot the ray this turn, put it back, next to the testing room board.&#10;Hiring a new student: Once you have solved all the actions, draw a new student card from the deck.  You will continue drawing cards every turn until the deck is over.  Once the deck is depleted, keep playing your cards from your hand normally.  Once all students have been used (players don&rsquo;t have available student cards in their hands), shuffle the student cards deck to form a new face down pile on the table.  Both players draw two new student cards and continue playing normally.&#10;&#10;SPA&#10;&#10;De uno de los laboratorios m&aacute;s perdidos de la Atomic Biochemistry Brave Academy (ABBA), surge un grito que clama al cielo: &ldquo;&iexcl;Eureka!&rdquo;.  Tras a&ntilde;os de investigaci&oacute;n, el profesor R&ouml;ntgen ha inventado un nuevo cachivache que parece ser capaz de modificar la composici&oacute;n at&oacute;mica de los objetos, hasta el punto de poder reducirlos y aumentarlos a su antojo.  Pero los bajos fondos del mundo cient&iacute;fico son repugnantes y su &quot;colega&quot;, archienemigo y antiguo alumno suyo, el profesor Stern, est&aacute; decidido a robarle la idea. Y es que en los pr&oacute;ximos d&iacute;as se determina qu&eacute; departamento obtiene la subvenci&oacute;n de la academia para continuar con su trabajo, as&iacute; que la seguridad de los experimentos se ha convertido en algo secundario.  Ambos profesores deben emplear a sus estudiantes eficientemente para tratar de obtener los resultados m&aacute;s espectaculares posibles, mientras tratan de sabotear discretamente a su rival.&#10;&#10;Para conseguir las mejores muestras experimentales, debes utilizar el rayo para manipular el valor y el tama&ntilde;o de los dados de tu color, a la vez que saboteas a tu oponente modificando los suyos.  Contra mayor sea el valor de un dado y menor sea su tama&ntilde;o, m&aacute;s puntos otorga al jugador de ese color. Para ganar la partida (&iexcl;y hacerte con la subvenci&oacute;n!), tendr&aacute;s que ser t&uacute; el que consiga m&aacute;s puntos de este modo.&#10;&#10;Durante tu turno puedes realizar una o m&aacute;s acciones (sin repetir ninguna). Las acciones disponibles est&aacute;n representadas en el tablero a modo de cuadro de mandos, y para realizarlas necesitas emplear cient&iacute;ficos y estudiantes.  Los turnos se juegan en tres pasos consecutivos. Cuando los termines, le toca jugar a tu oponente y os ir&eacute;is turnando as&iacute; hasta que acabe la partida. Los pasos son los siguientes:&#10;&#10;1.       Selecci&oacute;n de acciones: Selecciona las acciones a realizar. Elige un estudiante de tu mano y ponlo en el cuadro de mandos, de forma que tape la acci&oacute;n correspondiente. A continuaci&oacute;n, emplea a tus cient&iacute;ficos para seleccionar una o m&aacute;s acciones, seg&uacute;n el caso, como se explica m&aacute;s abajo. Nota:  no puedes repetir la acci&oacute;n de la carta de estudiante.&#10;2.       Resoluci&oacute;n de acciones: En el orden que desees, resuelve cada una de las acciones seleccionadas, retirando al hacerlo al estudiante o cient&iacute;ficos correspondientes. Las cartas de estudiante retiradas van a al mazo de descarte, pero los cient&iacute;ficos los recuperas para tu siguiente turno. Si no has disparado en este turno, adem&aacute;s de tus 2 cient&iacute;ficos, coge tambi&eacute;n al cient&iacute;fico extra, que te ayudar&aacute; durante el turno siguiente. Si ya lo ten&iacute;as y en este turno has disparado, devu&eacute;lvelo.&#10;3.       Reclutar un nuevo estudiante: Una vez resueltas las acciones, roba una nueva carta. Deber&aacute;s seguir robando al final de cada turno hasta que se acabe el mazo de robo.  Una vez se acabe el mazo de robo, seguir&aacute;s jugando con las cartas que te queden en la mano. Cuando se haya empleado a todos los estudiantes (no tengas cartas en la mano), vuelve a barajar los estudiantes para formar un nuevo mazo de robo y robad dos cartas cada uno, para continuar normalmente.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Minden Playing Card Cricket has been around since the early 1980s and is one of the best of the stats-based cricket games. Each &lsquo;turn&rsquo; of the game simulates an over of Test or One Day Cricket. Turns are resolved by using a regular deck of playing cards instead of rolling dice, although six sided dice are used to resolve some plays. The device of replicating a single over per turn is perfect, as full test matches can be played over several hours, while one day games can be played out in a single session. The system ingeniously allows for hat tricks, batting collapses, batsmen playing themselves in, and batsman playing with confidence. There are two forms of the game. Basic, which only include some rules and in which players are not individually carded (although they do have individual stats) and the Advanced Game, in which each player has a unique card.&#10;&#10;It produces a very convincing range of scores and excitement (perhaps rather more than the real game does). Extremely clever.&#10;&#10;The 5th Edition of this game is now available from mindencricket.com&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "From The Complete Book of Indoor Games by Peter Arnold:&#10;&#10;Klabberjass is probably best known in America than in England, because under the names of Clabber,Clobber, Clubby, Klab and Klob, it occurs in Damon Runyon's amusing stories,and in 1937 a variation of the game, jo-jotte was publicized by Ely Culbertson. Despite the simularity of names it is not idenical with the Hungarian game of kalabrias, which is a game for three or four players. There may have been a common ancestor, or possibly the game was taken to the New World by Central European immigrants and there bowdlerized version of kalabrias. (Exeter Books, 1984)&#10;&#10;Klabberjass is played in the North American and Great Britain with the 32 card deck. (6s, 5s,4s,3s, and 2s removed from the standard 52 card deck.) The trump suit enjoys the strange ranking of the Jass genre: J 9 A 10 K Q 8 7. Non trump suit rank A 10 K Q J 9 8 7 as in the Skat-Pinochle family. Six cards are dealt to each player and a card is turned up. Non-dealer then begins a bidding round to first to accept the turn-up as trump. Or pass. If both pass on the turn-up card a second round is held. Here the non-dealer may take the bid by naming one of the other three suits or pass, dealer than may take the bid by naming the suit of throw in the hand. (Some allow for a bid of &quot;Schmeiss&quot; which means to the bidder will take the hand with the turn-up or the hand can be thrown in at the non-bidders discretion)&#10;&#10;After bidding, the dealer deals three more cards to the hand. Then sequences are scored. For this purpose the cards revert back to their numeral rank. A sequence of three scores 20 and a sequence of 4 or more scores 50. tiebreakers are decided by rank. As I will describe later, it may make sense not to score in this round and you are not obligated to do so.&#10;&#10;Non-dealer leads to first trick. A player must follow suit. If he cannot he must trump if able. If trump is lead he must play a higher trump if able. If he holds the King and Queen of trump he may announce &quot;Bella&quot; on play of the second card and score 50 points. Once again he may choose not to score for this.&#10;&#10;After the cards are played, both score for the following cards won:&#10;&#10;Jass (Jack of Trumps) 20 points&#10;Menel (9 of Trumps) 14 points.&#10;Any Ace 11 points&#10;Any 10 10 points.&#10;Any King 4 points.&#10;Any Queen 3 points.&#10;Any Jack 2 points.&#10;Last Trick 10 points.&#10;&#10;If the the high bidder (The one who established trump) scores the highest, both sides score what they made. If if opponent scores higher he scores for both totals. This is why the high bidder who realizes he is not going to beat his opponent in this hand may decide not to score or &quot;Sink&quot; points during the hand. 500 points wins the round.&#10;&#10;Prior to the onset of Gin Rummy, this was the most popular two handed game in the United States. It still holds a loyal following.&#10;&#10;Klabberjass remains a popular two handed game in the United States. There are several variations in play and several house rules. It is very popular in New England and especially Hartford, Connecticut.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "A Game of Politics about the Game of Politics.&#10;&#10;You control one of the aspiring leaders of Humerica and gradually assemble a powerful coalition of factions to help you gain votes, wealth, and power. Each faction gives you a unique exploit that helps you or harms your opponents. Survive unexpected events, strive to win elections, fundraise from your wealthiest factions and, if you like, abscond with the money and purchase investments. The player with the most power wins!&#10;&#10;The game features satirical artwork that satirizes American interest groups, voting blocks, and political candidates.&#10;&#10;Each player receives a leader card at the start of the game and 5 faction cards. Each turn, a player can &#10;1. campaign (varies with leader, but usually is draw 1 card) or embezzle (get $2)&#10;2. sneak (play 2 cards face down), exploit (play 1 faction card and use the ability listed on the card), or fundraise (get money equal to your total wealth.)&#10;3. use their leader superpower (this costs money, and some superpowers can be used even when it is not your turn.)&#10;&#10;There are 10 rounds. At the end of each round there is an event. Events can have positive or negative effects on players, usually negative. 3 of those events are elections, with the very last event being a presidential election.&#10;&#10;Faction cards have three stats: votes, wealth, and power. They also have either an exploit ability (used when &quot;exploiting&quot;) or a surprise ability (an effect you get if you discard the card, usually in response to another player doing something).&#10;&#10;Money (called MegaBucks) can also be used to purchase investments (there are 4 face up at any time) that vary in how many influence points they give you at the end of the game. Some also let you draw cards immediately or affect vote totals.&#10;&#10;Each player develops their board over the ten rounds, adding factions to their coalition of supporters, purchasing investments, trying to win elections, and using the exploit and surprise abilities listed on their faction cards, as well as the superpower listed on their leader, to interfere with opponents or improve their own position.&#10;&#10;Designed by Brandon Patton and Andre Pereira.

Sunflower Valley: A Tile-Laying Game, is a fast-paced drafting and tableau-building game in which 2-6 players settle their own mountain valleys.&#10;&#10;Each player has a starting town card, a Valley Express train token that starts on this card, and a deck of twenty cards the same color as their starting town. Reveal three of the nine goal cards at random.&#10;&#10;The game lasts three rounds, and each round plays out the same way: Draw a hand of seven cards from your deck. All players choose and reveal one card from their hand, then place this card orthogonally adjacent to another card in their valley. Pass the remaining cards in your hand to the player on your left. Repeat this process until you have placed six cards. Place the final card in hand on the bottom of your deck. If you connect railroad track to your starting town, then connect a town card to that track, move your Valley Express train token to the new town; keep moving this token for each new town added to your network this way.&#10;&#10;After three rounds, you'll have 19 cards in your tableau, and you score points for these played cards:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Each lake is worth 1 point.&#10;    Sheep and sunflower fields are worth no points on their own, but they help you score other cards.&#10;    Farmers and towns score if they have the indicated number of sheep, field, lake, or mountain cards next to them; farmers count as fields themselves.&#10;    Mountains score based on the number of fields next to them.&#10;&#10;&#10;In addition to these points, score 3 points for each new town visited by your Valley Express train token. Score the goal cards as indicated; some award points only to the player who does the best of something, such as having the most sheep or the longest network of track and trains, whereas others award points &mdash; possibly several times &mdash; for everyone who does something.

If you roll a three of a kind, you must draw a red card. Most of the cards are beneficial, some are risky, depending on the situation and your luck.&#10;&#10;End of the game: The first player to fill all die spaces on their board wins the round and gets a brain.

Every operation requires the expenditure of command points.&#10;&#10;SL has several different scenarios, each covering a critical period of operations: Game Warden (the early years), Tet (the Communist general offensive of 1968), and SEALORDS (the Free World counteroffensive of 1969-70).&#10;&#10;Each map grid square equals 6.21 miles (10 km) across, and each full game turn represents a month.

That is because I will have nothing to do with them. I live here alone with my old sister, who is also my housekeeper. We keep no servants&mdash;I hate them. I have one friend, a dog; yes, I would sooner have old Pepper than the rest of Creation together. He, at least, understands me&mdash;and has sense enough to leave me alone when I am in my dark moods.&#10;&#10;I have decided to start a kind of diary; it may enable me to record some of the thoughts and feelings that I cannot express to anyone; but, beyond this, I am anxious to make some record of the strange things that I have heard and seen, during many years of loneliness, in this weird old building.&#10;&#10;For a couple of centuries, this house has had a reputation, a bad one, and, until I bought it, for more than eighty years no one had lived here; consequently, I got the old place at a ridiculously low figure.&#10;&#10;I am not superstitious; but I have ceased to deny that things happen in this old house&mdash;things that I cannot explain; and, therefore, I must needs ease my mind, by writing down an account of them, to the best of my ability; though, should this, my diary, ever be read when I am gone, the readers will&#10;but shake their heads, and be the more convinced that I was mad.&quot;&#10;&#10;The House on the Borderland&#10;The Plain of Silence&#10;- William Hope Hodgson*&#10;&#10;Game Objective&#10;In an ancient house, a Recluse, his dog Pepper and his sister Mary must survive while exploring its mysteries, and penning a diary until the Luminous Speck appears. Solitaire game only.&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;A single player decides the actions of a Reclusive old man, his dog Pepper, and the Recluse&rsquo;s sister Mary. Each turn is divided into 2 to 4 phases. An untold number of turns will be played. The game will end when the Luminous Speck Noise Tile is drawn. The game can end earlier if all characters are killed on the map. If reaching the Luminous Speck, the player has won well if Recluse is alive with all characters, having written an entire diary, and discovered the mysteries of the house. Characters lost, an incomplete manuscript, and unknown mysteries are less than well.&#10;&#10;&#10;    Based on the book by William Hope Hodgson, House on the Borderland was published in 1908. It was among the first supernatural tales of what would be considered Cosmic Horror. &#10;&#10;&#10;",

Warzone Resurrection is a fast paced, exciting and tactical miniature game created by Prodos Games Ltd. and Paraodox Entertainment.&#10;&#10;The Warzone Resurrection project brings the tabletop game well and truly into the 21st century. Lovingly, we have taken essence and best bits from the game, art and prose of previous editions to produce all new miniatures, a background re-imagining (by Warzone mega-fan and writing genius, Andy Hoare) and an exciting innovative gaming system.&#10;&#10;The gaming system involves both miniatures and cards. The minis are your skirmish force and the cards represent game resources, additional wargear, global and local effects on the battlefield etc.. In a real battle it is likely that a soldier wouldn't know his opponents wargear, whether they have grenades or a laser-sight for example. Both sides might be surprised by a Martian earthquake or Mercurian solar flare. The Venusian jungle cover you are in might be better (or worse) than you thought! War is rarely predictable, especially when it takes place on the planets, planetoids and asteroids of the solar system! All these and many more variables are represented by the cards you and your opponent play. Making Warzone Resurrection a truly novel, realistic and exciting tabletop miniature skirmish game!&#10;&#10;The game brings 7 factions among the Bauhaus, Capital, Cybertronic, Mishima, Imperial, The Brotherhood and the Dark Legion&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Warzone &#10;    Warzone (Second Edition)  &#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;&#10;D-Day at Iwo Jima is a Solitaire wargame simulating the amphibious invasion of Iwo Jima. The five-week battle was some of the bloodiest fighting in the Pacific. In one of the costliest intelligence failures of the war, the planners had completely misjudged the situation that would face the Marines. The beaches had been described as excellent and the advance inland was expected to be easy. Instead, the Marines were faced with 15-foot-high slopes of soft black volcanic ash that brought the normally rapidly moving Marines down to a slow plod. In addition, the lack of a vigorous response led the Marines to believe that the bombardment had completely suppressed the defenses. However, Gen. Kuribayashi was far from beaten. Understanding that his forces were insufficient to defeat the massive American invasion force, he had decided to defend the island in-depth.&#10;&#10;In D-Day at Iwo Jima, designer Joe Youst builds on John Butterfield&rsquo;s award winning solitaire game system. The player controls three US Marine divisions against a determined Japanese defense. The no-dice combat system highlights the unknown enemy deployments and coordination of the right weapon systems and tactics.&#10;&#10;Players familiar with the previous three games in the system will be able to quickly set up and play this latest version. New features include a random fortification generation system that simulates the ability of the Japanese forces to &ldquo;re-fortify&rdquo; supposedly weakened positions and an updated infiltration system that encourages the player to maintain a continuous line.&#10;&#10;Scenarios:&#10;&#10;D-Day (19 February) &ndash; Covers the first day in six turns.&#10;Surabachi (20 to 24 February) &ndash; The 28th Marine Regiment&rsquo;s capture of Surabachi.&#10;Drive to the North (20 to 24 February) &ndash; The attack on Airfield One and advance by the 4th and 5th Marine Divisions.&#10;Hot Rocks (25 February to 4 March) &ndash; The attack to clear the Motoyama Plateau.&#10;Drive to the Sea (6 to 10 March) &ndash; The final attack on the plateau and the end of organized Japanese resistance.&#10;Sands of Iwo Jima Campaign (19 February to 11 March) &ndash; The campaign combines all aspects of the previous scenarios into one look at the entire campaign.&#10;&#10;Game Contents:&#10;&#10;528 Die-cut counters&#10;One 34&rdquo; x 22&rdquo; Mounted Game Board&#10;One 11&rdquo; x 17&rdquo; Set-Up Map&#10;Player Aid Cards&#10;Color Rules booklet&#10;Color Campaign Analysis&#10;55 Event cards&#10;&#10;",

In Mauna Kea, you're exploring a previously unknown volcanic island in the South Pacific with your research team when suddenly there's a terrible roar: The volcano has come to life! Now, you must find as many artifacts as possible and bring them, along with your researchers, to the rescue boats at the coast. If you plan your ways cleverly and have a little bit of luck, you'll survive the volcanic eruption as the rescuing hero!&#10;&#10;Each player starts the game with a team of 3-5 researchers (depending on the number of players) and a set of randomly selected terrain tiles that collectively have at least five movement points; the more jungle spaces on a tile, the more movement points it provides. On a player's turn, he must play all of his tiles in any order he wants, either placing them on the game board to expand the terrain on which players can move or spending the movement points to move his researchers to orthogonally adjacent spaces (1 point to enter jungle, 2 points to enter water, 16,000 points to enter mountain &mdash; actually, you can't enter a mountain space). If his researcher enters a space with an artifact, he then drags that artifact with him as he moves. If his researcher reaches a boat, he fills as many seats as possible with artifacts, then hits the water. Sorry, chumps!&#10;&#10;At the end of his turn, he draws new tiles &mdash; and if he pulls a lava tile from the bag, he places it on the board immediately. Lava flows away from the central cone, with each tile indicating the side of the volcano from which it flows. If lava hits established terrain, it covers that terrain; if it hits researchers and artifacts, it covers them, too. Players continue taking turns until someone has no researchers left on the island, whether due to them leaving the island or donning a lava blanket. Everyone else takes one final turn, then players score, collecting 3 points per saved researcher, 1-3 points for each artifact, and -1 point for each empty space on the boats they used. The player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;In the advanced game, players don't return tiles to the bag when they use them for movement points. Instead they start the game with four action or task cards in hand. They can play as many action cards as they wish on a turn to help their researchers cross mountains, swim faster, or helicopter to safety, but they have only four for the entire game. The game now ends when a player has no researchers or no tile remain in the bag. In addition to their other points, players now score for completed task cards, earning points for specific combinations of artifacts or for taking a certain boat. Again, the player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;",

(In a two-player game, each player controls two colors, but at the start of play they secretly choose one of those colors to be their scoring color, with the other color serving only as a blocking mechanism.) Each player has a matching colored flag that sticks out of their block.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player removes their flag from its current location, adds one cube of their color to the side of any of their blocks (where such a move can be made), then they &quot;grow&quot; their color by adding two blocks in a straight line from the block they just added, crawling around corners and covering other players' blocks if needed. To end your turn, plant your flag in one of your final blocks, ideally blocking where someone else might like to play while also preserving future ground in which you can play.&#10;&#10;Once all the blocks have been placed, you calculate your score by looking at the structure from all four surrounding sides, as well as from the top, and counting each unblocked square of your color that is visible. Thus, if you plant a block high up on the cube, you can possibly score 5 points for it since it would be seen from all sides and the top. Climb high, and block others from blocking you!&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Help save endangered butterflies! Construction projects in your city are disrupting the natural butterfly habitat. Capture  butterflies and deliver them to protected butterfly gardens in local zoos, botanical gardens, and museums.&#10;&#10;The game is played in a series of rounds. Players start each round by playing a card from their hands to determine the round's turn order. Cards are numbered from 0 to 59, and lower numbered cards go first. On a turn, a player captures butterflies from the field and adds them to the jar. When possible, players &quot;deliver butterflies&quot; from their jars to the different butterfly gardens to score victory points (VPs). Which butterflies can be delivered is indicated on the face-up &quot;delivery cards&quot; and players are often in a race to deliver butterflies to take the cards and score points. The player with the most VPs at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;During the game, players must carefully decide which butterfly cards to play. By playing lowered numbered cards, players not only get a better pick of butterflies in the field, but they also get first chance at delivering butterflies. However, lower numbered butterfly cards usually have fewer butterflies on them, so players cannot add as many to their jars. Also, butterfly cards with special powers usually have high numbers, so you often must sacrifice turn order in order to use one of these special powers.&#10;&#10;In this second edition, the artwork and components have been upgraded. A major rule change is a new set-collection aspect of the delivery cards. There are now 4 types of delivery cards and players score a bonus for having a variety. Also, there are some minor rule changes with scoring butterflies in one's hand and jar at game end. Another small change is in the special powers on some of the cards.&#10;  &#10;The maximum number of players in the second edition was lowered to 5 from 6.&#10;&#10;",

Once upon a time, they worked in unison to temper Nature's fury. Now, capricious and vainglorious, they challenge each other to see whose seasonal power will rule for the next twelve months.&#10;&#10;Seasons of Arcadia is a deeply strategic, yet very approachable game. Players assume the roles of powerful faerie lords, each attempting to dominate the entire year with their seasonal magic.&#10;&#10;The goal is simple: Be the first to place all twelve of your lords on the board to achieve victory. Players take turns placing, moving, and jumping opposing faerie lord pieces on a hex board. Each season can both replace and be replaced by one other season, so defense is as important in offense in determining where you place and move.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Sometimes this is exactly what you must do!&#10;&#10;Espresso Doppio contains three espresso cups, saucers, and spoons in three colors, and your goal during the game is to place them and move them on the placemat to match the combinations depicted on your task cards.&#10;&#10;To set up, shuffle the deck of 16 task cards and give half to each player, each of whom reveals three cards face up. Players take turns placing items one at a time on the placemat, which has room for five settings on it. You can mix or match colors as you wish, but two of the same item (saucer, cup, spoon) can never be on the same setting. On a turn, you take 1-3 actions, with an action consisting of moving any one item from one setting to another or swapping items on one setting for items on another setting. After your actions, you score coffee beans for whatever task cards you can, with some cards scoring multiple times if the conditions are right.&#10;&#10;As soon as a player has scored all eight cards, the players swap their decks of task cards, shuffle them, then reveal three task cards and continue playing. Once a player has scored eight cards in the second round of play, the game ends and whoever has collected the most coffee beans wins.&#10;&#10;",
