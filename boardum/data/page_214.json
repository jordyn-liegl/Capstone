Players compete in international trade for vital resources: minerals, oil and grain. Speculate and trade commodities on the world market. A strong economy fuels the arms race as you build armies, navies, nukes and a &quot;star-wars&quot; defense system. Borrow money from the world bank or invest in bonds to increase your income. Don't borrow too much or the crushing interest will bankrupt you!&#10;&#10;As conflicts and nuclear arsenals grow, the world becomes a much more dangerous place. A nuclear strike may vanquish an enemy, but will the retaliation trigger a nuclear winter destroying the world? To win, you'll need a delicate balance of diplomacy, economic and military strength. You must form alliances, negotiate, threaten and bluff. Many strategies can lead to victory &ndash; but only one superpower will achieve supremacy.&#10;&#10;This redesign of the classic cold war game Supremacy has an updated map and currency for the 21st century, along with corrected and streamlined rules to make the game faster, simpler and more intense.&#10;&#10;",

The bottom left corner, the center and the top right corner are starting spaces for the three musketeers. All other spaces are initially occupied by &quot;enemies.&quot; Musketeers can only move to adjacent spaces with an enemy piece, which is captured by this move. Enemies can only move to empty adjacent spaces. Enemies win if all three musketeers are ever on the same line or column. Musketeers win as soon as they run out of legal moves.&#10;&#10;Musketeers will start the game. According to Wikipedia the game was strongly solved in 2009 by Johannes Laire. The enemies (that could be called Cardinal Richelieu's men) can always force a own win. References are missing but due to the restricted amount of available moves for the Musketeers and the strict, clear, and simple rule set proof is possible with acceptable effort with same result.&#10;&#10;",

At the beginning of the game, players get two of these Keeyplings to pick from.&#10;&#10;There are two main phases in The Keeyp, first the exploring phase and then the combat phase. You can explore a new area by moving your player, up to the number of speed you have, then drawing and laying down a Keeyp Tile. A Keeyp Tile can be a tunnel, crossroads, treasure chest, traps, and more.&#10;&#10;Players will spend the first half of the game building out the map and finding treasure chests to collect weapons, shields, and items. Once the Key has been found, the combat phases begins. You can attack a player by landing on the same tile as them. Combat is determined by the players ATK stat verses the defending players DEF stat. These stats can be increased by using items. If your Keeypling is defeated, you then use your second Keeypling. If that Keeypling is defeated then you are out of the game.&#10;&#10;There are two different ways to win in The Keeyp:&#10;&#10;1. Safely make your way to the Gate Tile while holding the Key. (You can steal the Key from a player by defeating them in combat.)&#10;2. Defeating everyone in your path, while destroying friendships in the process.&#10;&#10;Along the way there are traps and random events that damage the player, move the key back to the key tile, send you across the map, and even lose your turn. The dungeon feels like it's constantly changing making it strategic but enjoyably chaotic.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

New towns were born, where many adventurers, soldiers of fortune even robbers were living. On the roads public security was nil. Brave travellers, hunters, miners were much threatened. The players drop in to this venturesome world written by Charles May as well. Their goal is to pass through the marked direction at least five to six times amid many adventures and dangers and to gain as many mining, fishing and hunting fields as possible. In the fields where the treasure of the Silver Lake is hidden gold nuggets are found which are brought by the Bank of New Orleans presuming that the player is not robbed along the way. The winner is, who made the biggest fortune at the end. We wish you exciting adventures on the way! (straight from the back of the box)&#10;&#10;This monopoly-type game is based on the book Der Schatz im Silbersee (in Hungarian: Az Ez&uuml;st-t&oacute; kincse) by Karl May. Players can buy fishery, shooting and mining concessions instead of buying properties.&#10;&#10;",

Welcome to the grim world where a road lined with dead bodies of enemies leads to a happy ending!&#10;&#10;The goal of GrimmoiR is to defeat the opponent's character. At the beginning of the game, each player chooses six characters and take five energy points; the randomly selected first player begins the first round with one energy point less. The first player chooses and puts one character in the front line on the table. Then second player places their first character in front of that character and second character in the back line, right behind their first character. The first player selects the next two characters, places one to the back line behind the already placed character, and the second to the front line on any side of already placed cards. Repeat the process until each player has six characters in the battlefield: three in the front, and three in the back.&#10;&#10;Players take one action in turn. They pay energy points for the action. The action includes:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Character activation&#10;     Movement of the character&#10;&#10;&#10;The player pays one energy point to activate the character. Activation includes both attack and the use of character special skills. If a player wants to activate a tired character, they can do it, but they must pay two energy points. A player can't activate a tired character if any of their characters is still ready.&#10;&#10;The game lasts until one of the players defeats all of the opponent's characters.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

There is only one card marked 1, whereas there are two cards marked 2, three cards marked 3, etc., and ten cards marked 10.

If the player draws a card which number already appears on one of the cards of the series, he keeps the last card he drew and his turn ends. The next player will choose either to keep the current series, or to return the series&rsquo; cards to the bottom of the deck.&#10;     Or stopping the current series and taking all the cards it is made of before a pair is formed. The player&rsquo;s turn ends.&#10;     Or discarding a card with a &quot;Judge&quot; symbol to examine the top three cards in the deck and rearrange them in the order of his choice.&#10;&#10;&#10;Before performing any of these three actions, the active player must wait for each of his opponents to:&#10;&#10;     Either raise his hand in agreement.&#10;     Or place (once per player during a series of figures) one of his cards in front of the active player&rsquo;s series so as to confront him, and dare him to perform another figure. If the active player refuses the challenge or accepts it and loses, his turn ends and the player who dared him takes his card back and turns it over; now the card is worth 3 stars. If the active player accepts the challenge and succeeds, he immediately takes the card that was bet, he puts it in his stock and his turn goes on.&#10;&#10;&#10;At any time, a player can turn over a card won during a successful challenge (i.e., a face down card) and draw the card at the bottom of the deck.&#10;&#10;End of game&#10;The game ends when the last card of the deck is drawn. The cards face up are worth one or two stars whereas the cards face down (from a successful bet) are worth three stars.

Houses are built down in alternating colors from king to ace.&#10;&#10;Some moves in the game are compulsory:&#10; -- if the top card of the reserve may be played to a foundation, that play must be made first.&#10; -- if an available card in the houses can be played to the foundations, that play must be made.&#10; -- if any house is empty, one must fill the space from the reserve if possible.&#10; -- whenever the top card from the reserve is played, the next reserve card must be turned face up.&#10;&#10;If none of the above moves are available, the player turns the top card of his hand face up and continues play.  The player may play the card legally as any other card.  Likewise, a player may play a cards to his opponent's waste pile if the card played matches in suit and is of a consecutive rank.  Once a player has no more legal moves, his face-up hand it is discarded into the player's waste pile and his turn ends.

Each player has a  still tennis player figure which is used to volley the ball back and forth across the net.  Under each player, and under the translucent surface of the board is the movement paddle for that player, which dictates how far the playing figure could move for the subsequent turn.  The game field is set up just like a tennis court, with the requisite lines and a net, and the players volley a soft tufted &quot;tennis ball&quot;.  One player serves the ball, and if it lands within the fair territory, the receiving player checks to see if it fell within their movement paddle space.  That player then moves the center of their paddle under the ball and uses their figure to return the ball, and so on until one player scores by their opponent knocking the ball out of play, or by playing the ball in a space where their opponent cannot reach it within their movement zone.  All of the ball volleying is performed by tensing back the racket of the playing figure, and then releasing it to launch the ball across the net.  Scoring is handled just like regular tennis scoring.&#10;&#10;",

The goal of this game is to sway the majority of delegates in you favor in order to be nominated as the candidate to run for office and win the game. In other words, by fulfilling the task given by &quot;headline cards&quot; you are able to conquer states &#10;with different numbers of delegates. These delegates will be counted in the end of the game and the player who has gathered the most delegates wins.&#10;&#10;In  more detail:&#10;&#10;You play for four rounds to complete the game. Each round has an identical structure and entails six game phases. Each player needs to complete the ongoing game phase before the subsequent phase can begin.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Drawing of headline cards&#10;     Rolling, selecting and placing the dice&#10;     Fulfilling headline card tasks (if possible)&#10;     Winning states&#10;     Drawing bonus cards (if possible)&#10;     Discarding headline cards and changing of starting player&#10;&#10;&#10;After the fourth round, each player counts his gathered delegates and a winner is declared.&#10;&#10;A central game mechanism is the inclusion of dice in each of the four phases. Each number of die represents a different voting group. In order to fulfill a &quot;headline card&quot; you need to collect a certain number or combination of dice.&#10;&#10;There are 24 dice in the game. All dice are being used regardless of the number of players playing. When it is your turn, you take six dice and roll them once. You can influence the outcome of your roll with your character card&rsquo;s ability to manipulate dice or in other words &quot;voters&quot;. Afterwards, you can either select two dice of any number or all dice of the same number and place them on according voter grounds on the game board.&#10;&#10;You can manipulate the result of your roll with you character card. Each character has one voter group which follows him or her unconditionally and will opportunistically adopt any opinion. If a player rolls the number or numbers of his voter group, he can turn this or these dice onto any desired side.&#10;&#10;You will roll the dice, one after another until there are 20 dice placed voter groups.&#10;&#10;This game is not intended or meant to be disrespectful towards anyone. It does not aim at ridiculing anyone. Much rather, we would like all of us to be able to have a good chuckle over a board game which does not take itself seriously.&#10;&#10;The satirical aspect of the game makes fun of the current political discourse of politicians, news media and pundits which seem to be much more about exaggeration, stereotyping, provocation and polarization than about discussion and consensus. More so, it seems that these days one is more successful as a politician being loud, oversimplifying and hyperbolical than reflective and reasonable. This is a trend which is in no way limited to the United States. We see it everywhere.&#10;&#10;This idea is at the core of the game mechanics itself, most visible in our headline cards. On each card you find a totally exaggerated and ridiculous headline but at the same time the headline cards give you a task which you need to fulfill in order to win the game. So, if you fulfill the headline card or, in terms of the narrative of the cards, if you act as ridiculously as the headlines states you are successful in the political race.&#10;&#10;The game, its cards and figures are fictional &ndash; not so much informed by real persona &ndash; but instead focusing on the stereotypes, simplifications and generalizations visible in news coverage and popular culture.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Tactics was released in 1983 as a 25th Anniversary Edition of the first commercial cardboard-counter wargame. The original Tactics was notable for being the game that inspired Charles S. Roberts to found wargame giant The Avalon Hill Game Co. Since Tactics was a particularly rare wargame, it was an especially appropriate candidate for an The Avalon Hill Game Co anniversary reprint.&#10;&#10;Tactics bore several similarities to both the original 1954 edition of Tactics and its 1958 redesign, Tactics II. The primary difference in the 25th Anniversary Edition was the unique mapboard layout. The map used in Tactics was said to have been based on an unpublished prototype that Charles S. Roberts had created for the original Tactics. In addition, the Anniversary Edition also included a colorful booklet which provided an illustrated overview of the first 25 years of The Avalon Hill Game Co.&#10;&#10;",

Which of the combatants, Order or Chaos, shall win? And can the forces of Neutrality maintain the precarious balance of power . . . An exciting, fast moving game of movement and combat in a fantastic world, where skill and strategy will decide the winner.&quot;&#10;&#10;From the Introduction: &quot;It is a game of two to six players, each player being represented by a leader in the game. Players must decide before the game starts whether to be a Lord or Wizard. In addition, a player must also decide whether his leader is to follow Order, Neutrality, or Chaos. These three alignments determine the type of leader, and what that leader can do during the game.&quot;&#10;&#10;From the Designer's Notes: &quot;Lords and Wizards is not just a game; it's an experience. There is nothing quite like the feeling of outwitting an opponent on the field of battle, or in setting up grand alliances, or in stabbing allies in the back, or in discovering lost legends, or in dealing with rebellions, or in avoiding the plague, or in being confounded by the weather, or in.well, you see what I mean.&quot;&#10;&#10;Components: 72 page 8.5x11&quot; rulebook, 800 die-cut counters, 28x22&quot; map sheet, 4 cardstock game cards, six-sided die, color FGU catalog folder, FGU order sheet.&#10;&#10;",

The HI-LO chip is in the center of the table showing one side of it. On a turn, you play a card from your hand onto the discard pile that is either higher or lower (depending on the HI-LO chip) than the current top card. If you can't play, then flip the chip. If it lands on the opposite side, play a card, then end your turn; if not, then draw a card, playing it immediately, if possible. If you still can't play, then whoever played most recently claims all of the cards in the discard pile, then you play whatever card you want.&#10;&#10;If you play a card that ends with a 1, then the next player draws a card and skips their turn. If the card ends in a 2, then you must play again.&#10;&#10;When someone runs out of cards, they collect the discard pile, then players tally their points for cards collected, with cards ending in 0 being worth 10 points and all other cards 1 point. The player who went out scores a bonus of 10 points. Complete multiple rounds until a player scores more than 75 points, with whoever has the highest score at that point winning the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Smiles &amp; Daggers is based on one of the most famous dilemmas of game theory. The term counter-competition, a neologism invented by the authors, describes the main mechanism of the game. It is a competitive game in which victory is more achievable through co-operation, but there can be only one winner. In other words, keep your friends close, but your enemies closer!&#10;&#10;The Lady kills the Knight, the Lord kills the Lady but gets killed by Knights. You have to choose one card to put face down in front of you. Your opponent will do the same, whilst other players are betting on the outcome. Each card has two sides: one smiling that gives you money, the other kills (if possible) the opponent.&#10;&#10;Which side will you choose? And most importantly, which side is under your opponent's card?&#10;&#10;",

Through the project, called &quot;The Perfect Game&quot;, we have tried to create a perfect game. So, everyone could vote for: the game system, duration of the game, number of players, concept, title and artwork. The gamers decided upon the elements and the basis. On this basis, people could send in games concepts, add from those, Tycho van den Broek emerged as the winner. 999Games has developed the concept and the wishes of the voters into a complete game!&#10;&#10;In this exciting board game, players found a new city. This develops through the construction of new buildings, growing the number of Burghers (&quot;Poorters&quot;) that live there. As prosperity increases, the Burghers replace the surrounding forest wuth green pastures and waving fields of grain. In the city, stately mansions are erected and is worked at the City Hall, the Hospice and other community buildings.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you always choose a character, such as the Lumberjack or the Sheriff. THen, all players can perform this character's action. You get a privilege added to this action. You can earn points by placing buildings and selling much needed food. The game includes different specialists such as the Baker, the Fishmonger and the Tavern. As a result, there are infinitely many strategic options. But the Middle Ages were certainly not free of hazards such as crime, wolves plague and the Black Death, which may appear through the playing of cards. If you are the first to score 30 points, you win the game.&#10;&#10;",

The last king of the House of &Aacute;rp&aacute;d, III. Andr&aacute;s is likely to be a victim of poisoning and the real power is in the hands of the most powerful barons, who rule as kings in their own realm. Waging war against each other, the country is essentially torn into several parts. Everyone is preparing for the final showdown... and the war has begun!&#10;&#10;The country is divided into six provinces, each ruled by a different baron and all they want is the crown. But only one of them can succeed! The game is about this decade, until K&aacute;roly R&oacute;bert consolidates his power. Diplomacy has a very important role, from the money you gather you have to bid on the offices of the Palatine, the Judge and the Treasurer. The game is immediately won, if someone manages to acquire all three offices, or the barons of the other players are defeated and killed in battle, or specified castles are occupied or rules 3-4 separate parts of the country. Lots of intrigue and bloody battles are waiting!&#10;&#10;We can call Sword and Crown the Hungarian version of the well-known game Risk, but with completely unique solutions, even greater game experience, with real battles, sieges, where only the size of your army and the dice rolls decide the outcome of a battle.&#10;&#10;Andr&aacute;s has died, with him the House of &Aacute;rp&aacute;d.

    "description": "In Airport, the goal is to create the most profitable airline. The players start with a fixed number of aircraft which they distribute among the routes on the board. They then take turns rolling dice and moving their counters around the board.&#10;&#10;When a player lands on certain squares, he is paid for all aircraft he has on a particular route. The more aircraft there are on a single route, the lower the payment received for each aircraft. For example; on the New York to Seattle route, one aircraft will make $40,000. If there are 5 aircraft on the route, then each aircraft will earn $15,000, for a total of $75,000. All players receive payment for their aircraft on the route regardless of who landed on the square. Other squares on the board require the players to make certain payments (such as landing fees or ground service charges).&#10;&#10;The players are also required to perform maintenance on their aircraft. Airport cards can be drawn which give individual players bonuses (such as a mail cargo route) or penalties (such as a strike). The players also have the option of buying or leasing new aircraft or of selling old aircraft back to the bank. The first player to reach a net worth of one million dollars is the winner.&#10;&#10;This game is another variant on the venerable Monopoly game. The varying amount of payment based on the number of aircraft on a route is actually somewhat realistic, but otherwise it has about as much to do with how airlines are actually run as Monopoly does with actual real estate investment. But the flavor is good, and the game is interesting to play and reasonably fast. It can be seen as a foreshadowing of Avalon Hill's Air Baron.&#10;&#10;",

Under the title &lsquo;Coco-Nut&rsquo;, Michael Feldkotter had submitted this game as part of the SAZ competition for game authors at last year&rsquo;s Essen fair. Alan R. Moon had run the competition and fronted the prize money; 9 authors with a total of 16 prototypes entered. This game won first prize.&#10;&#10;The great totem pole competition is being held among the Tenakee Indians. Those taking part want to show off the most beautiful and valuable totem poles. But the poles are only scored when it gets a point, so that the Indians like to annoy each other by climbing up and putting points on poles. At the same time, the squaws are using the event to search for a man. Which carver is brave enough to climb the high totem poles?&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "In Matschig, players sling mud at one another by throwing water and sand cards. Well, okay, not literally throwing the cards, but you get the idea.&#10;&#10;To start the game, each player receives a hand of seven cards from the 110-card deck; card types are water, sand, umbrella and special. On a turn, the active player takes one sand and one water card from his hand to create mud, then hurls it at another player. (Again, not literally...) That player has a chance to defend herself by playing umbrella cards to block either the sand or water or both, or by playing special cards that, for example, redirect the mud back to the thrower or spread it out on all other players. Other players can add to someone's attack in order to make the perfect mix of mud &ndash; e.g., adding a 1-value water to a muddy mix of 5-value sand and 4-value water &ndash; and by making the perfect mix, they get to redirect the attack at any player.&#10;&#10;After the mudball hits its target or splats on someone's shield, each player refills her hand to seven cards, then the player who was hit in the previous round starts the new round by choosing a target and throwing. The game continues until the deck runs out of cards, in which case players shuffle discarded cards in order to finish the final round. Players then tally the sand and water points in front of them, and the player with the lowest score wins.&#10;&#10;",

In each round every player tries to collect a precise set of cards, called a phase, by drawing cards from the deck and discarding unneeded ones. When a player collects the phase, he lies it down on the table. After that he tries to discard all of his remaining cards by adding them to any of the phases that are already on the table. When the first player discards all of his cards, the round ends. The players who have lied down their phases get to the next phase. And those, who didn't manage to complete the Phase remain in it and in the next round try to collect and lie down the same phase. The game ends with the round in which some player completes the 10th phase.&#10;&#10;The phases consists of sets (two or more cards with the same number showing on their face), runs (three or more cards numbered in order), cards of the same color and runs of cards of the same color. The phases are:&#10; 1. 4 pairs (sets of two cards)&#10; 2. 6 cards of the same color&#10; 3. 1 set of four cards and 1 run of four cards&#10; 4. 1 run of eight cards&#10; 5. 7 cards of the same color&#10; 6. 1 run of nine cards&#10; 7. 2 sets of four cards&#10; 8. 1 run of for cards of the same color and 1 set of three cards&#10; 9. 1 set of five cards and 1 set of three cards&#10;10. 1 set of four cards and 1 run of three cards of the same color&#10;&#10;Main differences from Phase 10:&#10;Different more challenging phases.&#10;Different sort of wild cards.&#10;More action cards.&#10;Different calculation of points.&#10;&#10;Description on the box: The long awaited game is finally here! Phase 10 with new, more demanding phases. Moreover, with over twenty action cards, which make the game even more diverse and exciting. Who will be the fastest to collect the various combinations of the same cards, or the sequence of cards? Who will be the first to master the 10 Phases? Who will be the Phase 10 Master?&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Snollygoster is a space themed card game of survival, teamwork, and a little sabotage. The goal is to escape an alien planet before the food supply runs out. Your actions are guided by a hidden agenda given to you at the beginning of the game. Pushing your agenda earns you points, but push too hard and players may turn on you. Everyone shares a potentially hazardous food supply that your awful teammates might try to sabotage. End each turn by drawing from the Event Deck in the hopes of acquiring fuel. The more fuel you have the better. Whoever has the most points at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;SETUP&#10;&#10;1) Pick a dealer. Whoever ate bacon last is a great choice. Dealer, read carefully.&#10;&#10;2) Organize the cards into decks based on the colored borders on the backs of the cards.&#10;3) Shuffle these decks and place them in the center area of play.&#10;&#10;4) Organize the Tag Cards by character. Let each player pick a character to play with or decide for them. It's up to you, almighty dealer. Players take their Tag Cards and keep them nearby.&#10;&#10;5) Deal each player one Hidden Agenda Card. These cards will determine how you play the game. Only you can look at this card. Place this card next to your tag cards so you can reference it.&#10;&#10;6) Deal everyone a hand of four cards from the Action Deck. Players can look at these cards.&#10;&#10;7) Pass the Event Deck around twice. Each player selects a Food Card from the deck, safe or unsafe, and places it in any stash. (Example: There should be 8 food on the table for a four player game)&#10;&#10;PLAYING THE GAME&#10;&#10;The player left of the dealer goes first.&#10;&#10;There are three stages in a turn: Draw, Action, and Event.&#10;&#10;1) Draw: Draw from the Action Deck until you have four cards in your hand. Don't draw if you already have four cards.(Example: If you are holding one card, then draw three)&#10;&#10;2) Action: Play as many cards as you like and/or discard as many cards as you like.&#10;&#10;3) Event: End your turn by drawing two cards from the Event Deck. Choose the one you want and place the other card on the bottom of the deck. If you chose a Fuel Card, place it next to your player tags. If you chose a Food Card place it in anyone's stash. (Don't let anyone else see this card) If you chose a Hunger Card, show it to everyone, and eat the required amount of food from your stash.&#10;&#10;Play continues clockwise around the table.&#10;&#10;Player Stash: Every player has a personal stash in front of them to store Food Cards. It holds up to three Food Cards.&#10;&#10;Using Food Cards: Hungry and Starving Cards will instruct you to use one or two Food Cards, respectively. To do so, first select a Food Card from your Player Stash and have every player acknowledge your selection. Then reveal the Food Card. If it is safe you live to see another round. If it is unsafe you are now in Quarantine. (Continue reading to learn about Quarantine) If there is a shortage of Food Cards available to you, you have died of starvation.&#10;&#10;Quarantine: If you eat a contaminated food, you are now in Quarantine. You lose all food in your stash and can no longer add any food to the table. (We can't have you contaminating everything) You continue to play as normal. You can continue to collect fuel, but you still have to eat. If you draw two food cards, you must place both in the discard pile. Unfortunately for you, you can not leave the planet while under quarantine. To get out of Quarantine, place a pair of Fuel Cards in the discard pile.&#10;&#10;Inspecting Food: During your Action Stage, play an Inspect Card. Select an untagged Food Card, privately view it, and return it face down. Place one of your Tag Cards on the Food Card as safe or unsafe. You can lie your pants off.&#10;&#10;Fuel: Fuel is required to launch the escape pod. Whoever plays a Launch Card can select goes with them, but there has to be enough total fuel between you to meet the required amount. Each player can hold up to a maximum of five fuel. Fuel is also a bargaining device. You can barter fuel with others to get yourself out of a jam. You also have the option to give a player one fuel to eat any one food from their stash. Fuel is also how you get out of Quarantine, by discarding two fuel.&#10;&#10;You Lied: If it's ever revealed you incorrectly labeled a Food Card (even a Food Card you used), you must discard your hand immediately.&#10;&#10;You Died: If a player dies by starvation, they no longer get a turn, but can still win if they accumulate enough points at the end. Their hand is placed on the Action Deck along with the discard pile and the deck is reshuffled. Without looking at the Food Cards in their Player Stash, place them on top of the Event Deck along with the discard pile, any Fuel Cards they had, and then the deck is reshuffled. Any food they tagged remains in play.&#10;&#10;Ending the Game: For the game to end, one of two things needs to happen: either a Launch Card is successfully played or everyone has died. A Launch Card can be played at any time as long as the required amount of fuel is met.&#10;&#10;Survivors get a point for each Fuel Card they contributed to the launch. Then all Hidden Agenda Cards are revealed and the points are tallied. Whoever acquired the most points wins! In the event of a tie, whoever played the Launch Card wins. If everyone died and there is still a tie, who ever died last wins.&#10;&#10;Special Cases:&#10;&#10;If you use all five of your Tag Cards, you cannot inspect anymore food until a Tag Card is returned to you.&#10;If you draw two Fuel Cards and you already have five Fuel Cards, discard both and draw again.&#10;If you draw two Food Cards and all stashes are already full, discard both and draw again.&#10;&#10;TEAM GAME RULES:&#10;&#10;If you have four or more players, you have the option to play in teams. Comrades vs Rogues. Your team affiliation will be stated on your Hidden Agenda card. You still cannot show other players your Hidden Agenda card. Your points will be added to your teams total at the end of the game and whichever team has the most points wins. The teams do not need to be of equal size.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "&quot;The Australian Wool Game&quot;&#10;&#10;In Squatter, 2 to 6 Players play as Australian sheep farmers (known colloquially as Squatters) as they work to become the most successful farmer. Each player starts with a sheep station, consisting of 5 Natural Pasture paddocks, fully stocked with 3 'pens' of sheep per paddock. Throughout the game players will earn money by buying and selling their sheep as well as from selling wool once per 'year' (circulation of the board) at the 'Wool sale' space. Players will spend this money to Improve and Irrigate their pastures. As players make their way around the board they will encounter many challenges and face the tribulations of Australian farmers including treating Foot Rot, being injured by a tractor and most devastating of all, droughts. The game ends once one player has Irrigated all of their pastures and stocked each of them with 6 pens of sheep, 30 pens in total, becoming the most successful farmer and winning the game.&#10;&#10;The game has no player elimination element and everyone stays in the game until the end.&#10;&#10;Squatter is a quintessential Australian game, becoming an icon of Australian culture and a staple in many Australian homes since it's release at the Royal Melbourne Show in 1962 on the Australian Wool Bureau stand. Squatter has sold over 500,000 copies and is the most successful board game ever developed in Australia.&#10;&#10;",

The first player who finds the corresponding card on the table becomes the next sorcerer. Some spell gestures look quite similar, so it is not uncommon to be wrong in the rush! This new sorcerer has to act out the next spell challenge while following the command on the card just found, e.g., &quot;Place the thumb of your hand holding the wand on your nose&quot;, or &quot;Wedge your wand in the crook of the elbow&quot;, or &quot;Your elbows must be glued to your body&quot;.

    "age": 9,
    "description": "HERO versus GUARDIAN: A Game of Dungeon Craft is a 2-4 player card- and dice-based strategy game that takes 45-90 minutes to play. The game has two distinct roles: the role of the Guardian who builds a dungeon and the role of the Hero who builds a party of adventurers to loot the dungeon built by the Guardian.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game the Guardian secretly designs a dungeon using a set of 16 room cards. Additional room cards are set aside and drawn from as the game progresses. There are 4 basic room types: Traps, Brutes, Evil and Magic. Brute and Evil rooms are more common and Magic and Trap rooms less common. Each room in the game is unique and has specific ways in which it can assist in the dungeon defense. For example, some rooms, like the RUST BEAST, destroy items, others, like the PRISON CELL, give the HERO player an addition adventurer if the room is captured by the HERO. In addition, there are empty rooms that when coupled with other rooms create a modifier to the chance of that room being overtaken. The Treasure Vault is the most valuable of those rooms and the goal is to keep the adventurers from finding and capturing it. Once the Guardian places entrances outside the dungeon, the game begins.&#10;&#10;Within a round, players spend tokens to take actions in an alternating sequence. The game combines elements of chance with your ability to read your opponent's strategy. The Guardian and Hero do not HAVE to take an action and can pass and wait to see what the other is doing, however, each round the Guardian has last option which means he or she can act last forcing the hero to either act, or end their turn and turn over all but 1 of their action tokens. In addition, the Hero has first option, meaning if both players wish to act first in a round, the Hero gets to go first.&#10;&#10;Each player has action tokens to spend on a variety of actions. Players use tokens to make plays during a round. After all players have spent their tokens, a new round begins with a new set of tokens.&#10;&#10;The Heroes use tokens to prepare adventurers, and move them through the dungeon. Actions include: scouting a room (a less lethal option but slower and thus can waste precious time), venturing a room (a potentially lethal action where the hero charges adventurers into a room), play a card (spell, item or adventurer), draw a card, retreat, or pass. Heroes earn points by defeating rooms. The Guardian uses action tokens to build more rooms into the dungeon, alter room locations in the dungeon, create dungeon effects to slow down the Hero's progress, or draw cards from the dungeon deck. Each card drawn brings the game closer to the end, because when the dungeon deck is emptied the game ends. The Guardian earns points by capturing adventurers and their gear, and by keeping his dungeon rooms from being captured. The game ends either when the Guardian has drawn all the dungeon cards or when the Hero captures the Treasure Vault.&#10;&#10;A major component of the game is how the Hero moves through the dungeon and captures rooms. The Hero must enter from one of the 2 entrances, and then must always move to rooms that are adjacent (not DIAGONAL) to the entrance, or adjacent to any cleared room connected to the entrance by other cleared rooms. To clear a room the Hero uses action tokens to form a party. Selecting between 1 and 4 of his adventurers with skills suited for the room at hand. The Hero can save time by charging into an unknown room or use action tokens to scout the room and then pick the best party for the job. The advantage of charging is that it saves time and throws off the Guardian, however, it can mean certain death. Scouting is safer, but eats precious time. The Hero is trying to put the best adventurers in the rooms most suited to their skills&mdash;while the Guardian tries to ambush and surprise the Hero with rooms that challenge the adventurers. This is where spells (for the Hero) and Dungeon Effects (for the Guardian) help tip the scales of a close combat. The 4 basic Adventurers WARRIOR, ROGUE, WIZARD, and CLERIC each have a room they are best at defeating. However, they are also capable and somewhat skilled in other rooms. In addition they each have a power which gives them strategic advantages, for example the warrior is better at venturing, the rogue at scouting, the wizard can cast spells without eating action points, and the cleric can save party members by sacrificing himself. Using their skills and talents at the right time in a well balanced group can mean the difference between a wipe-out and a victory. Of course, the Guardian can see the party composition and their equipment, but the Hero cannot see what is in the rooms. So the Guardian is constantly shifting and bolstering his rooms to create the most havoc for the party at hand.&#10;&#10;Equipment also scores points for the Guardian if captured, but is important to boost the adventurers skills vs. various rooms. It also takes time (action tokens) to equip. The advantage of the bonus vs. the consumption of time becomes a key strategic choice.&#10;&#10;In a multi-player game there are multiple Heroes who each take a turn in sequence against the Guardian. Each Hero builds a party of adventurers and equips them separately. In the end if the Heroes have more combined points they win as a team against the Guardian. The game currently can play 1 to 3 Heroes vs. 1 Guardian.&#10;&#10;",

If any player thinks they have got it, they slam their hand on the table. One can also slam the table to bluff other players into thinking they have the solution. After three players have slammed their hands, the remaining player must choose one of the three players to give the solution. If the chosen player answers correctly, the remaining player takes the four cards and put them at the bottom of his draw deck. If the chosen player has no solution or answers wrongly, he/she must take the four cards and put them at the bottom of his/her draw deck. Game ends when one player exhausts his/her draw deck. If no player can think up a solution (some card combinations cannot form 24), they can all agree to put back their respective cards, reshuffle, and draw a new card from their draw deck.
