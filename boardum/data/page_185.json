That's why we turned 180 of them into playing cards!&#10;&#10;Two styles of play (&quot;Clich&eacute; Bingo&quot; and &quot;Name the Movies&quot;) are the meat of the game - but you can surely come up with different scenarios.&#10;&#10;As Action and Horror are the most clich&eacute;-filled genres, most cards fall into these categories. Therefore Action and Horror are also available as Standalone editions, whereas Comedy and SciFi &amp; Fantasy are only available in this Complete Edition.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

In the game you have a 3x3 grid of number cards and around it you have face cards. The face cards are called royals and the goal of the game is to assassinate all 12 of them. If you manage to do this you win the game. Number cards may only be played on matching or lower numbers. In order to kill a royal, you place a card opposite him/her - which means you have lit the charge on a cannon - and you use the two cards between the trigger and the royal, the &quot;payload&quot;, to do that much damage. Payloads can include any suits when attacking jacks, but must match the color of any queens attacked and the suit of attacked kings. Aces and jokers provide you with special actions.&#10;&#10;",

Every player id dealt 10 commodity cards which change the price up or down of one or more of the commodities.  Every player starts with $10,000 and the winner is the player who has the most money after everyone has played all ten of their cards.&#10;&#10;On a players turn they can: 1 - enter or close out a contract (going either long - betting the price will go up; or short - betting the price will go down; 2-  play a price movement card; 3 - roll the dice (usually either resulting in a commodity price movement or an action card draw (random event)).&#10;&#10;The nature of the futures market is that you take positions based on whether you believe a commodity price will go up or down.  If you think the price will rise, you buy or go 'long' of the commodity hoping that by the time the contract matures, you can sell them back at a profit. Conversely, if your hunch (or information) is that prices will fall, you sell or go 'short' thinking you can close out the deal at a lower price, again making money. So the logic is that whatever way the market moves, you can make profits - if you are right.    The one thing that this game does is give each person at least one chance to sell a contract at any time - not just on your turn - so if you think it is the perfect time - you can interrupt another player's turn to sell to lock in your profits.&#10;&#10;The game is over after everyone plays their last card - and no new contracts can be started during the last round (1 card left).  There is still quite a bit of luck in the game,  with wild swings possible in some commodity prices, but you start with all the cards you will have and therefore have a good bit of information about some price swing possibilities - all you need is some help and a bit of help from the random events.&#10;&#10;",

On 22 June, more than 2,000,000 Soviet soldiers stormed the heavily fortified lines of the badly outnumbered German Army Group Centre. The German defences quickly crumbled under several sledgehammer blows. German armoured reserves rushed forward, desperately counterattacking to stem the on-rushing Red tide in the climactic Battle of Minsk.&#10;&#10;Firestorm Campaign&#10;In Firestorm&mdash;Bagration, you command the Soviet or German forces fighting for Byelorussia in the critical months of June and July 1944. &#10;Put yourself in command on the Eastern Front using your Flames Of War historical miniatures on the table&shy;top.

Use these rules to succeed in the new River Crossing Mission and the Crossing the Drut scenario, both found within.

    "description": "How would you feel if &quot;You find out that you have the oppportunity not to age&quot; ? Would you be excited? Scared? Mistrustful ? Most importantly, how would the others feel? Feelinks makes you share your emotions, flex your empathy and discover the people around you!&#10;&#10;With this second edition of the game, Feelinks can now be played from 2 players, with a gameplay that has been simplified in order to better serve the core of the game. &#10;Furthermore, Feelinks is now completely cooperative and gets new artworks featuring genderfree animals. &#10;Last but not least, this second edition comes with a new deck of Situations cards, &quot;In Society&quot;. This category covers 6 sub-themes (Health, Parenthood, Living Together, Digital World, Ecology and Education) to be played with your family, your friends but also as a tool if you're woriking with children or teenagers.&#10;&#10;Feelinks is a game of emotions. When playing, you:&#10;&#10;1) Pick a card and chose a situation to read.&#10;2) Secretly choose the emotion that matches how you feel.&#10;3) Starting with the active player, you guess which emotion has been chosen by another player, who will in turn do the same until all emotions have been revealed.&#10;&#10;The empathy track will tell how well you know your friends and family. It's more than a game: Feelinks is a journey towards a better understanding of yourself and others through funny, serious or suprising situations.&#10;&#10;&quot;Feelings&quot;, the original title of the game, won the call for projects launched by the city of Poitiers in the fight against discrimination. The goal was the creation of a simple, easily playable game that relies on situations or questions around discrimination. Jean-Louis Roubira, one of the designers, previously developed the famous Dixit workshops of language with young people at risk.&#10;&#10;In the game, our preconceptions are challenged. Feelinks contains 156 cards offering 468 situations from everyday life. For example: &quot;You have telepathic powers&quot; or &quot;Your sister hacked a government computer&quot;. The players are invited to think about how they would feel in a given situation and to guess the feeling of another player in the same situation.&#10;&#10;This empathy for each player is conducive to the debate and to challenges of our preconceptions. Feelinks encourages you to express what you feel and to put yourself in somebody else's shoes.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Cheesonomics is a cheesy original card game for 2-5 players ages 8 and up that takes about 20-30 minutes to play.  It is a strategic set collecting, memory-based, hand management card game based on controlling and manipulating the supply and demand of various types of cheese from cheese markets throughout North America or Europe.&#10;&#10;The European edition of Cheesonomics features cheese from France, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands and Scandinavia.  The North American edition of Cheesonomics features cheese from Wisconsin, California, New York, Oregon and Canada.&#10;&#10;The overall goal of Cheesonomics is to manage your cheese supply, churn the right colors or animal types from your opponents' hands, produce the market's most demanded colors of cheese to milk the most profit, and earn the most curd cash by selling different colors of cheese at high market prices.&#10;&#10;Cheesonomics can be played at three different skill levels - mild, sharp and extra sharp - allowing gamers to adjust the game according to their own playing palate.&#10;&#10;Each game starts with three market wheels made up of 5 market wedges, and each player receives five cheese wedges and a cheese knife marked with either cheddar, edam, feta, gouda or parmesan.&#10;&#10;On each turn, the active player begins by retrieving his cheese knife from the serving tray - if it was placed there on a previous turn - and then chooses one of three different culinary actions: Churn Cheese, Produce Cheese or Sell Cheese.&#10;&#10;Churning cheese allows a player to collect cheese wedges from opponents. When churning, the active player asks for one color or animal type. The colors are red, orange, yellow, green or blue, and animals are cow, sheep, goat, yak, and reindeer. If an opponent has that type of cheese card, he must give the active player one card of that type. If he does not have that card type, the opponent must show his hand and give the active player one wedge of the active player's choice.&#10;&#10;The active player then protects his product by placing his cheese knife over that color or animal type on the provided serving tray. No other player can churn for that type of cheese until the knife is removed on that player's next turn.&#10;&#10;Instead of Churning, a player could Produce cheese.  To do this, the active player simply plays all cheese wedges of one color or animal type from his hand face up onto the table into a cheese wheel. These wedges will be available for sale in future turns. The player then draws cheese wedges until he has five total wedges in his hand.&#10;&#10;Instead of Churning or Producing cheese, the active player could Sell Cheese. To sell, a player chooses up to three wedges of one color or animal type from previously-formed cheese and gains curd cash depending on the market, which is the sum of face-up, matching color market wedges.&#10;&#10;After selling cheese, the active player now &quot;Mooves&quot; the market, choosing one market wedge representing the color of the cheese sold in the transaction and flipping that wedge to the opposite side.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the cheese wedge draw pile is exhausted during a player's turn. The cheesemonger who has the most curd cash is the cheesy champion!&#10;&#10;Cheesonomics has even more to offer players who wish to try out the Sharp and Extra Sharp flavors of the game.&#10;&#10;In the Sharp game, players can now further manipulate the market. Whenever a Sell Cheese action is taken, that player now also chooses a wedge in the market to completely replace with one from his personal supply of market wedges.&#10;&#10;There are also certain cheese wedges with market symbols that may be activated during a Sell Cheese action that can allow a player to discard one of their market wedges and gain another or give a market wedge to one of the other players and take one of theirs.&#10;&#10;The Extra Sharp game is for the truly adventurous Cheeseheads!  As an expansion to Cheesonomics, players can add in the Extra Sharp cheese wedge cards that introduce growth hormone, organic and smelly cheese wedges. Each of these new cheese wedge types have special rules that affect a Sell Cheese action, allowing players the choice to boost their production with growth hormones, earn more curds at game end with quality organic cheeses, or use pungent aromas to prevent players from flipping or removing market wedges.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Medieval Battle is a model battle game, with two players each commanding an army of knights. Players start by building a battlefield, recruiting knights to their army, then deploying them. Players act in turn to maneuver their knights on the battlefield, and the combat potential for each type of troop differs, with heavy armored units moving more slowly and fighting better than lighter units. Pikemen can stop cavalry, while archers and longbowmen want to keep enemy units below them and light cavalry are ideal for chasing archers on horseback. The unique system of combat results has no randomness.&#10;&#10;Players look for advantages and opportunities, attacking the enemy when it's too tired to run, for example, or claiming good terrain position. By using the power and mobility of his forces, a player tries to control more strategic points than his opponent and thereby win the game.&#10;&#10;",

The mixing of the streams and the shape of the ocean bottom lifts nutrients to the surface, helping to create one of the richest fishing grounds in the world &ndash; but it is also the cause of violent storms that happen in the best fishing zone of this area: the well-known Flemish Cap of The Perfect Storm.&#10;&#10;The players will have to manage their victory points when they are on the coast to hire boats, engage captains and crews, and buy the proper quantities of fuel and bait so as to sail the Ocean at their best and fish the heaviest and most profitable swordfish of the world.&#10;&#10;Only the most skilled and bravest seamen will be able to take to the open sea without fear through the storm, find the &quot;triple markers&quot;, and sell the catch in order to have the most victory points at the end of the season.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Anzio Beachhead is an operational level simulation game of the allied invasion of the Italian mainland near Rome during WWII. The invasion began January 22, 1944, under the code name Operation Shingle. It had the Alban Hills and the isolation of the German army as its objective. Failing in this, Allied troops would have to hold until relieved. Here Hitler recognized Germany's great chance to destroy an Allied invasion. Had his troops succeeded in destroying the beachhead, the war in Europe could well have been lengthened.&#10;&#10;Anzio Beachhead is a two-player game in which one player controls the German forces while his opponent controls the Allied forces.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Turn: 24 Hours&#10;Hex: .9 mile / 1.34 km&#10;Unit: Company/Battalion/Regiment/Brigade&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 17&quot; x 22&quot; Map&#10;One counter sheet (100 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 8 page rule booklet&#10;&#10;This first appeared in Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #20 in December 1969, along with Bastogne. SPI later released it in white box and black formats during the 1970s. In 1990 it reappeared, with minor revision, in S&amp;T #134 (May/June 1990).&#10;&#10;Per Jim Dunnigan:&#10;&#10;&quot;AB was seen as another situation like the Bulge, where the attacker had a rapidly declining edge. The original American commander was not bold, and lost. So the idea with AB was to explore the what if's. At that time, I had been working on designing games for about eight years (since I first discovered the AH games.) Before that, I was always interested in the details of history, and how they were connected. AH wargames were the first time I saw someone else thinking the same way, and doing it in a novel way.  I was always building on that.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I had been designing a similar game, called Italy, which incorporated the rest of the Italian theater, with a smaller scale map of the Anzio area (ie, two interrelated games, one strategic and the other operational). But when Dave's game came in I thought it did a better job of the Anzio section. We had come up with some of the same solutions, and his game  was more compact and suitable for the magazine.&quot;&#10;&#10;(e-mails with Neopeius, 9/5-6/11)&#10;&#10;",

Play continues in this way, with each player drawing a new piece on their board, until no one can place another piece.  Then the player who has the fewest unfilled spaces on their board wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "A 2 player abstract game using a board made from separate square tiles, with channels at right angles to control movement, on both sides of each tile. Players must get 4 of their 5 pieces across the board and can rotate a tile 90 degrees each turn. The trick in the game is that you can move on the paths over the tiles, then move on the paths underneath the tiles, then move again on the surface.&#10;&#10;There are two kinds of tile. One tile has the right angle paths in the same place on both sides. The other tile has them on different places on each side. This works because you can tell by the markings which paths are on the underside without having to look. The board is set up randomly in a 5x7 grid.&#10;&#10;When travelling underneath, you must travelling under at least one stone on the surface, of either player. If you do go under an opponent's stone, you are allowed a further tile rotation at the end of your move (a key bonus that gives you an edge). You are not allowed to move a tile that your opponent just turned, but otherwise you can rotate any tile at all.&#10;&#10;The new edition by Abacus is in card, with little wood posts to help lift and turn the tiles. The first edition is a nice wooden edition, part of a range of games by the firm Clemens Gerhards.&#10;&#10;Moguli seems like a brain-burner at first, but quickly the possibilities become obvious, and as only a few tiles move, you can read the paths on both sides very easily. You move from trying to figure the board, to trying to figure your opponent's options and how to exploit them. Moguli is a very interesting abstract that seems gimmicky at first, but soon becomes a clever challenge and very entertaining.&#10;&#10;",

Now you can enjoy the beauty of Goa in this roll-and-write game.&#10;&#10;In Go Goa, you have twelve days to tour the state, collecting souvenirs from different tourist destinations. On each day, you select three dice to decide the direction, distance, and deviation in the route that you will travel, then trace a route to your new destination.&#10;&#10;In more detail, during each round the starting player rolls three dice, then reserves one die for the direction that only they can use. All other players use the dice to determine the direction to travel in, the number of steps, and the deviations they are allowed to take. Players then draw the route that they are taking for the day on their player sheet, which represents the map of Goa. The map contains tourist destinations, and if you end your movement on such a spot, you score points.&#10;&#10;You also score bonus points for completing sets of five different destination types or three of one particular destination. In addition, you can score points for completing the tour plans that you chose.&#10;&#10;After all players take their turn, a new round starts, with the starting player role moving clockwise.&#10;&#10;The game ends after twelve rounds are completed.

    "description": "Fano330-R-Morris is a ruthless game, in that you can never win on your turn, but you can lose.&#10;&#10;The &ldquo;Fano&rdquo; portion of the name comes from the board, which depicts the Fano plane. The Fano plane is a finite projective plane with the minimum number of points and lines possible: 7 points and 7 lines (counting the circle), with 3 points on each line, and 3 lines through every point.&#10;The &ldquo;330&rdquo; portion of the name comes from the original playing pieces for the game: &yen;330 of Japanese coins: Player 1 would use two &yen;100 coins and two &yen;50 coins, while Player 2 would use two &yen;10 coins and two &yen;5 coins.&#10;&#10;For the nestorgames edition, each player has pieces of one color: two circles and two triangles, in celebration of the geometry depicted in the Fano plane.&#10;&#10;How To Play&#10;&#10;The board starts empty. White plays first.&#10;&#10;Placement Phase&#10;&#10;Players take turns stacking one of their pieces on the circled spaces of the board, following The Stacking Rules below:&#10;&#10;A) Stack it on an empty space or&hellip;&#10;B) Stack it on another piece already on the board, applying The Stacking Rules as follow:&#10;a. No more than 2 pieces can be stacked on the same space. A stack consists of one or two pieces.&#10;b. Two pieces of identical shape and colour cannot be stacked.&#10;&#10;Movement Phase&#10;&#10;When the Placement Phase finishes, players take turns moving one of their pieces on the board, following the rules below:&#10;A) Move it to an adjacent space along a &ldquo;line&rdquo; (See the section &quot;LINES&quot;), following The Stacking Rules.&#10;B) When two pieces are stacked, only the upper piece can be moved.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you must move one of your topmost pieces from a stack along a line to an adjacent space, respecting the Stacking Rule.&#10;&#10;LINES&#10;&#10;The &ldquo;lines&rdquo; are defined as the 7 lines that connect thefollowing 3-space sets on the board:&#10;{1,2,4}, {5,2,3}, {3,4,6}, {6,1,5}, {2,7,6}, {4,7,5}, {1,7,3}&#10;&#10;Game End&#10;&#10;You lose if either of the following is true:&#10;a) 3 pieces of the same colour or same shape are in a &ldquo;line&rdquo; (remember, the circle is a &ldquo;line&rdquo;) when finishing your turn. Only consider the topmost piece in each space. (Placement or Movement Phase)&#10;b) You have no legal moves when starting your turn. (Movement Phase)&#10;&#10;Notice that the game might end during the Placement Phase.&#10;&#10;In case of repeated board positions, the game ends in a draw. Play again swapping colours.&#10;&#10;",

Some characters want to fall in hopelessly in love but others are more pragmatic - or just plain mercenary!&#10;&#10;You'll discover your characters&rsquo; motives with the roll of a dice. Each character has a preference which makes them more likely to prefer a particular &lsquo;trait&rsquo; - Charm, Virtue, Rank or Fortune.&#10;&#10;Making a suitable match &ndash; for example marrying one of your gold-diggers to a rich suitor &ndash; will earn you more prestige. The player who earns the most prestige wins the game. &#10;You can gain even more prestige by earning the approval of patrons. Mrs Norris only approves of people with a good fortune whereas Lady Bertram is more impressed by charm.&#10;&#10;In addition to making matches, you can invite characters to prestigious residences to boost your prestige still further. Make sure you invite the right sort of guest, they don't approve of riffraff at Mansfield Park!&#10;&#10;The original Matchmaker card game was intended for social play (3 or more players) but I received many requests for a 2-player variant. Jane Austen's Matchmaker: Chapter 2 was designed with this in mind.&#10;&#10;Whether you play head to head or with up to three other players, you must assess each proposal and your chances of coming out on top, before you accept or decline.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Order of Arms is a simulation game of battles from Medieval &amp; Renaissance times; from Hastings in 1066, to Pavia in 1525, a period that featured the mounted armored knight before the rise of wide spread professional infantry armies. Players take the role of the Field Commander of an army of the period, attempting to fulfill victory conditions using mounted and foot arms of the period.&#10;&#10;Players use arms of the period including men-at-arms, both mounted and dismounted, infantry including archers, and when available, early firearms.&#10;&#10;Order of Arms is descended from and related to the 3rd edition of the grand tactical Napoleonic game Eagles of the Empire. Players familiar with that game will recognize many features of that system present here in Order of Arms. However (and this is a BIG however), there are significant differences between Eagles of the Empire and Order of Arms; most notably the scale at which Order of Arms portrays its combat, and the resulting procedures that emphasize unit to unit fighting. Moreover, where the queen of the battlefield in Napoleon's time was the linear Infantry formation, in Order of Arms, the dominant unit up until near the very end of the period covered, was the Mounted Men-at-Arms (MMA); the armored knight; the result of which is that the long playing piece in Order of Arms is the MMA unit.&#10;&#10;Fornovo 1495, the first game in the series presents the battle fought between the French Army of King Charles VIII, and the Condottieri forces of the League of Venice under the command of Francesco II Gonzaga of Mantua. The game features the Historical Battle as fought by Francesco Gonzaga across a rising Taro River, a free-set up version, and a what-if scenario that portrays the Italian fear of a French drive on Parma.&#10;&#10;Complexity: 5 out of 10&#10;Solitaire Suitability: 7 out of 10&#10;&#10;Time Scale: 20 minutes per turn&#10;Map Scale: 350 yards per area&#10;Unit Scale: Battalions and Companies&#10;&#10;Players: 1 to 2&#10;Playing Time: 2 to 4 hours&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;1 Series rulebook&#10;1 Game specific rulebook/scenario book&#10;1 Map 22&rdquo; x 34&rdquo;&#10;2 Countersheets with both long and square counters&#10;Multiple charts and tables cards&#10;3 Six-sided Dice&#10;1 Box and Lid&#10;&#10;(source: Compass Games website and user's description)&#10;&#10;",

The cards have illustrations of pigs (naturally), and you can be &quot;hog tied&quot; or have a &quot;hog wash&quot;.&#10;&#10;Players start with three face-down cards (called &quot;Slop&quot;) and a hand of six cards. At the start you place three of your cards face-up on top of the slop cards, leaving you with a hand of three cards. Each turn you must play to the central &quot;Pig Pile&quot; one or more cards of the same value that are equal to or greater than the top card of the Pig Pile. If you fail to do so, you must take the entire Pig Pile into your hand. Certain cards have special effects:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Hog Wild: Wild card that can be played at any time and allows any card to played on it next turn.&#10;    Hog Tied (4s): The next player loses his turn.&#10;    Hog Wash (8s): Remove the Pig Pile from the game and take another turn. (If three cards of the same value are played in succession, a Hog Wash takes place automatically.)&#10;    Ewe Turn (11s): Reverse order of play.&#10;&#10;&#10;Each turn you draw back to three cards until the deck runs out. If you have no cards in hand (which can happen only after the deck runs out), you must play a face-up card (a card that you laid aside at start) or if those are gone, a slop card. (Slop cards are played blind, so you could be really screwed.) If you're the first or second player to rid yourself of cards (including your slop), you receive a number of pigs. Whoever has the most pigs after five hands wins.&#10;&#10;",

Gameplay begins by turning over the first far left card. Read the card's scenario and follow its instructions, before moving to the next card. Cards contain encounters such as monster combat, weapon and health upgrades, penalties, and more. After making your way to the far right,  reshuffle the cards and lay them out again. Start again at the far left card and make your way to the right. Repeat this sequence three times before facing one of the end game boss cards. Defeating one of the three boss cards gives you either fortune, fame or glory.&#10;&#10;The final goal of the game is to survive 3-9 rounds.

    "description": "Cego, Zego or Ceco (from lat.caecus = blind) is a traditional German card game, for 3 or 4 players, played primarily in the Black Forest. Hardly a farm house which has no cego deck. The game is played mainly throughout the winter, when there is little work to do in the fields and few daylight hours.&#10;&#10;A Cego deck consists of 54 cards: 22 &quot;Truck&quot;, that means trump cards, 16 &quot;Bilder&quot; or picture cards, king, queen, knight and jack in the 4 suits. and 16 &quot;Leere&quot; or empty cards, also in the 4 suits.&#10;The 22 trumps are numbered from 1 to 21, and a single picture card without suit, which would be #22, the highest trump, commonly called &quot;Gsties&quot;, sometimes &quot;Sk&uuml;s&quot; from ital. &quot;scusa&quot; = sorry (for taking the trick).&#10;&#10;The game is basically a trick tacking game, you've got to follow suit, if not available you have to trump.&#10;&#10;Usually one player will play against the other three, the player following the dealer will have to play if no one bids for the play.&#10;&#10;Cards are dealt 11 to each player and 10 face down in the middle (the Cego or blind cards). These 10 cards will go to the highest bidder, depending on his bid either remaining face down or he discards 9 or 10 cards from his hand and takes up the Cego cards. A simple play would be a bid for Cego, discarding 9 cards from your hand, taking up 10 cards, then choosing one additional card for your pile and starting play.&#10;&#10;This is the interesting and unusual part of this game. Your decision to bid depends on the cards which you will not have available for the coming game, but you will get to play with mainly unknown cards. Therefore the title &quot;Blind&quot;.&#10;&#10;There are a lot of other options, available for every player or only the bidder, for example:&#10;-Solo play: when you have lots of trump in your initial play, no cards are discarded.&#10;-R&auml;uber, rubber: when no one bids, every player on his own, you try to have fewest points.&#10;-Bettel: the bidder tries to get no cards.&#10;-Piccolo: the bidder tries to make exactly one trick.&#10;&#10;Scoring is done by counting out your points, only three trumps (Gstiess, 21 and 1) and all the pictures count.&#10;Points and counting method differ, but the bidder always need the majority of points, every 5 points over or under mean an additional factor.&#10;&#10;",

Two of your landscapes point left, the other two right. Each team has 40 hit points, and to win you need to bring the opponents down to zero. Gameplay is identical to the 1v1 version of Adventure Time Card Wars, but now you need to guard against attack from two opponents while trying to help out your partner when needed.&#10;&#10;One special addition to this set is Teamwork cards, which don't occupy a lane. Each player can control one, and these cards give you and your partner a benefit turn after turn...if you play your cards right.&#10;&#10;",

For example, the snippet IPP can be found in the words SNIPPETS, QUIPPED, and HIPPIE but not in SHIPSHAPE, PIPE, or HOPPING.&#10;&#10;Players have 60 seconds to write down as many words as they can think of that contain each round's snippet. Anything goes! Dictionary words, people names, place names, brand names, fictional things, technical terms, slang, acronyms, abbreviations, contractions, hyphenations, non-english words, the snippet itself, and even plurals and alternate verb tenses are all allowed!&#10;&#10;When time's up, players compare answers, earning points for unique words and fun bonuses. The player with the most points wins the round and the first to 3 rounds wins the game!&#10;&#10;With its unique &quot;anything goes&quot; rule, Snippets isn't like most word games, requiring more of a creative mind than a large vocabulary. And with only 60 seconds to think, everyone&rsquo;s answers will be equally hilarious.&#10;&#10;",

This is definitely a matter of taste - and that's why the typical ideals of beauty don't count in this modeling competition - instead, they're ones that young players love. But before the children's creations can parade before the jury down the runway on the living room table, the fantastical creations must first be created over several game rounds. The requirements are set out on cards that define certain features. Little creators who do a particularly good job can collect extra points and increase the chances that their monster will be crowned &quot;Miss Monster&quot;.&#10;&#10;",

Then you must tell a story about how you will use this implausible but fearsome weapon to destroy your opponent. The other player gets to build a defensive item in the same way (maybe a &quot;radioactive garden gnome&quot;) and describe how it prevents or deflects the attack. The rest of the group then decides who is the winner of the battle.&#10;&#10;In 2006, an expansion was released called Stupiduel Fantasy Expansion.&#10;&#10;Expanded by&#10;&#10;    Stupiduel Fantasy Expansion&#10;    Stupiduel: Modifiers & Tricks Expansion&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Have you ever looked up in the sky at all the stars, at the marvel of the Universe and felt a curious nerve inside wanting to travel to these stars, see the planets, and maybe find life? Expedition Zetta includes 3D-models of spaceships, gorgeous art, and a modular game system. In this game for 1-5 players, you and your fellow travelers each represent a country in a maiden voyage of the first starship to ever use a newly developed warp drive. The goal is to brave the unknown and collect discoveries in four different star systems. Though you may have to cooperate, one player will bring special fame and fortune to their home country. Will it be you?&#10;&#10;In Expedition Zetta, you start the game by recruiting 1-4 crew members, then you will:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Discover strange planetary systems, randomly generated each game based on the latest scientific data&#10;    Find exotic new substances never before seen&#10;    Develop exo-products that can advance human technology&#10;    Gain new knowledge&#10;    Encounter new forms of life or ruins and settlements of vanished, ancient alien civilizations with their promise of both danger and discovery&#10;    Perhaps encounter another star-faring civilization whose members might even become part of your crew, making it not only international but interstellar&#10;    See crew interactions that can lead to romance or intrigue, which can either help or hinder you&#10;&#10;&#10;Every game plays differently! Each game includes four planetary systems. After warping together to a distant star, you travel with your crew individually between planets, searching for life and substances or trying to construct exo-products. If the life you find is intelligent, you may even interact with it. The discoveries are your main source of Fame.&#10;&#10;The revolutionary Zetta Planetary System Generator, used in the advanced game, can generate as many different star systems in the game as there are in the known universe, each with its own unique characteristics and its own name. Thus, no two voyages to the stars will ever be the same! During the warp stage in the advanced game, you interact with the other players' crew members to gain advantages. Romance or intrigue may occur, with varying effects.&#10;&#10;Apart from the gameplay experience, a journey with Expedition Zetta will give you knowledge about stars and planets, along with memories of when you for instance managed to extract gems from a gaseous giant in a triple star system, from when you found life in a lenticular galaxy or when you managed to produce time crystals near a super-hot supergiant O-star.&#10;&#10;Expedition Zetta has a basic version that is great for the whole family.&#10;&#10;    Want a quick game? Use the Quick rules!&#10;    Want to add special adventures and encounters to your mission? Play adding one or several of the specialized rule modules!&#10;    Want to play solo? There are two different solitaire variants.&#10;    Playing for the first time? Use the play-and-learn tutorial.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Not to be Confused With: Chainmail&#10;&#10;The game uses cards, one deck for each player (whose cards are somewhat different from those of the other player) to drive the game. Each player gets a certain number of cards each turn - but never his full deck. The cards are used to determine movement, combat, and actions such as Axemen, Knights Charge, Chivalry Charge, and Strategic Movement, among others. Players may play each card for only one of the possible three purposes.&#10;&#10;CHAINMAIL is thus a game of card play and management, which unfolds on the historical battle map - it uses squares, rather than hexes &ndash; with the use of some beautiful, super-size counters. This is a game of position, feint, and sudden attack with what you hope are better odds (since you don&rsquo;t know what cards your opponent will play, if any, and you never know what his final strength will be). No dice are used. And there are no CRT&rsquo;s. Skill determines the outcome.&#10;&#10;The game thus becomes a tense battle. When do you play your cards? How many do you play? What do you do with them? Will you be caught short and be subject to a sudden attack by your opponent?&#10;CHAINMAIL includes four of the major battles of the Medieval period: Legnano (1176), Bouvines (1214), Lewes (1264), and Bannockburn (1314).&#10;&#10;LEGNANO&#10;The Battle of Legnano, May 29, 1176, was a major defeat of the Holy Roman Emperor Barbarossa by members of the Lombard League. It was a major setback to his plans for imperial domination of Italy and showed for the first time of infantry against feudal cavalry.&#10;&#10;BOUVINES&#10;The Battle of Bouvines, July 27, 1214, was a conclusive medieval battle ending the twelve year old War of Bouvines that was important to the early development of both the French state by confirming the French crown&rsquo;s sovereignty over the Norman lands of Brittany and Normandy.&#10;&#10;LEWES&#10;The Battle of Lewes, May 12, 1264, was a one of two main battles of the conflict known as the Second Barons' War. It was the high point of the career of Simon De Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester and made him the &quot;uncrowned King of England&quot;.&#10;&#10;BANNOCKBURN&#10;The Battle of Bannockburn, 24 June 1314, was a significant Scottish victory in the Wars of Scottish Independence.

The player purposefully conducts the affairs of the Russian Empire and its allies, while the game system does the same for the anti-Russian coalition made up of a shifting alliance of powers.&#10;&#10;Central to play of the game are its 'policy cards.' They trigger various strategies, powers at war, and other events that shape the general course of play. Policy cards are activated in one of two ways: the Empire player can choose which policies he will activate, while coalition policies are activated by the draw of markers. The Empire player may move his forces freely. The game system moves coalition forces according to a schedule of precedence.&#10;&#10;The objective of the game is for the Russian Empire to have gained an advantageous position at the end of play, measured in terms of gaining certain objectives. The player must, however, also look toward maintaining the &quot;balance of power,&quot; or he may face disintegration of the entire European state system. Depending on how well the player attains his objectives, then, will really be the thing that determines the nature of victory.&#10;&#10;While Catherine the Great has been purpose-designed to be a solitaire game, more than one can play at the same time as part of a Russian Empire command team. Players can divvy up responsibilities as they please for different parts of the Russian Empire, with the most veteran gamer taking the role of Czar and deciding who gets what resources.  Each region represents a distinct geographic area or province within a power. Each unit represents an entire army or fleet. Each turn represents five years.&#10;&#10;",

Relationships &ndash; that is, defined relations between two races of aliens &ndash; are connected to the game actions of the players. Players use these relationships to occupy planets and have a majority there. Relationships are: Love (born new alien - Bastard), Hungry (eat enemy alien bastard - enemy is removed from the planet), War (shot enemy alien bastard which dead body will fill the planet), Trade, Friendship, Migration (traveling by spaceship), Mutation (transform to a different alien) and Political propaganda (changing the relationships).&#10;&#10;Space Bastards is a game in which you can enjoy and observe the picturesque aliens as small animals in an aquarium &ndash; while siccing them on your opponents, of course...&#10;&#10;",

(Note: there even exists a version with number cards: What's That on My Head?) &#10;On your turn you ask a question aloud and then answer it.  The questions involve the letters you can see on your opponent's heads, like sums, odds vs. evens, etc.  The questions on each card are ranked in difficulty so you can vary the difficulty depending on the participants.&#10;&#10;Using the answers to the question you race to deduce your letter.  If you get it wrong you keep the three letters, but lose 4 points.  If you get it right you get 10 points and 3 new letters on your head.

This was also sold in 'Folio' form in case some folks just wanted specific games covering their 'favorite' battle(s).&#10;&#10;The components consist of the following: a 'Standard' Rules fold-out 'sheet' (about 3-Full pages) for the game series; an 'Exclusive' Rules sheet(1-page); a 4-COLOR paper Mapsheet-(17&quot; by 22&quot;); a set of cardboard counters (one hundred); and players must provide their OWN 6-sided DIE prior to play.&#10;&#10;On the Mapsheet are the Turn Record Track, a Terrain Key, and the set-up locations for the Units of both the 'Campaign' &amp; 'Sidi Rezegh' games. Overall, the COLOR of the Mapsheet is WHITE with BLUE (Water/Sea, Allied 'Fortified Box', Minefield Hex-sides), BROWN- (Rough), Light GRAY- (Broken), &amp; Dark BROWN- (Roads, Trails). The Area encompassed by this Mapsheet is from the coast around 'Halfaya Pass' south to Ft.Madellena over to far South of Bir Hacheim upto West of Tobruk past Monument. &#10; The game counters are TAN-with BLACK print for Germans, TAN-with GREEN print for Italians, GREEN with BLACK print for British, &amp; assorted Allied Units. Game scale is given as  1.7 Miles across each hex, each Turn represents 1-Day, and Units range in size from Battalion up to Brigade level.&#10;&#10;There are 3-Scenarios included on the 1-page 'Exclusive' Rules Sheet: the full Campaign game~20 Turns; Sidi Rezegh~6-Turns (1~6); &amp; The Dash to the Wire~5-1/2-Turns (7~12, the British player skip their 1st Turn). The Exclusive Rules set out Supply Sources, detail the Tobruk Defenses, explain a British 'Diversion' attempt starting on Turn 6, and Victory Conditions for each Scenario. The Standard Rules has the Combat Results Table on the last 'inside' page. There are some 'interesting' location placenames such as 'Beer Bottle Hill', 'Hellfire Pass', 'Trafalgar Square', 'Libyan Omar', 'the Wire', and others of unique 'flavor'.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Crusader: Battle for Tobruk&#10;&#10;&#10;",
