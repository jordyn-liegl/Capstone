    "description": "Enter Rome at the time of the slave uprisings under Spartacus! The escaped rebels have managed to gain influence and power.  Rome is attempting to undermine the stronger armies of the slaves in order to restore &quot;pax&quot;, or peace &ndash; but only for personal gain.&#10;&#10;Will the Empire collapse under the strain, or will their promises to insurgents succeed in drawing them to their side?&#10;&#10;The players play the part of the escaped slaves who try to increase their sphere of influence and undermine the Roman establishment. Using their cards, they expand their power in seven different categories. At the end of the game, each player tries to be stronger than Rome - and, of course, stronger than any opponent. Through intrigue, however, a player can join forces with Rome and thus contribute to its victory over the slave revolt.&#10;&#10;PAX is a multi-faceted game of card management and influence in which each card requires a tricky tactical decision. With two copies of the game, up to eight players can compete for a foothold in the Roman Empire.&#10;&#10;",

The rondels provide another tactical layer, including the enemy's devious and challenging AI.&#10;&#10;The rules allow you to learn to play in 15 minutes, with a typical game round lasting less than ten minutes, even with up to six players, but deep, strategic cooperation will be required for your band of heroes to make it through to the Abyssal Rift and maybe even come out alive.&#10;&#10;Perdition&rsquo;s Mouth is designed to be played as a story-supported campaign over several gaming sessions. In the campaign, you have to fight through at least six increasingly challenging scenarios and the level of success during each adventure has a direct effect on the rest of the story. Can you survive the labyrinth of the insectoid god?&#10;&#10;",

Balance endgame scoring goal needs with immediate tactical needs to create a mighty civilization replete with wonders of the world.&#10;&#10;Each turn, you have four available cards to place. Some of them will be districts, the basic building blocks of civilization, while others will be wonders, powerful but costly constructions. Wonder cards feature one block and a wonder; wonders are worth a large number of points and offer potent effects, but require significant resources to construct and cannot be covered by further cards.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you pick one of these cards and place it in your realm. Cards can be placed next to, overlapping, or entirely covering one or more cards in your realm. When a block (or multiple blocks) is covered by a new card, those blocks can be activated to gain their effect. Mines fill your coffers with valuable gold; with gold, you can activate production sites and citizens. Citizens come in two types and might affect other cards, such as the value of certain wonders.&#10;&#10;On the back of each district card is an event that impacts the growth of your civilization, and the event on the top of the district deck is active for the round.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, score your wonders and mines as well as any remaining gold and resources to determine how your civilization stacks up.&#10;&#10;",

Whichever team first places all eight of its tokens in the target area wins.&#10;&#10;The first twist in Dog is that play is based on a hand of cards held by each player, with the start player and the quantity of cards cycling on successive hands from six cards to two, then resetting to five, then progressing back to two. Card values range from 1-13, with a number of special actions represented.&#10;&#10;The second twist is that Dog is a partnership game, with the players winning or losing as a team, which adds a significant level of strategy and tactics to the game. Partners trade one card at the beginning of each round, and once one player from a partnership has completed his group, his plays now assist his partner.&#10;&#10;Compact Dog is a travel version of Dog that's limited to four players instead of allowing for play with either four or six players, as in the full game.&#10;&#10;",

Cards in hand can be used to attack and defend their colour buckets, taking out lower buckets causes cascades.&#10;&#10;The deck is five colours (farm animals) numbered 1-8, with two 1s and two 8s. Players start with 12 cards.  The start player plays 1-3 cards of one colour, giving a total sum. This total attacks the player to their left, who either plays 1-3 cards of the same colour totalling higher to defend, or loses a bucket. If they do defend though, that total then attacks the player to their left and so on, round the table. If it gets back to the start player, then can add 1-3 more cards to their original play, increasing the total. At some point, a player cannot defend, and buckets go tumbling. If you match the total attacking you this reverses the direction of play, meaning the cards already played are being added to additional cards to create high totals.&#10;&#10;Players look at their starting hand before building their pyramid o' buckets, so it pays to put your weak colours at the top.&#10;&#10;If you play a cards or cards, you draw back only one card from the draw deck.

The player with the most remaining is the winner.&#10;&#10;A game comes with enough buckets for 6 players, but you can play with multiple sets to allow larger groups to play.

    "description": "It is the late Republican period of Rome, and you are the leader of one of the factions in the city, competing for power in the Senate. You are increasing your wealth by buying up resources, then using your position to sell them to the state for fat profits. With the resulting cash, you then &quot;buy&quot; more Senators, controlling yet more votes in the Senate. Rome is constantly in conflict, and you know that at some point wars will increase to the point that the Senate will choose to centralize power and appoint a single leader. At that moment, the leader of the faction with the most Senators will be made Caesar.&#10;&#10;Senators is best described as an adversarial bidding game. Players earn money by purchasing resources at auction, extorting them from other players, then selling them in sets to the bank. Cash is required to support wars, defend against aggressive bids, and most importantly to buy more Senators. The game lasts a variable number of turns, and when the fourth war is revealed it immediately ends. At that point, the player with the most Senators wins.&#10;&#10;On their turn, a player first draws an event card from the deck, then takes one of three actions: a) launching an auction by putting new cards up for sale, b) extorting cards from other players, or c) cashing in sets of cards and buying new Senators. The game is simple, relatively short, and highly interactive. The key decisions are both tactical &mdash; how to value the cards at auction and how to bid for the wars, deficits, and other events given your relative position &mdash; and strategic: choosing which Senators to collect and how long to build sets versus when to cash in and buy Senators.&#10;&#10;Everyone is transacting all the time, and the game integrates different bidding systems including an open step bid (like many worker placement games) at the market auctions, blind bidding at the wars, an innovative high/low blind bid at the budget deficits, dutch auctions when new Senators arrive, and shotgun offers (similar to Kuhhandel or Medici v Strozzi) when players extort from each other.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Myth is a fully co-operative fantasy game. Players take on the role of one of 5 different heroes working together to defeat the Darkness. Each hero has a different skill set which represented by a unique deck of cards. Players spend Action Points by using cards. Once a certain amount of Action Points have been spent the Darkness fights back by activating monster lairs, spawning monster captains and eventually the Boss.&#10;&#10;A complete game in Myth is called a Story. Each Story is played over three Acts. Acts can be played sequentially, or can be split up over three different game sessions.&#10;&#10;Players' avatars within a Story are called Heroes. Myth Heroes are clothed in immense power, able to reave all but the mightiest foes. However, this power must be balanced lest the Darkness take too much notice. Players must weigh their actions against the Threat each will bring, with the consequences of awakening more evil and bringing doom on the party's endeavors. And be careful they must, as the Darkness is formidable and eager to snatch glory from the valiant.&#10;&#10;Heroes are controlled through an intuitive Hero Deck (videos for each Hero can be found in the Game Play Videos section below). Each deck plays uniquely and allows players more freedom of action and the ability to truly impact the Story each and every Act. Yet, cooperation is the key to victory and bloody fortune. Players must communicate, interact, and assist each other or surely the Darkness will cover all.&#10;&#10;Myth is a fully cooperative game. There is no player controlling the Darkness. The Darkness is governed by a set of rules unique to each Boss Deck and is activated through Hero actions. If the Heroes get overzealous, then the Darkness pushes back by activating Lairs, spawning Captains, and punishing the Heroes with devious Events. If the Heroes take a more subtle approach, then the Darkness reacts by reducing the potential for treasure and rewards. Without the treasures and equipment to upgrade, the Heroes will find each Act more difficult and eventually fail. The dynamic nature of the Darkness really lends a more fluid feel to the Story. Players aren't being driven by properties out of their control, nor are they being shepherded by a person whose skill has a direct impact on the enjoyment of the game.&#10;&#10;Myth is a fun fantasy romp where players feel truly heroic. In the playing of the game, the players are creating their own mythos. These stories are the ones carried away from the table, becoming myths themselves. And these are the myths, with friends and family, that we carry with us; telling and retelling our endeavors at the mead benches, earning treasured smiles and laughter.&#10;&#10;",

Players take control of the Allies or Central Powers fighting the war on land, at sea, and in the air all the while making tough economic and technological decisions at home.&#10;&#10;Fields of Despair has a unique block system designed to maintain the fog of war throughout the entire game. In most games, block combat values range from one to four. In Fields of Despair the range is zero to twenty.&#10;&#10;The range in values makes Fields of Despair a very deceptive game. Players can build up a large force with a single block instead of giving away their strategy with a stack of blocks.&#10;&#10;Movement is simple and free flowing. Players are allowed to &ldquo;make change&rdquo; during the movement phase. Thus a block with a combat value of 16 could be broken in two blocks of 8 before moving, or conversely two blocks could be combined into one. Zero-value blocks known as &ldquo;Deception&rdquo; blocks could also be part of the exchange. Thus after every movement phase you never really know the strength of your enemy.&#10;&#10;The fog of war isn&rsquo;t lost after first contact with the enemy. Blocks remain hidden even when enemies occupy the same hex and stay hidden until one player decides to allocate an air squadron for reconnaissance or sends his men across no man&rsquo;s land.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;1 Mounted Board 22&quot; x 34&quot;&#10;1 Rule Book&#10;1 Playbook of Scenarios and Examples of Play&#10;2 Player Boards (to track Econ and Tech)&#10;&#10;140 Blocks and Stickers&#10;- 48 Black&#10;- 49 Light Blue&#10;- 30 Tan&#10;- 10 Olive&#10;- 3 Orange&#10;&#10;240 Counters&#10;- 162 5/8&rdquo; Counters (+14 blanks)&#10;- 18 1/2&quot; Counters&#10;- 60 1&rdquo; Counters (Air, Artillery, Tanks)&#10;&#10;74 1/4&rdquo; wood cubes (Economic Points)&#10;- 30 Blue (Allied Naval/Production)&#10;- 30 Black (CP Naval/Production)&#10;- 12 Red (Eastern Front)&#10;- 2 White (Naval, no effect)&#10;&#10;2 Bags for drawing Naval War and Eastern Front chits/cubes&#10;&#10;Various Player Aids (Solo &amp; 2-Player)&#10;&#10;",

The player will control Friendly forces and attempt to complete a scenario against enemy forces that are controlled by the game system. At the start of each turn the player will play 1 card from their hand to the Initiative track. This card will determine the initiative values for each of the player&rsquo;s friendly teams and may have other effects depending on the card. After this the player will assign orders to each character on his side. This will determine the actions that the character can take this turn. Once all of the friendly characters have orders assigned to them the player will draw an Enemy AI Card for each enemy team with alerted characters on the board. These cards will determine the Initiative value for each enemy character and the Order that they will receive. The Order determines the actions that an Enemy Character will take that turn.&#10;The game turn is then played through in 4 Impulses. From the lowest initiative value to the highest each Character (Friendly and Enemy) each Character will perform the action specified on their Order counter. All Characters will act on Impulse 1 before moving to Impulse 2, then Impulse 3 and finally Impulse 4. At the end of the turn all Orders are removed and the played cards returned to the respective decks.&#10;&#10;With multiple maps and nearly a 800 counters Combat! will keep you entertained for years to come.&#10;&#10;There was a counter printing problem in the first copies, but that was corrected with replacements long ago; any copy you buy should have correct countersheets.&#10;&#10;",

(Tasks include things like &quot;Take no tricks&quot;, &quot;Take 1 Trick&quot;, or &quot;Take No Red Cards&quot;.)  Then, all of the cards are dealt out in front of the players before each hand.  Row by row, the players draft cards, and the dealer declares who would have won each row's trick, if it had been played that way.  Players use this information to deduce what the trump number and suit are.  After all the cards are drafted, each player - except the dealer - selects one of the task tiles she drafted, which will be her mission for the hand.  The dealer is stuck trying to uniquely accomplish someone else's task for the round - but at least doesn't have to preselect which person's goal he is trying to &quot;steal&quot;.  The hand is then played in the traditional fashion, with each player trying to take tricks or not, based on the goal she selected.  The first player to complete five tasks wins the game.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    M&#195;&#188; and Lots More&#10;&#10;&#10;",

During a rite of passage celebrated at the summer solstice, divers compete to retrieve the sacred stone of the village. The elder throws it from the top of the cliff, and the stone leads the contenders for the title of &quot;hero&quot; down to the depths of the ocean, aided in their quest by friendly sea turtles and manta rays.&#10;&#10;However, to retrieve the stone, they will need to avoid upsetting the sharks that inhabit the ocean...&#10;&#10;Dive plays simultaneously for all player divers, who start the game facing a shuffled stack of 36 transparent &quot;ocean&quot; cards. You have your own diver board and a set of five air tokens that are numbered 1-5 on both sides, with a shark on one side of each token.&#10;&#10;Dive explores the notion of perception, the ability of the divers to observe the ocean through a deck of transparent cards and to benefit from their observations. At the start of each round, you look into the &quot;waters&quot; before you to see how far you want to dive, with five levels being the maximum you can go (since you have five tokens). You then place the tokens on your board:&#10;&#10;&#10;     If you think a shark is at a certain level, you need any tokens on this level to be shark side up &mdash; and if you goof, calling &quot;shark&quot; when no shark is present or vice versa, then you remove all tokens from your diver board at this level and at deeper levels. You're done for the round.&#10;     If you think a certain level has a sea turtle or a manta ray, you might want to stack tokens on this level because whoever places the highest sum advances 1-2 spaces on the descent board (for a sea turtle) or moves onto the player token directly in below them on the descent board (for a manta ray).&#10;&#10;&#10;If you've finished evaluating a level for sharks, sea turtles, and manta rays, and anyone still has an air token on their board, you explore the next level. Once no one has any air tokens for the next level, the round ends, and everyone advances on the descent board equal to the number of levels that they successfully dove. Once you reach space #16 on the descent board, you can't use a manta ray to catch up to anyone, and if you fail the shark/no shark question for a level, you don't advance at all during that round, regardless of how many levels you first dove through successfully.&#10;&#10;Dive includes rules for solitaire play in which you compete against the village chief, and you can optionally play a competitive game with animal companions that give you a one-time bonus.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Quebec 1759 is a small, simple and short block board-wargame covering the conflict between the British and the French in Canada during the French and Indian War. The game comes with a gorgeous map drawn in the style of the period. Movement is conducted via a point-to-point system following the roads and towns in the area around Quebec. The game comes with handfuls of blocks to represent the British and French units.&#10;&#10;This title uses Columbia Games Block system. While there are variations in the rule sets, all of their wargames are based on the block system. Basically this means that rather than using the traditional counters to represent units on the map the game uses wooden blocks that stand upright with unit details only shown on one side. This does two things:  First it provides an easy way of producing a &quot;fog of war&quot; because your opponent can not tell, save through good memory, what type of unit a specific piece is or its current strength. Second, having the blocks stand on end allows the possibility of rotating a block so the current strength is the top number. Although most war games have some type of mechanism that lets units take steps in their overall strength, counters normally have at most two steps because they only have two sides. Blocks, however, have four so you can easily keep track of twice the amount of detail that many other war games provide. With the use of blocks Columbia has provided a way of adding a good deal of depth to their war games without adding complex layers of bookkeeping, allowing interesting and relatively short sessions of play.&#10;&#10;",

Poor Coyote had lost everything.&#10;&#10;They sat down by a fire to dry off and rest. Coyote became jealous of the other animals because they still had all their things, so he challenged them to a bluffing game to win their belongings. The other animals agreed to the challenge as they thought Coyote would never win. After all, he is known to never tell the truth &mdash; but in this game everybody has to lie because no one knows the truth...&#10;&#10;In the bluffing game Coyote, you always see the cards of the other players, but never your own. When it's your turn, you must announce a number that is less than the total of all the cards in the game, yet higher than the previous number given. Alternatively, you can challenge the number previously announced. Finally, when all the cards are revealed, you'll see who has the cunning Coyote on their side.&#10;&#10;Coyote is in the same game line as Spicy, with the game box and card backs being decorated with a special metallic print in copper. As in the tradition of the Northwest Coast Tribes, copper is a symbol of prosperity and cultural wealth.&#10;&#10;The artist Zona Evon Shroyer (Yupik Alaskan Native) is a master of the traditional Northwest Coastal art, whose richness of detail and complexity requires years of study and practice. For the cover illustration of Coyote, she designed a modern silhouette for the coyote, which she then filled in a classical manner with other animal motifs: turtle, beaver, and bear &mdash; the animals that he is sitting around the fire with and playing a game, in our little story.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "The game of seafaring adventure in ancient Polynesia!&#10;&#10;Tongiaki is a tile-laying game that reflects the risks and successes of these early explorers.  There is often a chance that an expedition will end in utter failure... or, it might land in Tahiti, Fiji, or Oahu.  Clever players might even found Royal Islands to call their own!  Only fate will decide if, and where, sailors make landfall, although careful planning will give players the best odds for ever seeing land again.  The goal of the game is to spread your &quot;tribe&quot; to many different islands in order to gain the most victory points.  Islands have victory point values from 2-5, and having multiple pawns on an island gives no bonus.&#10;&#10;This game uses a unique tile design never seen in any other game (hexes with wavy edges), and is easy to explain and easy to enjoy.  Players all begin on the island of Tonga, and immediate overcrowding forces players to search out other islands to populate.  For each expedition that leaves, a new tile is placed, revealing either an island, or a &quot;water path&quot; that may or may not have a number from 2-4, indicating that many different players (not number of boats) must make up that expedition for it to survive the voyage (draw and place an additional tile).  In this way, the game encourages both cooperative and competitive play at the same time.&#10;&#10;From the back of the box:&#10;&#10;300AD: The Polynesians embark on daring sailing trips and explore thousands of Pacific islands.  Driven by overpopulation and a desire for adventure, they set forth into the unknown on simple catamarans called Tongiakis.  Without any help from navigational instruments, they charted their course with the help of the sun, stars, wind and water temperature.  Birds, reefs, cloud formations, fishes and distinctive waves were the signals telling them that land lay nearby.  Each trip became a life-threatening journey, as landfall was often impossible to achieve or the way home became cut off by strong currents.  Suspense was their constant companion.  Will the next hour, the next day bring them to their goal...  Or will the ocean's currents force them to drift endlessly at sea?&#10;&#10;Description from Uberplay's web site:&#10;&#10;While originally designed to be somewhat cooperative, it can easily be played 'aggressively' in such a way as to rob other players of points and diminishing their presence on the board. The movement of pieces reaches a point where a 'triggered cascade' can alter the game drastically. Trying to foresee and select expansion moves leads to a weighty-er game than suggested at first glance.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "What a fuss. The frightfully fearsome feudal lord Fieso has held the fascinating fairy Fabula in captivity since the famous February festivities. In order to free the fairy must you redeem her from the Fieso's fetid and fusty feculent fetter. Frustrated you flee into the Finnish fjords in order to fetch a few of the fascinating fetishes so highly favored by the foul prince. Frantically you begin bartering with the local folks: a few Florins will get you some Fish which can be traded for Flowers, which again can be traded for Fur, Fruits, Flutes, Fettucine, Furniture, Fuel, Fiddles or maybe even a fridge. When your finances allow you to obtain 3 different fetishes you have won the game.&#10;&#10;In Fische Fluppen Frikadellen, players are traders running (or sailing on a raft!) around a town, visiting various market stalls in order to buy, sell, or trade goods.  There are three different types of stalls in the game.  Merchants will sell you a specific good of the 5 base goods in the game according to current market prices, and will also buy a specific good from you, also according to market prices.  Traders will accept a specific good and give you two of a specific good in return.  Finally, there are dealer stalls which offer fetishes.  They each want specific combinations of goods, offering you a fetish in return.  There are three different fetishes in the game, and the first player to trade for all three fetishes wins!&#10;&#10;Furthermore, whenever a player visits a market stall, a special ability of that stall activates.  These special abilities cause all sorts of game events, such as production of goods at merchants (you can't buy a good at a merchant if he doesn't have any available), price increases of goods, getting an extra turn or free commodity, changing the position of two merchants, etc.  Often times, players will need to utilize these special abilities to conquer their goals.&#10;&#10;The really unique feature of Fische Fluppen Frikadellen is that there are three different versions of the game, so it can be played by up to 15 people on three different, interconnected tables!  You'll need one copy of the game for every 5 players.&#10;&#10;At the start of a 15-player game, for example, there will be three boards, with 5 players at each board.  Each board is set up individually by the players starting there, and there are 36 merchants in the game with only 12 of them used per board, so it is very possible for each board to be significantly different than the others!  Furthermore, there will only be one of the three fetishes available at each board, so players will need to sail off to all three boards over the course of the game in order to win!  This means picking up all of your things and moving to a different table.&#10;&#10;You aren't allowed to peek at the other tables before you move, which means it is a complete surprise what the market conditions and various stalls will be on the board that you move to.  This mechanic also means that there will not always be an equal amount of players at each board throughout the game, so players at boards with less players will likely get turns more frequently than players at boards with more players; another reason to leave your current board for a different one!&#10;&#10;",

Germany's 17th Army and 1st Panzer Army steamrolled over all opposition until they reached the mountains. There the Russians slowed and then stopped the Germans at the outskirts of Novorossisk, on the road to Tuapse and along the Terek River. This infuriated Hitler who then took over personal command of Army Group A and poured replacements and reinforcements into the area that were badly needed at Stalingrad. Eventually 27 Axis divisions were fighting south of the Don.&#10;&#10;The Axis forces include 2 mountain divisions, 2 light (j&auml;ger) divisions, an SS motorized division (Wiking), and 3 panzer divisions -- two of which had three tank battalions while many on the east front have only one. The German army is accompanied by 1 Slovakian and 7 Romanian divisions.&#10;&#10;The ranks of the Soviet army in the Caucasus is filled with Armenians, Georgians, Azerbaijanis, Cossacks and Turkoman who have questionable loyalty. These divisions are reinforced by Soviet Guard and NKVD units sent across the Caspian, and by Soviet Naval troops stationed along the Black Sea.&#10;&#10;The Caucasus Campaign is a quick playing, moderately complex game with large hexes and easy-viewing 5/8 counters. The game system is based on the classic Igo-Ugo/movement-combat-exploitation system, but modified with elements from Ardennes '44 (specifically: Determined Attacks and Defense and unit morale). The tournament scenario (6 turns) can be completely in roughly 2 hours. The full game is 14 turns long and can be finished in one sitting (approximately 5 hours).&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 1 week&#10;Hex: 18 miles / 29 kilometers&#10;Units: Regiments to Divisions&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 22 x 34&quot; full color map&#10;One &amp; 1/2 dual-side printed countersheets (264 5/8&quot; counters)&#10;One 24-page The Caucasus Campaign rulebook&#10;Two dual-side printed Player Aid cards&#10;Ten small plastic baggies&#10;One 6-sided dice&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: High&#10;Complexity Level: Medium-High&#10;Players: 1 or more&#10;Playing Time: 3-6&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "User Summary&#10;&#10;Now YOU enter the courtroom during five fateful days of July, 1885, when the future of a country hung in the balance, and the defendant, Louis Riel, faced hanging on a charge of treason.&#10;&#10;From the publisher&#10;&#10;Canada&rsquo;s westward expansion was very different than that of the United States. In the U.S., conflict in the westward movement was between the White Man and the Native Indian, and a common language united U.S. settlers. Language, however, has divided Canada ever since General Wolfe united the country by arms at the Plains of Abraham.&#10;&#10;Canada&rsquo;s settlers pushed westward, led by fur-traders and trappers who were predominately French Catholic. These pioneers intermarried with the Native Indians, producing a new race and a new culture &ndash; the M&eacute;tis.&#10;&#10;When the Canadian government made treaties with Native Indians, the M&eacute;tis, being neither Native nor White, did not receive any comparable consideration. Wanting to protect their rights against the remote Anglo-Protestant government in eastern Canada, resentment grew into rebellion in Manitoba's Red River Valley in 1869. Louis Riel led this resistance and forced the government into compromise, resulting in the Manitoba Act.&#10;&#10;Due to his participation in the rebellion and in the execution of English Protestant, Thomas Scott, Riel himself was forced to flee to the United States. While residing there, Riel obtained American citizenship.&#10;&#10;When trouble between the M&eacute;tis and the government occurred further west, in Saskatchewan, the M&eacute;tis recalled their former savior to lead them. Louis Riel and Gabriel Dumont, a local M&eacute;tis leader, initially worked toward a peaceful solution for their grievances. However, this movement eventually grew into a resistance, known as the North West Resistance. The Conservative government in Ottawa amassed a military force to crush it, and finally did at the Battle of Batoche, 9 &ndash; 12 May, 1885. While Gabriel Dumont fled to the United States after the battle; Louis Riel was tried and hanged for High Treason in Canada.&#10;&#10;There are many reasons why the first Riel resistance succeeded and the second failed. The westward expansion of the railroad allowed the federal government to deploy superior forces rapidly to the field. Riel himself embraced unorthodox religious views &ndash; views that alienated the Catholic Church and its devout supporters who were the key to his first resistance&rsquo;s success.&#10;&#10;",

They all have the same goal: to rebuild their civilizations and reclaim their former glory.

The core game also pushes the boundaries of the genre further with a lot of bold and innovative designs, among which:&nbsp;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Faction asymmetry. Each faction has three different points of asymmetry: their innate abilities, political philosophies and battle masteries, for a modular and completely different experience based on your civilization.&nbsp;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Tactic cards. There are no dice in the game, and you&rsquo;ll never lose a battle because of bad luck.

You shape seven hundred years of vampiric and human history in pursuit of ancient secrets, while trying to evade the inquisition and attempting to save what's left of your humanity.&#10;&#10;Heritage is a quick-playing legacy game. Each game, players gather characters from a common pool for their bloodlines. These characters influence different vampiric &quot;battlegrounds&quot; and help in fulfilling history-based missions. For example, a noble-born warrior might support Joan of Arc in ending the siege of Orleans, while at the same time changing the balance of an internal vampiric power struggle or attracting the unwanted attention of the inquisition. Aside from collecting characters in their bloodline, players can also use the unique intrigue cards of the clan they are playing &mdash; changing the rules of the game in ways that fit the character of that particular clan.&#10;&#10;After any individual game, the players get to collect their achievements in their timeline, which serves as a chronicle of their actions throughout the seven hundred years of history and also influences the final outcome of the campaign.&#10;&#10;Additionally, players may turn some mortals into vampires permanently by taking the cards out of their sleeves and turning them around, revealing their vampiric side and giving them new abilities and a name. These get put back in the common pool and can be additionally enhanced in future games. To allow for surprises when embracing mortals, all character cards come pre-sleeved!&#10;&#10;In this fashion, players proceed through history as determined by the progression of historic mission cards, unlocking new challenges, characters, and rewards along the way.&#10;&#10;Eventually, the seven hundred years will end with a climactic conclusion as players scramble to unravel ancient mysteries using the clues, allies, and power they have gathered throughout the campaign.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Phantom Leader - Solitaire &#10;&#10;Description:&#10;Phantom Leader places you in command of a US Air Force or US Navy Tactical Fighter squadron in Vietnam between 1964 and 1972. You must not only destroy the targets but you must also balance the delicate political repercussions of your attacks. If you strike too hard, your air offensive might be put on hold, strike too light, and you&rsquo;ll be blamed for losing the war.&#10;&#10;Welcome to the Vietnam Air War!&#10;&#10;Each of the campaigns can be played with either an Air Force or Navy squadron. The targets assigned to each service are different and change the complexion of the campaigns. Each campaign can be played with three different durations of: Skirmish, Conflict, or War.&#10;&#10;Each mission takes roughly 30 minutes to set-up, plan, and resolve.&#10;&#10;Each of your pilots has their own skills. Selecting the right pilots and weapons for a mission is vital to its success. As you fly missions, your pilots will gain experience and fatigue. With experience, their skills improve, but as their fatigue increases, their skills decrease and they might not be able to fly for several missions.&#10;&#10;For those of you familiar with our modern era Hornet Leader series of games, you might be wondering what&rsquo;s different about Phantom Leader&hellip;&#10;&#10;The freedom of being able to select the best mission based on military objectives is something that is commonplace for today&rsquo;s military. Back in Vietnam, the military was responsible for carrying out their orders, while at the same time being extremely limited in the weapons and tactics they were allowed to use to complete those orders. In many cases, the specific weapons, approach paths, and bombing altitudes were generated target-by-target at the White House. The mission specifics were then sent down the chain of command to the individual pilots flying the mission. As you can imagine, this was not the best way to run an air campaign.&#10;&#10;Every target has a Political value. If you destroy it, you move the Political counter to the right a number of spaces equal to its value. As the counter gets moved to the right, your future target choices are reduced to those that are less politically sensitive. Which target you choose not to attack is also important. You get to move the Political counter to the left a number of spaces equal its Political value. [this last sentence is not in fact true for the game, though it appears in the game blurb; confirmed by the author]&#10;&#10;This means that while you might like to flatten a big enemy target and rack up the victory points, it might be better for you to choose a pointless target and move the Political counter in your favor instead.&#10;&#10;Another difference is in combat power. For the last couple decades, the US Air Force and Navy have enjoyed air superiority due to training and technology. Such was not the case in the skies over Vietnam. The enemy had different, but just as capable, equipment. They also had the training and will to use it to its utmost.&#10;&#10;They soon became aware of the limitations placed on the US forces by the politicians, and used those limitations to their advantage.&#10;&#10;For example, at times, US pilots were not permitted to fire on enemy aircraft until they were visually identified. This negated any range advantage conveyed by the radar-homing AIM-7 Sparrow missiles. It was also a common limitation that enemy aircraft could only be attacked in the air. US pilots were not allowed to attack enemy airbases. US aircraft were also limited to flying predictable flight paths, at set times. This made setting up ambushes much easier for the enemy.&#10;&#10;So, while you might be a Hornet Leader ace, Vietnam is a whole different ballgame!&#10;&#10;Components: &#10;&#10;     110 Full color Cards &#10;         12 F-4 Phantom IIs (USAF) &#10;         8 F-105 Thunderchiefs (USAF)&#10;         2 F-105G Wild Weasels (USAF)&#10;         4 F-100 Super Sabers (USAF) &#10;         2 F-104A Starfighters (USAF)&#10;         1 EB-66 Destroyer (USAF)&#10;         8 F-4 Phantom IIs (USN) &#10;         6 A-4 Skyhawks (USN)&#10;         5 A-7 Corsair II (USN) &#10;         5 A-6 Intruders (USN) &#10;         4 F-8 Crusaders (USN)&#10;         1 EA-6A Electric Intruder (USN) &#10;         34 Targets &#10;         18 Special Events &#10;    &#10;     Full Color, 20-page Rulebook &#10;     Full Color Double-sided Counter Sheet (176 x 5/8&quot; counters) &#10;     6 Full Color Campaign Sheets &#10;         War in the South (1965) USAF &amp; USN&#10;         Rolling Thunder (1967) USAF &amp; USN&#10;         Linebacker (1972) USAF &amp; USN&#10;    &#10;     3 Full Color Player Aid Cards &#10;         Tactical Display&#10;         Card Diplay Sheet&#10;         Help Sheet&#10;    &#10;     1 Ten-sided die &#10;     1 Player Log master (to be photocopied prior to play)&#10;&#10;&#10;Other Leader series games by Dan Verssen&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Phantom Leader: Deluxe Edition&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Grimoire is the French word for &quot;spellbook&quot;, and smart use of your spellbook &ndash; more specifically, the spells within said book &ndash; will determine whether you succeed in this game.&#10;&#10;Each turn in Grimoire starts by revealing several cards on the game board; each card has either a victory point (VP) value or is a character with a particular way to earn VPs at the end of the game. Once these cards are revealed, each player secretly chooses which spell to cast in his spellbook by placing a bookmark on the appropriate page. Everyone then reveals which spell they chose, with the spells going off in order from weakest (those with the lowest numbers) to strongest. Some weak spells nerf stronger ones, and the order in which players choose cards from the display can be flipped topsy-turvy depending on who plays which spells.&#10;&#10;In the One Draw and Z-Man versions, the game ends as soon as one player has collected either ten character cards or ten treasure cards; in the Schmidt Spiele version, the game ends after a fixed number of rounds. All players then tally their points, and the player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;Differences between the versions:&#10;&#10;&#10;    As noted above, the game ending conditions differ in the 2012 Schmidt Spiele version.&#10;    The Z-Man Games and Schmidt Spiele versions of Grimoire accommodate five players, while the original One Draw release allows only 2-4 players.&#10;    The Schmidt Spiele version contains four new character cards and two new treasure cards, includes hardcover books instead of softcover, changes two spells, and uses a more elaborate game board that depicts the spells and allows players to mark the spells chosen with small figures to track who has played what.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Players trap each other with clever spatial moves, bluffing and misdirection. The action economy is very well balanced, so every turn offers an opportunity for strategy and tough decisions.&#10;&#10;The feeling of the game differs with every number of players:&#10;&#10;    2 player is the most cerebral and controlled&#10;    3 player is the most chaotic, yet still within your grasp&#10;    4 player is played in teams, offering neat collaborative gameplay&#10;&#10;&#10;",

In every game, you and your opponent match wits and resources over key events. If you can thwart your opponent, you claim the event, bringing you closer to victory. Whether you seek to triumph through military might, or use diplomacy to achieve your ends, the fate of the galaxy rests in your hands.&#10;&#10;On one side of this galactic battleground are the heroes of the Rebel Alliance. Only rarely can these heroes go toe to toe with the unlimited reserves of the Imperial Navy and Army. Instead, the iconic characters of Star Wars and the unsung heroes of the Rebellion must work in secret, utilizing diplomacy, reconnaissance, and the Force to achieve their aims. Even when the Rebellion deploys its full military strength to win a battle or destroy a key Imperial emplacement, they need the groundwork put in place by Alliance Special Forces.&#10;&#10;Opposing the heroic endeavors of the Rebel Alliance is the massive power of the Empire, led by the twisted Emperor. The dark side of the Force is strong with the Emperor and Darth Vader, and the military might of the Empire is unparalleled across the galaxy. Whether you undertake aggressive negotiations or hire bounty hunters and scum to ferret out Rebel spies, making the Empire the ultimate power in the galaxy rests in your hands.&#10;&#10;To successfully win these struggles and reclaim the galaxy in Star Wars: Empire vs. Rebellion, you will need to utilize all of your resources. Every turn, you can increase your faction&rsquo;s presence at the current event by drawing the top card from your deck and putting it into play. Each resource card you play give you more power and brings you closer to the objective value of the current event. As an example, the resource card shown to the right has a resource value of five, which it contributes to your total resource value while in play. Playing more resource cards may bring you closer to your target, but it also makes your efforts more obvious. If your total resource value ever passes the event&rsquo;s objective value, your forces are discovered and your opponent claims the event.&#10;&#10;Instead of playing a new resource card, you can also trigger the power of a resource card currently in play, exercising the might of the Empire or the cunning of the Rebel Alliance. To activate a resource card&rsquo;s power, you must exhaust it by rotating it 90 degrees clockwise. Once a card is exhausted, you can't use its power unless it becomes ready again. In addition, an exhausted card contributes its exhausted resource value, shown in the lower left-hand corner of the card while the resource is ready.&#10;&#10;",

This involves not only turning your bid-cards up but also then playing with your hand of cards exposed on the table before the opening lead.&#10;&#10;While designed for three players, the four-player version is faithful to the original but played with a standard 52-card deck.

    "description": "From Game Report Review:&#10;&#10;The game comes with four identical sets of ten paintings, each depicting a scene packed (to greater and lesser extents) with various objects. Each of up to four players or teams uses their own set, so there&rsquo;s no craning around to see the picture at the far end of the table. In fact, spiffy cardboard easels prop up the scenes nicely so they&rsquo;re easier to view.  Everyone loads identical scenes onto their easels and a deck of cards  provides a letter for the round. Everyone gets sixty seconds to write down as many things beginning with that letter as they can find in the scene. Although each word can be used only once - a football and baseball wouldn&rsquo;t count as two BALLS - an object can be used multiple times for different words (e.g., BASEBALL, BALL).  Once time has expired, players read through the lists. Any object on multiple lists scores one point for those who wrote it. Any item unique to a single list scores three points. When all lists have been scored everyone advances to the next scene and a new letter is chosen. The high score after all 12 scenes wins.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Kaleidos Junior&#10;&#10;&#10;",

This UNO card deck is double-sided with a &quot;light&quot; side and a &quot;dark&quot; side. You start off playing with the light side, but if someone plays a Flip card, you have to switch to playing the dark side. And on the dark side, there are different action cards with stiffer penalties. Instead of a Draw One card, the dark side has a Draw Five card. Instead of a Skip Card, the dark side has a Skip Everyone card. You have to continue playing with the dark side until another Flip card is played.&#10;&#10;If you don't know how to play UNO, each player takes a turn matching a card from their hand to the card on the top of the discard pile, either by number, color, or symbol. If you don't have a match, you must draw a card from the draw pile.&#10;&#10;The symbols represent the action cards, such as Wild, Skip, Wild Draw 2, Draw One, and Reverse. This version also includes a Flip card that turns the cards to the dark side, which has the following actions: Draw Five, Reverse, Skip Everyone, Wild, Wild Draw Color, and Flip.&#10;&#10;When you play your next-to-last card, you must yell &quot;UNO!&quot; to indicate you only have one card left. If you don't yell &quot;UNO&quot; and someone catches you, you must draw two cards. Once a player runs out of cards, the round is over, and that player receives points for all of the cards left in their opponents' hands. Play until one player reaches 500 points.&#10;&#10;",

Purchased from France as part of the Louisiana Territory in 1803, the region was divided into square mile plots for the settlers from the east. In this game, players take the role of these settlers, developing the plots of land and establishing farms in America&rsquo;s &ldquo;Heartland.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;The game, entitled &ldquo;Eine Frage der &Auml;hre&rdquo; in German, is a three-dimensional tile-laying game. Each tile contains two types of crops to be planted as well as a certain number of &ldquo;barnyard points.&rdquo; When placing tiles, players must always choose between scoring immediate &ldquo;harvest&rdquo; (victory) points or developing their farms through the barnyard points, which will provide victory points over the longer term. In addition, there is a race to the top of each barnyard point track in order to acquire the most valuable animals for the farm. Players may also &ldquo;rotate crops&rdquo; by using their tiles to cover up fields that bring their opponent&rsquo;s points, possibly expanding their own farms in the process. This translates into an hour-long game aimed at families and gamers with multiple paths to victory. &#10; Source: Jeffrey D. Allers&#10;&#10;",

To do this they will need to marshall their forces, dominate continents, acquire relics of power and call their Gods to earth.&#10;&#10;Risk Godstorm uses the basic combat elements of classic Risk but alters many other elements. The game is played on an ancient map of the world that focuses on Europe and Northern Africa. Atlantis is also present and highly desirable however a chaotic event can see the fabled city sink into oblivion, taking all the forces present there with it. At its core the players are trying to control territories and controlling entire continents earns the players bonus units to deploy and further their cause.&#10;&#10;As in the play of Risk 2210 A.D., Risk Godstorm is played over 5 rounds (called Epochs here). At the end of that time frame the player with the most Victory Points is declared the winner. Victory Points are earned for the number of territories controlled + region bonuses + control of crypts and altars in the Underworld and for every relic that offers a territory bonus if that territory is controlled.  Also like Risk 2210 A.D., the game begins with a number of territories out of play. Here they are called Plague Lands. One of the key differences to classic Risk is that the Underworld can be invaded and defeated units can also be sent to the Underworld to fight again, with some proving themselves worthy enough to return to the Earth.&#10;&#10;Risk Godstorm also allows players to play Classic Risk using the Godstorm board for an alternate experience.&#10;&#10;",

This card represents their strategy for the coming turn and to a large extent dictates the actions a player can take.&#10;&#10;During their production phase, players spend production points to buy additional factories and units. Each individual unit type has its own unique statistics and effects, so players have to carefully consider the composition of their armies.&#10;&#10;In combat, players alternate rolling dice and destroying units until one side has been eliminated (either due to casualties or retreats) or a cease-fire is declared.&#10;&#10;At the end of each game round, players score victory points for power sources, capitals, and majorities they control. The player who controls the most land areas earns bonus victory points, as does the player who controls the most sea areas and the player who controls the most production centers. The first player to amass a set number of victory points while also controlling a capital is the winner.&#10;&#10;Only once a player has amassed at least half the victory points required to win can he or she attack an enemy capital.

Everyone knows there's only one place the visitors all want to stay: The Fairy Tale Inn!&#10;&#10;It's everyone's favorite home away from home, and like always, the place is going to be fully booked. Each of the Inn's two owners compete to be the one who takes the best care of the guests. They take turns ushering guests into enchanted rooms, gaining gold for strategic placement, and successfully keeping the guests from fighting. (Note to self: NEVER put Little Red Riding Hood and the Big Bad Wolf in adjoining rooms!)&#10;&#10;In Fairy Tale Inn, two players try to earn the most gold coins by the end of the game. To set up, players select the character cards of guests who will be present during that game, then take the corresponding character tokens and toss them into the mixing bag. Next, players randomly draw those tokens to fill up the guest list board. After randomly choosing who goes first, the first player gets a gold coin, while the other player gets two. Now the game begins!&#10;&#10;On a player's turn, they pick a character token from the guest list board, paying the cost indicated on the board, then they place that guest in the inn, sliding the token into the vertical game board with the colored side facing themselves (while the monochrome-colored side faces their opponent).&#10;&#10;After the token slides into the slot, the player may score points based on the room the guest ended up in, as well as any other guests that might be around. Each character has different abilities that say how they give gold to their corresponding innkeeper. For example, the Little Pigs like to be close to one another; they automatically give the player who placed them 1 gold coin and an extra gold coin for each other Little Pig token connected to them. The Big Bad Wolf, on the other hand, gives their player three gold coins for each row where their innkeeper played more Big Bad Wolf tokens than their opponent at the end of the game. (In case of a tie, neither player gets gold.) There's an art to placing guests as several rooms of the Inn are enchanted and will give a bonus or penalty to the player that places a guest there.&#10;&#10;The game continues with players picking and placing guests until three columns in the inn have been completely filled. When that happens, players gain gold from characters with end of game abilities, then the player who has gained the most gold wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Hellenes: Campaigns of the Peloponnesian War (GMT Games) is 2 player game on the Peloponnesian War of the Greek classical age designed by Craig Besinque (EuroFront series). Based on a variant of the Hammer of the Scots/Liberty system, Hellenes features good historical flavor, fast play, and lots of options for both players.&#10;&#10;One player plays Sparta, the dominant land power of the era; the other plays Athens, the dominant sea power. Each side also seeks the allegiance of minor Greek city-states and barbarian tribes: some that persevere and others that come and go. Revolts, sieges, leaders, wintering, and civic discord all play important roles.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to erode enemy prestige to the point of Surrender by capturing cities, winning battles, and devastating enemy territory with raids. Walled cities are very strong in defense, leaving Siege as a common method of reduction. But if a Siege is broken by a relieving force, the lost battle reduces the besieger's prestige!&#10;&#10;The map depicts Ancient Greece in the Aegean area, including the Peloponnese, continental Greece, Macedonia, Thrace and Ionia. A separate area on the map contains Sicily. Units include fleets, cavalry, archers, infantry and hoplites. Cards drive military actions and special events. Each card has both an Action value and an Event, and can be played for either purpose but not both. Actions include unit buildup, adding new units and group movement. Events include leader change, plague, barbarian uprisings, revolts, civil unrest, etc.&#10;&#10;Hellenes includes 4 scenarios: The 431 BC Campaign (10 turns), The Sicily Campaign (5 turns), The 415 BC Campaign (12 turns), and The 413 BC Campaign (10 turns).  Each one plays in about 3-6 hours.&#10;&#10;Designer: Craig Besinque&#10;Developer: Joel Toppen&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Art Decko, first released as Promenade, is a light strategy game for 2 to 4 painting collectors in which you try to create a valuable deck of gold and painting cards over the course of play. These cards &mdash; gold and paintings &mdash; both count as currencies in the game, and you can use them to purchase more paintings, acquire more gold, and pay for exhibition space in a museum. Your long-term goal is to manipulate the market value of certain styles of artwork, while also earning points by placing paintings in the museum.&#10;&#10;The game includes paintings from five styles of art &mdash; Art Nouveau, Pop Art, Renaissance, Surrealism, and Impressionism &mdash; and you start with five random painting cards in your deck. Each art style starts with a value of 1 gold for a painting. You also have five starting gold cards in your deck, with the cards being worth 1 or 2 gold, with some cards having a special ability on them.&#10;&#10;To start the game, shuffle your deck, then take five cards in hand. Fill the four galleries with 2-3 random paintings each, then place two random 3-gold cards (each with a special power) in the bank, along with the deck of 5-gold cards. Paintings in galleries cost 1-8 gold, while gold cards cost 5 or 8 gold. On a turn, take two actions from these three choices, repeating an action, if desired:&#10;&#10;&bull; Haggle: Discard a card from your hand to draw two cards from your deck.&#10;&bull; Acquire: Pay the acquisition cost of a painting or gold card by discarding cards from your hand, then place that card in your discard pile. Increase the &quot;market rating&quot; of the painting's art style or gold by the value listed in the gallery/bank. As the market rating of an art style increases, each painting in that style is worth more gold, effectively increasing its buying power; that art style is also worth more points at game's end.&#10;&bull; Exhibit: Pay the exhibition cost for a gallery, then place a painting into that gallery that matches one of that gallery's invitation markers. (A gallery might want, for example, 2 Impressionistic paintings, 1 Renaissance painting, and 1 painting of any type.) Mark that painting with one of your ownership tokens, then place the related invitation marker on the highest available victory point (VP) space, scoring those points for yourself immediately. That painting is now removed from your deck.&#10;&#10;If you use the special ability on a gold card instead of its listed numerical value, remove that card from the game.&#10;&#10;At the end of your turn, discard any number of cards from your hand, then refill your hand to five cards. If a gallery has no paintings in it, refill all of the galleries with 2-3 paintings, then replace each empty gallery's cost token with the next highest one available. When at least twelve paintings are in the museum, the painting deck is empty, or an art style or gold reaches a market rating of 70, finish the round, then proceed to final scoring.&#10;&#10;The value of gold depends on its market rating, with its value ratio ranging from 6:1 to 1:1. Each painting in your deck is worth 1-7 VPs depending on the market rating of its art style. Each exhibition space in the museum also has a random bonus that was revealed at the start of play, and you can earn additional points through these bonuses. In the end, the player with most VPs wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Stay alive, gain a fortune...&#10;&#10;Dead Last &mdash; originally known as Tontine &mdash; is a &quot;social collusion&quot; game of shifting alliances, betrayals, and murder for profit in which players must conspire and vote upon whom to kill each round. Any means of overt or covert communication is allowed &mdash; a glance, a nod, pointing under the table, flashing a card, anything &ndash; but make sure you don't tip off the target or they could ambush you instead! In the end, one or two players will remain, either claiming all the gold or squaring off in a final showdown before starting the next round of play. The first player to score 24 points of gold wins.&#10;&#10;Thematically, the inspiration for the game is one of the oldest pulp fiction/detective novel tropes: the Tontine, a financial investment that accrues, but pays out only to the last surviving member of the group. This practice is now largely illegal as it famously had the tendency to lead to murder.&#10;&#10;But it is the subtle art of communication that delivers the fun of the game and you conspire with each other. If you are the target of the most votes, you're dead, and if you did not side with the popular vote, you are also dead, so you constantly have to stay informed or deceive your target to band together without letting the target know. Wink, smile, kill &mdash; that's the whole game. As soon as someone asks, &quot;Hey, wanna play Dead Last?&quot;, the game has already begun &mdash; and if you don't know who the target is, it very well could be you...&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Last Blitzkrieg is the first entry in the new Series: Battalion Combat Series (MMP), which simulates combat in World War II (and beyond) at the battalion scale. Its subject is the German Ardennes offensive Wacht Am Rhein (the Battle of the Bulge) on four detailed maps (at 1km per hex) and with 1,680 counters. Last Blitzkrieg covers the battle in a level of detail rarely seen before and does so in a very playable manner. The BCS itself was designed to show that battalion level combat is its own subject, being neither &quot;small divisions&quot; nor &quot;large platoons&quot;. The results may surprise some players, but will hopefully pique the interest of all and allow them to see many things they thought they already knew in a fresh light.&#10;&#10;Key Battalion Combat Series concepts include:&#10;&#10;    Objectives&#10;    Recon Units&#10;    Concentrated Armor and Support&#10;    Prepared Defense&#10;    MSRs and Combat Trains&#10;    Set Piece Combats vs. Shock Attacks vs. Engagements&#10;    Artillery Barrages&#10;    Artillery Asset Points&#10;    Attack by Fire&#10;    SNAFU&#10;    Activation by Formation&#10;    Traffic and Coordination&#10;    Fatigue&#10;    Memory Markers&#10;&#10;&#10;Last Blitzkrieg also adds:&#10;&#10;    Bridge Blowing&#10;    Greif Teams&#10;    Weather&#10;    Tiger Maintenance Woes&#10;    Voraus Units&#10;&#10;&#10;Game play commences on 16 December 44 and ends on 31 December 44 (with each turn being one day) allowing the first phase of the Allied counterattack to proceed. The winner is determined by comparing the German high water mark in Victory Point hexes against the situation at the very end of the game.&#10;&#10;In addition to the full campaign, which uses a 4-map &quot;box&quot; layout, there are 9 additional scenarios for a total of 10 scenarios of various sizes:&#10;&#10;    Two 4-map scenarios:&#10;         Last Blitzkrieg Campaign: 16 turns &#10;         Final Blitzkrieg: 10 turns&#10;    &#10;    Two 2-map scenarios:&#10;         Breakthrough Campaign: 6 turns using Maps C and D&#10;         Advance &amp; Destroy: 10 turns using Map D and a portion of Map B&#10;    &#10;    Six 1-map scenarios (including two scenarios on portions of a single map)&#10;         Northern Campaign: 6 turns using Map C&#10;         Southern Campaign: 6 turns using Map D&#10;         Kampfgruppe Peiper: 5 turns using portion of Map C&#10;         The Goose Egg: 5 turns using portion of Map C&#10;         Bastogne: Screaming Eagles Under Siege: 8 turns using portions of Maps B and D (total playing area is less than one map)&#10;         Tip of the Spear: 4 turns using Map A&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;Last Blitzkrieg was designed to bring all of this&mdash;and much more&mdash;to your table in a most historically accurate game that is jam-packed with information.

In many countries, Canasta is still played in more or less its original form, sometimes alongside a number of variations. In North America, however, the game of Canasta has continued to develop, and the version now favored by many American players, called Modern American Canasta, is very different from the classic game.&#10;&#10;Canasta is generally agreed to be best for four players, playing in partnerships. However, there are playable versions for two, three or six players.&#10;&#10;Canasta is a standard deck playing card game modified by adding two decks together and adding all four Jokers.&#10;&#10;",
