    "description": "Chaotic Studio is a drawing game that challenges players&rsquo; ability of image segmentation and deduction. According to chosen subject, each player must prepare a specific drawing in three parts on three separate transparent cards respectively. Then, other players try to guess what the Subject is when one of the three parts is revealed and the other two are displayed in a mix with other drawings scattered on the table! Longer before anyone gets the Subject correctly, more victory points (VP) the Active Player (the drawer) will score. However, the Active Player will gain no VP at all if no one guesses correctly.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "The goal of Jumbo Grand Prix is to create strong race cars that score the most racing points.&#10;&#10;Every player starts with 4 cards. In the next 4 rounds they try to build a competitive race car by changing their cards. A race car consists of a coach-work card, a tire card, an engine card, and a driver card. After 4 rounds, all the players show their race car for that race. The strength is the sum of the 4 played cards. The stronger the combination, the higher your finish place. In case of a tie, the value of the driver decides. Whenever you cannot make a complete car, you cannot take part in that race. When your coach-work, tires, and engine have the same value, the combination is worth 21 points, in spite of their original value. Then you add the value of the driver. When your driver is also of the same value, the total combination is worth 28 points.&#10;&#10;When it's your turn, you can choose one of the following actions:&#10;&#10;     1. Discard 1 of your cards (face up) and draw 2 new ones. The new cards can be drawn from the visible cards or from the closed pile. The 4 open piles are sorted by type. &#10;     2. Keep all your cards and draw 1 new card (from an open or the closed pile). &#10;&#10;&#10;So every turn you get 1 extra card. After 4 turns you have 8 cards, from which you must build your race car. The other 4 cards are used in the next round. Whenever you draw a card from one of the open piles, it is always the top one. From the type you just handed in, you cannot draw a new one from that type's open pile. At the start of each round, as many scoring cards are revealed as there are players. The winner gets the highest card and so on. Every player receives points, unless you cannot take part in the race. As soon as all scoring cards are used, the racing season is over. The player with the highest total of scoring cards wins the season (and the game).&#10;&#10;",

Players play robot parts into stacks, with all five energy types forming them. Action cards to attack and defend are based on the number of stacks.

All Salvagers have different abilities, so choose carefully.&#10;&#10;How To Win: Be the first player to complete Two Robots, or eliminate all opponents.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Horse racing game released by Hasbro and NBC (Yes, the US Television company) in a format nearly identical to the 3M plastic &quot;wrap-around&quot; boards.&#10;&#10;The Home Stretch is a horse racing game. The players represent the owners and jockeys of the horses in the race and the people betting on the race.&#10;&#10;To start the game, each player is given a certain amount of cash. This money is used to bid on horses. Each horse is represented by an &quot;Ownership Card&quot; which shows the horse's name, stable and &quot;Speed&quot;. Speed is used to determine the likelihood of gaining an &quot;Advantage&quot; during the race. Bidding for each horse lasts three rounds and the high bidder gets the horse.&#10;&#10;Once the horses have been assigned their starting positions are determined and the Ownership Cards are placed in the &quot;Readout Machine&quot;. This is a tray which holds the cards and will be used to determine movement. After all the horses are in the tray &quot;Odds Cards&quot; are placed below each Ownership Card. Odds Cards will determine the actual movement of each horse.&#10;&#10;Players may now make wagers on any horse they choose. Wagers may be made on any number of horses and may be made for Win, Place or Show. The player records their bets on a &quot;Betting Slip&quot; and places it face down on the board, then pays the total amount of the bets.&#10;&#10;To run the race the spinner is used to generate a random number. This number is used on the Readout Machine to determine the number of spaces moved and the &quot;Diagonal Allowance&quot; for each horse. Each Odds card has a column of numbers for total movement and a second column for Diagonal allowance. The Diagonal Allowance is the number of diagonal moves the horse may make and is therefore the number of times the horse can change lanes. The horse must use all of its movement but does not have to use all of its allowed lane changes.  The spinner's random number determines which row of numbers on the Odds cards will be used in the current round for moving the horses along the track.&#10;&#10;Sometimes the spinner will indicate &quot;Advantage&quot;. When this happens an Advantage card is drawn. Advantage Cards each show the name of one horse and that horse is allowed a free move of 6 with a diagonal allowance of 2. Other horses may not move. The better a horse's speed, the more Advantage Cards that horse has in the deck.&#10;&#10;The race continues until all of the horses have crossed the finish line. If more than one horse crosses the line in the same turn the horse which moves the furtherest past the finish line is the winner. The second and third place horse is determined the same way.&#10;&#10;Once all the horses have crossed the finish line the betting slips are revealed and winning wagers are paid. The players then set up the horses and the Readout Machine for the next race. Ownership of the horses remains the same but the starting order and Odds Cards change.&#10;&#10;A total of six races are run. The player with the most cash at the end of all six races is the winner.&#10;&#10;This is a very good game. Players can spend a good deal of money buying the best horses at the start of the game, but they then have less cash to place bets with. Meanwhile, other players can bet on their horses anyway. Also, the randomness of the appearance of the Advantage Cards mean that a good horse can have a bad showing and the slowest horse may come from behind to win. There is nothing to prevent a player from betting on another horse and racing theirs badly to influence the outcome but the other players may be doing the same thing and the fact that six races are run means that no one is likely to try it more than once (though it may show up as a race 6 strategy). A very interesting game.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Killing Code: Venice Vendetta is a cooperative reasoning game in which the players must work together to discover the identity of a killer in the city before it is too late. One player acts as the killer, secretly assuming the identity of one of the citizens of Venice and looking for opportunities to kill some of the others. The other players act together to unmask the killer's identity. Within the round limit, the killer must keep their identity hidden and complete their killings, while the other players must investigate the murder methods to discover clues leading to the killer's unmasking and stop these atrocities.&#10;&#10;Aside from the standard game mode, the game includes five scenarios that can provide players with more rules and story experiences.&#10;&#10;Game Playing:&#10;&#10;Stage 1: Flip Over Cards:&#10;&#10;At the start of this stage, the killer takes all the character cards still in play, shuffles them face down and places the pile in front of him.&#239;&#188;&#136;In the first round of a normal game, this will be all 13 character cards, reduced each round when the killer takes victims).&#10;Deal a number of character cards according to the number of players, then flip those cards face-up and place them in area easily reached by all players.  These will be the character cards availible for use this round.&#10;&#10;Stage 2: The Investigators Act&#10;Starting with the investigator to the left of the killer, that player chooses one of the availible character cards for this round and places it face-up in front of him or herself.  Once a character card has been placed in front of a player no other investigator may choose that card.  After placing the card infront of him or herself, the investigator can move that character according to the movement value on the card and one active ability on the card.  After the investigator finishes moving his or her chosen character and taking any actions, the next investigator clockwise repeats this process until all investigators have taken a character card.&#10;&#10;Stage 3: The Killer Acts&#10;The killer's stage consists of 2 parts: movement and murder.&#10;-Movement-&#10;The killer can choose from 2 options for movement&#239;&#188;&#154;&#10;&#10;     Use the remaining 2 character cards unchosen by the non-killer players.  The killer chooses what order to use these cards in.&#10;     Use 1 card in front of a non-killer player.&#10;&#10;&#10;After the killer has taken his or her movement action(s), he or she is ready to take a life.&#10;-Murder-&#10;The killer selects a killing code card from his or her hand, using its ability to end the lives of one or more characters based on the qualifications of the killing code card text.  Each round the killer can only make use of 1 killing code card.  Please refer to the killing code card section of this rulebook for further clarification.  The killer dons the mask, dramatically announces who will die, then lays that character's marker down in the block they were just alive in.  Search the character cards for the character killed and place that card face up on the grave marker from this round, then the killer places the killing code card that he or she used face down on top of that character card.  If multiple characters were killed at once, place them all on the same grave before placing the killing code card over them.&#10;&#10;Accusation Round&#10;After the killer has successfully killed 5 or more characters or has used 5 killing code cards, the game immediately enters a special final round called the accusation round.&#10;The final round is an additional round which only has the first 2 stages, the killer will not take any action in this round, instead he or she should don the mask, steeple his or her hands and watch the proceedings dramatically. When the investigators are finished moving in this round, they must immediately make an accusation.  The investigators may only accuse one suspect.  Various methods of reaching an agreement on this accusation include&#239;&#188;&#154;&#10;&#10;     Discussion&#10;     Voting&#10;     Arm Wrestling&#10;     Drinking Contest&#10;     Giving in to the Most Persuasive Who-Donnit Speech&#10;     Being Generally Louder than the Other Investigators&#10;     Agree with the Person you Secretly Find Attractive&#10;     Bribing, Coercing, or Torturing the Killer&#10;&#10;&#10;Or any additional methods which the design company assumes no responsibility for the consequences of.&#10;Or whatever, you know, it doesn't matter, just guess.&#10;&#10;Faced with this accusation, the killer must flip up his or her suspect card with a flourish.&#10;&#10;Victory or Defeat&#10;Complete the Accusation&#10;So close, yet so far very very wrong...&#10;No matter when it is made, if the accusation was correct, the investigators win.&#10;If the accusation was wrong, the killer wins.&#10;&#10;",

(Why don't townspeople want the gold themselves? I'm hesitant to ask.) In order to move the giant, though, you must pay him a landscape card to match the land through which you're moving.

    "description": "The Sioux and Cheyenne Indians were increasingly hostile to the prospectors pouring across North and South Dakota. Chief Sitting Bull gathered a force, by the Little Big Horn river, just north of the Montana-Wyoming border, ready to strike. Three columns of US Cavalry were dispatched to subdue the Indians.&#10;&#10;Now you can re-live this historic battle, and you can plan your own strategy. Can you find a way to get Custer, or at least his flag, clear of the battlefield?&#10;&#10;This game is based on the well known battle of Little Big Horn, where some united Native Americans won against General Custer's 7th cavalry. A simple game combining luck and strategy with different mechanics for different units.&#10;&#10;Movements and terrain effects are similar to wargames. Horses move faster than foot units and wearing a gun enables some ranged attacks.&#10;&#10;Winning conditions are different for the 2 opponents: Custer's men can either eliminate all Native American riders or cross the Little Big Horn River and try to reach one of 2 winning spaces on the board, the Native Americans must eliminate general Custer and his 2 officers.&#10;&#10;It was published by Rojas y Malaret in Spain, as the 3rd game in the GBM series at the end of 1952. The game was licenced and published by Hausser (Germany) in 1963. Later, the Waddingtons (UK) version in 1964 and the Capi&eacute;pa (France) version in 1965 could be non-authorized versions.&#10;&#10;",

Find somebody you disagree with and score points!  Find somebody you agree with and high-five you have found some common ground to chat about later.&#10;&#10;Each round there is a moderator who must choose a topic within a given category. Each player then forms their opinion (Like/Dislike) based on the selected topic and orients their secret opinion device accordingly. Then each player will participate in connecting their device with another player, and the active player scores points if the connected devices show that players disagree. points each round if both players disagree. The last two players must predict if their connection will agree or disagree as their method of scoring points. If you pay attention to the round, you may be able to intuit or deduce the Agree/Disagree logic connection on your turn from the previous connections.&#10;&#10;Agree to Disagree works as an icebreaker in a cold room, with family and friends, or with your gaming group. The game adapts to how well you know each by giving players a lot of control over the subject matter. The game is casually competitive at 4-8 players, and cooperative yet challenging at 2-3 players.  Instead of copying other party game formats, Agree to Disagree brings a fresh new feel to the genre through a hot-potato turn order.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Line or Colour is a combinatorial game for two players. Originally named Tangion (a contraction for Tangent+Tension), the game involves two perpendicular winning conditions that can tie players&acute; brains in knots. It was derived from Domina 4 by adding a n-in-a-row victory condition and removing piece movement.&#10;&#10;The name was later changed to the more friendly Line or Colour.&#10;&#10;MATERIAL&#10;&#10;49 rounded counters in 7 colours (7 each)&#10;25 white rings&#10;25 black rings&#10;The official edition includes a board for faster setup.&#10;&#10;RULES&#10;&#10;There are 2 types of gameplay: basic and advanced.&#10;&#10;Basic version:&#10;&#10;Arrange 25 counters in 5 colours (5 each) in a square according to the figure:&#10;&#10;12345&#10;45123&#10;23451&#10;51234&#10;34512&#10;&#10;Player 'White' (Starting player) takes all the white rings. Player 'Black' takes all the black rings.&#10;&#10;Starting with 'White' players alternate turns 'claiming' a counter by placing a ring of their colour on it. The pie rule is enabled.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player either forms a row of at least 4 consecutive rings of his colour (orthogonal or diagonal) or has claimed 4 counters of the same colour. That player wins the game.&#10;&#10;Advanced version:&#10;&#10;Arrange 49 counters in 7 colours (7 each) according to the figure:&#10;&#10;1234567&#10;6712345&#10;4567123&#10;2345671&#10;7123456&#10;5671234&#10;3456712&#10;&#10;Same rules apply, but a player wins by making a line of 5 or claiming 5 counters of the same colour.

To celebrate this landmark moment in law enforcement, I have erected eight gallows on Main Street: seven for the execution of this thieving, murderous band, and one for good luck.

As a crowd is expected, I've reserved prime seating for you, my most honored guests and dear friends. You shall be served a sumptuous meal in my home prior to our thrilling main event, which will begin with the hanging of the mysterious masked horseman who masterminded the Seven's unsavory crimes. So, leave your affairs in order, and come join me in this triumphant celebration.

    "description": "Black Death is the game of plagues for 2 to 6 players. Each player is a different strain of disease in 14th century Europe, and whoever racks up the highest body count wins. The map is based on the trade routes and major population centers of Europe at the time, the events are based on historical events, and the rules are interspersed with grim quotes from the survivors. It is a game of conquest and strategy, just a different sort of conquest than your average wargame.&#10;&#10;Component list: Black Death includes color and greyscale 15 x 20 inch maps (tiled for normal printers and single sheet for large format printers), six disease tracks, 150 counters, two player aid sheets and twenty event cards. It will take anywhere from half an hour to an hour to assemble it, depending on the work you put into it.&#10;&#10;Play notes: Black Death is unusual in that it is a kind of conquest and area control game, but your score is based on infected populations dying off, which removes your counters from play. So you are simultaneously gaining ground in one spot and choosing to lose it in another. Depending on the Virulence and Mortality of your particular strain of a disease, the strategies you can use will vary. The game can be played with 2 people, but like most games of this sort, it works best with 3 or more.&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Black Death&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Yahtzee meets a board game.  Players move pawns around a board with 12 open spaces and 4 'wild' spaces.  If you land on an open space, you can try to complete one of the 12 standard Yahtzee combinations (not counting the 'Yahtzee' -- more on that later).  If successful, you place the card for that combination on the space and a certain number of your chips to signify ownership.  If another player lands on that space later, they have to match or beat your roll to steal ownership of the board space.  Once a combination has been assigned to a space, it stays there -- so the number of combinations available to fill a blank space on the board decreases throughout the game.  If a player lands on a 'Wild' space, they can try for any combination, then move their piece to the appropriate space and steal ownership.  Also, if a player gets a Yahtzee, they can ignore the space they're on and claim ownership of any space on the board.  Once all combinations have been claimed, each player gets one more turn in which they're allowed to keep playing as long as they keep stealing ownership of a card.  Whoever has the most chips on the board at the end of the game wins.  A very interesting twist on the classic Yahtzee mechanism.&#10;&#10;",

The players must visit the slave traders and traveling merchants to create his own city, while plotting to overrun his neighbor's.&#10;&#10;There are four merchants to choose from, each one with diverse goods of his specialty:&#10;&#10;1) Civilians&#10;2) Soldiers&#10;3) Weapons&#10;4) Items&#10;&#10;Each player has a playing area of 2 rows of 5 cards. The castle is located behind the last row, in the center. Players can deploy up to 10 units into these spaces. Each turn, a player goes through the following phases:&#10;&#10;1. Act &#10;2. Deploy &#10;3. Attack &#10;4. Pay &#10;5. Buy &#10;6. Discard and Draw&#10;&#10;In these phases, a player&#10;1) can choose one action allowance and can execute any one card with an action on it, &#10;2) can choose to deploy a unit onto his board to improve defense and/or economy, &#10;3) can choose to attack another player to cripple their board or even to win the game by destroying their castle, &#10;4) must pay the upkeep cost of all cards currently on his board, &#10;5) can use the remaining income for the turn to visit a traveling merchant and buy more advanced units, items or weapons, and finally &#10;6) must discard his entire hand and draw a new one.&#10;&#10;The combat stage of the game occurs when a player attacks, and the two players at war will have 5 fronts lined up, with a dice driven mechanic to determine which units will attack. While wars are often unpredictable, a poorly equipped militia would never stand up to an elite force! The constant threat of attack means every player must balance their military needs with their economic ones, fielding an army that's large enough to fend off attackers, yet small enough to avoid draining the economy.&#10;&#10;",

Combat is resolved by dice rolls.

The game is an update of SPI&rsquo;s East Is Red game, specifically showing the developments in warfare that have occurred in the intervening decades, and projected out to the near future. Both side&rsquo;s armed forces are smaller than they were during the Cold War, but have access to modern high-tech weapons and tactics, termed in the game as Hyperwar.&#10;&#10;Dragon vs Bear: China vs Russia in the 21st Century is operational level with two players: One for China and one for Russia. It puts players in the position of having to utilize the full spectrum of military operations, which also include weapons of mass destruction. The game is played in scenarios, each postulating different reasons for the war, as well as different levels of mobilization. You win by defeating the enemy and gaining national objectives.&#10;&#10;The game emphasizes land and airpower. Naval warfare is factored out on the premise that the Chinese and Russian navies would cancel each other out for the period that the game scenarios covered.&#10;&#10;Conventional land and airpower are treated in a generally similar manner. This is in part because of the lack of sophisticated higher level airpower doctrines in the Chinese and Russian armed forces, but also because of the range and lethality of modern munitions: firepower is going to be the same whether delivered by a multiple rocket launcher system, an attack helicopter, or a jet bomber. The real difference will come in with the application of Hyperwar capabilities. Hyperwar is inherent in certain unit types, and can be assigned to others via Hyperwar strikes.&#10;&#10;",

But other enemy rodents will do anything they can to stop you from climbing that tree and snatching those precious snacks.&#10;&#10;To claim a nut card in Get Nuts, a player must move his squirrel down a trail composed of four cards in order to reach the nut stash in the center of the table. Squirrels don't just saunter down shady paths, however, so you need to play tree cards on the path to give the squirrel a way to navigate toward the nuts. On a turn, a player has four action points available, with which he can play cards from his hand (which cost 0-4 points) or advance his squirrel down the trees on his trail, with each space costing a point. At the end of a player's turn, he can discard any number of cards he wants, then refill his hand to five cards.&#10;&#10;Cards can either help you or attack opponents. Use a sacred tree to provide a safe haven that others can't destroy, and place the Divine Nut on your path, a special treat that can be claimed only after taking a nut from the stash. Take chainsaws and flamethrowers to opponents' trees, or send a bullzoer up their trail to demolish trees one by one over several turns. If your squirrel sits in a tree that's felled, it moves back down the trail and will remain injured until you take the time to administer first aid and get the little guy up and running once again.&#10;&#10;If you claim a nut, your squirrel scampers back to the start of the trail, and you must remove trees from your trail equal to the value of that nut. (Trees wither from loneliness when they lose their nuts.) The game ends once the last nut card has been claimed, and the player with the most valuable stash wins.&#10;&#10;",

The surprise attack was executed as planning by two Panzer groups, commanded by Colonel Generals Hoth and Guderian. The Soviet commander of the Western Front forces, General Pavlov, was taken completely by surprise, and, by order of the Soviet Supreme Command, dispatched his mobile forces directly into the German pincers. Most of the Soviet forces, including the mobile reserves, were thrown into disarray by the German first strike and were eliminated piecemeal.&#10;&#10;On June 28 the Germans closed their first major pocket of the war in the east. It extended from Belostok (Bialystok) to Minsk. 287,000 Soviet troops surrendered in this pocket, and in addition 2585 tanks and 1449 guns were captured. By July 3 the German forces had swept Belorussia of Soviet resistance with the single exception of the garrison at the fortress at Brest. From there they drove on to their next objectives of Smolensk and the Dnieper River, and from there towards Moscow.&#10;&#10;Army Group Center is a two player game in which one player controls the German forces, the other the Soviet.&#10;&#10;The game is presented in three separate scenarios, the first historical, the second and third hypothetical. The historical scenario is largely a one-sided affair and should be played by those wishing to glean the historical lessons of the German blitzkrieg campaign. For those wishing more balanced play, the second and third scenarios are recommended in which a hypothetical situation is postulated where the Soviets were aware of the German invasion plans and had prepared accordingly.&#10;&#10;Army Group Center was published by 3W in 1993. The Japanese edition is published by Masahiro Yamazaki with improved components; both of counters and game-map. The English edition for the revised edition is provided and may be downloaded.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 12 hours&#10;Hex: 6.25 miles / 10 kilometers&#10;Units: Regiment to Division&#10;&#10;Game Inventory (3W):&#10;One 22 x 34&quot; full color mapsheet&#10;Three dual-side printed countersheets (500 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 20-page Army Group Center rulebook&#10;Four Player Aid charts&#10;One 10-sided die&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: High&#10;Complexity Level: Medium-High&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 5 hours&#10;&#10;Components (Six Angles edition)&#10;&#10;     One magazine booklet&#10;     One 22&quot; x 34&quot; game map&#10;     Four counter sheets (528 counters)&#10;     Two charts and tables&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Their appearance often troubled the Dutch colonial government as they were master of Silat (local martial art) and refuse to bow down to the government. They were called heroes by the local citizens at the time.&#10;&#10;The story revolves around Mat Goceng, a local Vrije man, that vowed to always save the weak and drive the Dutch away from his land. He then met Nyi Kencleng, a rich merchant from the land of Pasundan (west Java), and helped her build a Padepokan Silat. A place where everybody can learn Silat for free. Some people then tried to stop Mat Goceng made his dream into realization.&#10;&#10;Mat Goceng is a card game that can be played by 3-6 players. The game mechanism consists of deduction (guessing who is the ally or enemy), bluffing (avoid being attacked), card management (to produce the longest hit combo), and persuasion (persuade other people to ask help from you). The active player chooses which person he/she will attack. Then both of them alternately will try to build their own combo to defend and attack. They can ask for help from the inactive players; the cost of helping is negotiable. The longest combo win the battle. Then, the player on the left (of the active player) then proceed as the new active player.&#10;&#10;The objective of the game depends on which character the player will have in the beginning of the game. As example, if you have Mat Goceng&rsquo;s card then the winning condition is to make sure both you and Nyi Kencleng survives until the end of the game. Meanwhile Nyi Kencleng&rsquo;s objective is to survive the game and collect more money than the other players. There are total of six characters with different objectives.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Fighting Sail: Fleet Actions 1775&ndash;1815 is a tabletop miniatures wargame of fleet battles in the age of canvas, cannon, and timbers. Players take on the roles of fleet admirals in battles ranging from the American War of Independence to the Napoleonic Wars and the War of 1812. Each fleet has access to different ships, tactics, and command personalities - each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Offering a unique blend of detail and simplicity, the scenarios included enable the recreation of historic actions or 'what-if' scenarios.&#10;&#10;The rules are designed for 1/1200 scale ship miniatures, although they can be easily adjusted for smaller scales. Game focus is on ships of 6th Rate or above. The game is hex-less, so uses movement and turning templates along with a tape measure or ruler.  Combat and other tests utilize a pool of six-sided dice.&#10;&#10;Fighting Sail was designed with a crew-centric approach and has a goal of immersion over simulation. To perform actions players roll a number of dice based on crew and ship capability to test against a target number.  More successes return a better result (more movement, more hits in combat, more damage saves, etc.). The goal of the game is to break the enemy fleet by reducing their morale to zero.  Morale can be lost by taking damage, suffering a collision, or when a ship is taken out of action (by striking, being sunk, or captured in a boarding action).&#10;&#10;The Fighting Sail rules include a points-based system for building fleets and balancing scenarios.  The ship/crew capabilities and special rules for eight fleets are detailed in the book (including privateers and pirates).  Six general engagement scenarios are described to get prospective admirals started on their journey into the adventurous age of fighting sail.&#10;&#10;",

On a turn, a player rolls all six dice, then sets aside any dice that have a value equal to or less than the similarly-colored die on the target card. For example, if the card has a blue die showing a 4, then any value from 1 to 4 on the blue die would be valid and set aside. The player can stop and score points equal to the sum of his valid dice or roll the invalid dice. If he rolls at least one valid die, he sets that aside and can choose to stop or roll again; if he rolls no valid dice, then he scores points equal to all the dice on the target card for which no die was set aside. Set aside five dice, and you score an extra five points; set aside all six, and your score for the round is doubled. Whoever has the most points after ten rounds wins the game.&#10;&#10;Fiese 15 includes 15 target cards, with only ten being used each game. The target cards are double-sided, with only five dice showing on the opposite side, allowing players to choose a variant that handicaps the leaders with tougher targets.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Isi is a colorful abstract strategy game played on two levels.  On a basic level, each player is moving a pawn around the island of Isi, picking up tokens - there's a little strategy here, because which tokens you pick up are important, and one player's pawn can interfere with the other's.  But on another level, players are spending those tokens to build 'trade routes' between cities on the same island.  Cities grow as they become connected by trade routes, and at the end of the game whichever city's grown the most becomes the capital city; whoever is connected the most to the capital wins the game.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Morisi&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Brent Ward&#10;Developer: Barry Kendall&#10;&#10;Red Menace is a solitaire wargame pitting the strategic nuclear and defensive forces of the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom against those of the Soviet Union and its client state, Cuba, in 1959. The game focuses primarily on the role of strategic bombers, but other types of supporting aircraft such as Interceptors, Airborne Early Warning aircraft, and Aerial Refueling Tankers are also represented.&#10;&#10;The term &quot;Red Menace&quot; was used during the Cold War by the U.S. because it was believed that thousands of Soviet bombers could be unleashed at a moment's notice. This turned out not to be true as the Soviets had several hundred bombers at best, and many had significant range limitations. The game is not meant to be an accurate simulation of the actual capabilities of the strategic forces involved, but rather reflects what the governments and citizens of the U.S., Canada, and the UK believed could happen.&#10;&#10;Each turn consists of fifteen phases played in order from drawing random events, deploying and moving Soviet flights, intercepting flights, submarine operations and more. Reference sheets are included to make tracking the game progress easier. Decisions for the Soviet units are made by the game system using random events and dice. The player simply moves the Soviet bombers towards their assigned targets. Scenarios are included with various starting positions, targets, and actions for Soviet, United States, and United Kingdom bombers.&#10;&#10;The game complexity is easy, but optional rules are included to make it more challenging. The winner of a scenario is determined by the points scored from attacking the opponent's cities. Points are awarded by a random chit draw after each successful attack. A typical scenario requires fifty points to win.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "In Regnum, the kingdoms with the most inhabitants and the best resources are the most prosperous. In this game you must get the most valuable characters to settle around your castle. You will have to develop your strategy by taking into account the advantage of your castle and the standards.&#10;&#10;Be wary of the other castles, as they will all want to steal your best characters. Will you be able to make your kingdom the most prosperous and proclaim yourself victorious?&#10;&#10;Each player receives a castle card at random and places it in front of them. Each castle has a particular advantage that must be used wisely.&#10;&#10;Randomly put the number of standard on the table that is equal to the number of players plus one (3 banners for 2 players, 4 for 3 and so on). The standards are displayed for everyone to see and will be scored at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Next, shuffle the character cards and place them face down to form a deck. Next, turn over the first 4 and line them up next to the deck. These are the inhabitants available for populating your kingdom.&#10;&#10;Shuffle the resource cards and deal 4 cards to each player. The rest are left face down on the table in a deck, on the other side of the character line-up. The first card is turned over and used to start the discard pile. The player with the most regal bearing starts.&#10;&#10;How the game works&#10;&#10;The person whose turn it is must perform these two actions in the following order:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Draw resource cards. You can choose to draw two resource cards from the top of the deck (unseen) or take the top card from the discard pile.&#10;     Add a character to your realm. To do this, select one of the available characters and pay for it by discarding cards from your hand that show the resources indicated. If you can do this, take the character from the line and place it in front of you. This makes them an inhabitant of your realm. If you cannot, or do not want to add a character to your realm, you must discard a resource card from your hand. You can buy as many characters as your resources allow.&#10;&#10;&#10;Each character has a resource cost and an effect on the game that is shown on the card. This effect must be implemented immediately after acquiring that character. Caution: some characters affect other cards.&#10;&#10;At the end of your turn you must always replace any characters that have been bought from the line-up on the table by taking more cards from the character deck. This way, there will always be four characters available for the next player. &emsp;&#10;&#10;The game ends when there are no cards left in one of the two decks (either resources or characters). When the last card is drawn, a final round is played.&#10;&#10;Once the round is over, each bonus score standard is assigned to the player who best fulfils its condition. If there is a tie, no one wins that standard (unless you have Montreaux Castle). Each standard won adds 3 points to the final score.&#10;&#10;To find out who the winner is, the players must add up the points earned by the characters in their realm plus the points awarded by any standards they have won.&#10;&#10;If the final score is tied, the player with the most inhabitants in their kingdom wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

A piece of string is passed through these tiles and knots are made at the 3, 5 and 6 feet marks. A record sheet inserted in a clear holder shows ship characteristics and a grease marker is used to mark damage.&#10;&#10;Players physically move their ships by measuring distance with a ruler.
