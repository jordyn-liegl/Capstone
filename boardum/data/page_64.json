The battlefield consists of six lanes, each with three sectors, radiating out from the tower. On these lanes, the orcish hordes will try to charge all the way towards the tower. Your job is to defeat them before they can reach you.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of each game round players draw a fate card, which will determine which category of creatures will advance one sector towards the tower and sometimes implement a nasty rule change for that particular game round. There are three categories of orcs which differ in strength and special abilities that are conveyed to a player once an orc is defeated.&#10;&#10;The game ends when you run out of orcs on one of the four lanes. During the final scoring, players count up their defeated orcs and multiply them by the number on the creature counter, get points for each support spell learned and subtract points for each poison card in their deck. Whoever has the most points will be declared &quot;Master Mage&quot;!&#10;&#10;",

The game includes wooden segments that the players can add to cards to adjust their value. The amount of unused segments a player has will determine their bid for the round.&#10;&#10;For instance, a segment placed horizontally across a &quot;0&quot; will create an &quot;8&quot;.

They will score for both the tricks taken as well as segment pieces that were played on cards in those tricks.

    "description": "Myrgos, the powerful and benevolent Dragon King has passed into the next world after an extended illness, and the land is now gripped with uncertainty.&nbsp;As the laws of succession dictate, only one of his remaining apprentices can rise to the position of &quot;Draco Magi&quot;.&#10;&#10;With the death of the Draco Magi, the wizard-lock on the succession strongbox of each apprentice has completely dissipated. Inside each box, an apprentice will find a succession scroll. Contained on the scroll is the last piece of knowledge required to become the Drago Magi &mdash; but only one can claim the title. Each scroll holds a different &quot;Spell of Succession&quot; that may be executed only with the correct combination of rare gems. These magically imbued gems appear in sets of three only during times of succession and must be collected by dragons at the command of each apprentice. The competitor who is first to collect the gems needed to complete his Spell of Succession becomes the new Drago Magi. For the loser, the unofficial title whispered under the breath of the people is &quot;Novitius Eterna&quot; or &quot;Forever a Novice&quot;.&#10;&#10;Be swift and remember, there is little room for error.&#10;&#10;Draco Magi is a card game designed by Richard Launius and Robert Burke. To start, each player selects an apprentice dragon mage he wishes to play. Each mage receives a deck of dragon cards that includes multiple copies of four different chromatic dragons (Green, Red, Black &amp; Purple), four different metallic dragons (Gold, Silver, Brass &amp; Bronze), and two special dragon cards (the Battle dragon and the Polar dragon). Each dragon has a different strength, weakness and special ability. Players will send their dragons, one at a time, to capture gems on different battlefields; each battlefield offers a different effect that may give an advantage or disadvantage to certain types of dragons.&#10;&#10;Players alternate playing dragon cards on battlefields until they have played all eight of their Dragon cards. Each player can play a maximum of three dragons on a single battlefield. When a dragon is placed, it may make a ranged attack. Not all dragons have a ranged attack breath weapon, but those that do have a breath weapon icon with a number. The number indicates the number of battle cards the player may reveal when attempting to hit with a ranged attack. A defender may defend with the number of cards equal to the dragon's shield value. A ranged attack can take place immediately only when the card is played against an opposing dragon. If a ranged attack is not used at this moment, the ranged attack is forfeited for the current round.&#10;&#10;After all dragon cards have been played, the melee phase of the battle begins. Each dragon has a &quot;melee attack&quot; value printed on its card which represents the number of battle cards the player can draw for the battle. The melee battle mechanism is a unique attack and counter system that provides opportunity for deduction, subtlety, and deadly combos. Players will also earn advance battle cards that build up their decks over the course of the game. The player with the most dragons present on a battlefield wins that gem. In the case of a tie, the dragons and gem remain for the next round.&#10;&#10;Draco Magi is a fast game heavily connected to its theme that incorporates area control, bluffing, hand management, deck building and deduction.&#10;&#10;",

The cards represent 4 different types of valuable goods and caravan handlers.&#10;&#10;Gold is collected along the path and at the midpoint of the game and the end (when the first player reaches Kantschou and then Daidu). The player reaching Kantschou first receives 6 gold, anyone in the next space receives 5 gold, and so on down to 1 gold. After the first scoring round, all players start together again at Kantschou. The first player to reach Daidu receives 7 gold, next space 6, then 5 and so on.&#10;&#10;Play is by matching cards from hand to requirements in next free space (e.g. one of each good or 3 cards the same colour). Caravans tend to leap frog forward, so one player's move changes the requirements for the next. In each turn, a player may move as often as they can match from their hand. For those really stuck with a poor hand, 1 gold will move your caravan one place forward, but only so long as they aren't the leading caravan.&#10;&#10;At the end of each turn, the active player draws one of five face-up cards or a random card from the draw pile to replenish their hand.&#10;&#10;The player with the most gold at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;",

Special units such as airmobile, airborne, and amphibious troops, with their abilities to outflank a line, become even more important.&#10;Another important feature is the tangled web of Balkan politics, Romania is the least reliable of the Pact countries, and its participation is half-hearted at best. A second scenario allows for its total neutrality, forcing the Soviets to reinforce their armies and invade before taking on NATO. Greece and Turkey are uneasy allies, and rules allow for Greek withdrawal from NATO. And Albania is completely unpredictable.&#10;&#10;Additional rules allow Southern Front to be combined with The Third World War: Battle for Germany; players can reinforce one front with forces from the other, requiring a host of new decisions on the strategic level. One or two new divisions or air units sent to the Balkans can turn the tide there, but at what cost to the main front, where every unit is desperately needed ?&#10;&#10;",

Within a day, one third of Spain was under the control of Nationalist forces attempting to stage a military coup.

Players must be concerned about the position of their forces on the board, but the composition of a player's hand will affect their success in combat more often than not. Plays with two, four, or six players split into two teams. Players each have an identical 20-card deck (with unique, original propaganda posters actually used in the war) that results in the use of your cards being more important than the luck of the draw.

    "description": "Politics year to year in the early American republic. Play begins with George Washington as president, with Vice President John Adams. Each player controls several statesmen as well as others who will appear, up through the arrival of Abraham Lincoln. Together the players try to solve the issues faced by the young republic -- wars, debt, financial panics, the growth of the Union, north-south division, and more. Every four years the most popular politicians from each party square off to see who becomes the next president.&#10;&#10;Somewhat similar to The Republic of Rome, but with many modifications to suit the topic, including a completely different way of resolving elections and a more nuanced treatment of Issue cards (rather than simply Wars), plus novelties such as the Public Support Track, spendable Influence, political parties, more offices, tax cards, counterfactual events and an ever-expanding map of the United States.&#10;&#10;If diplomacy is not your cup of tea, a variant printed in the rules removes all requirements to negotiate and makes it a matter of cardplay, drafting and utilization of resources.&#10;&#10;Living rules available: https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/founding-fathers:-green-edition&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "That Scorpion of the Sea: Malta Besieged is a solitaire game covering the pivotal World War II years of the mid-1940 through 1942 period in the often overlooked Battle for the Mediterranean. You are placed in the role of the Commonwealth Commander in the theatre, and must utilize every resource at your disposal to fend off unrelenting Axis attacks in order to ensure the survival of the island of Malta.&#10;&#10;Built upon the same States of Siege engine as the designer's previous 2010 Charles S. Roberts award-winning release (We Must Tell the Emperor), Malta Besieged features both familiar and innovative game play. Supply was the key element in the Mediterranean Campaign, and so it is here as well. Players will have to safely shepherd vulnerable convoys - and their valuable cargoes - in order to effectively wage war. With the ability to trade Supply for extra Actions at the most crucial moments, this places an additional emphasis on that precious resource and also creates extremely tense convoy battles which will resolve as the game progresses.&#10;&#10;ULTRA is a crucial asset in the game, but beware of Axis counterintelligence! Spitfires can rule the skies, Gibraltar can block U-Boat advances, Operation Herkules is a constant threat, and Admiral Cunningham himself can intervene on occasion.&#10;&#10;North Africa is not treated as a mere sideshow; indeed, the struggle with Rommel, the &quot;Desert Fox&quot;, holds the ultimate key to victory... if Malta can hold out against the constant pressure. If a fortified Tobruk manages to stubbornly delay the vaunted Afrika Korps long enough, then General Montgomery and his battle-tested 8th Army can possibly make a final dash from El Alamein to capture Tripoli and secure a glorious triumph.&#10;&#10;Raiding Axis supply lines to weaken Rommel's Situation, scrambling Hurricanes to provide Air Support for inbound shipping, attacking the Italians early before the dreaded Luftwaffe arrives, requesting British Fleet escort for your individually named convoys, and maintaining the morale of a battered Malta are just some of the important decisions to be made throughout the game. Numerous theatre-wide events such as The Fall of France, O'Connor's desert offensive, the daring raid on the Italian Fleet at Taranto, the Air Assault on Crete, the evacuation from Greece, the sinking of the aircraft carrier Ark Royal, and the Torch landings are all abstracted via card play, and can have a significant impact on the overall conduct of the war.&#10;&#10;With That Scorpion of the Sea: Malta Besieged, it's all here - the only question is will you have the wisdom, leadership, fortitude, and luck to prevail? Play this game and find out!&#10;&#10;Game Data:&#10;&#10;Complexity: 4 on a 9 scale&#10;Solitaire Suitability: 9 on a 9 scale&#10;Game Length: 75 minutes&#10;Scale: Each unit is one Axis Front, each turn is a variable number of days or weeks.&#10;&#10;NOTE: The game is currently out-of-print.&#10;&#10;",

As the tally of encirclements and surrenders mounts, the German advance appears unstoppable to Hitler and many others. However, the officers and men at the front are beginning to have serious misgivings -- not in themselves, but in the pre-war intelligence estimates that they had received. They had not been prepared to encounter hundreds of KV-1's and T-34's, tanks far superior to anything they possessed. For the moment, German tactics provided the margin of victory over better material, but the Russians were proving to be quick learners. Worse yet, by western European standards, Russian losses had been so staggering that there should have been no army left to fight. Not so. There seemed to be no end to these tenacious Russian defenders. As the German forces continued their eastward advance, more and more soldiers began asking, &quot;What have we gotten ourselves into?&quot;&#10;&#10;Kiev, the first major German objective in the south, did not fall on schedule. In fact, Soviet resistance was so fierce that it required diverting Guderian's Panzer Group away from the advance on Moscow. Kiev fell in one of the greatest encirclements of the Second World War, but the German advance on Moscow was delayed for several critical weeks. Quite possibly the delay at Kiev might have cost the German forces victory in the battle for Moscow.&#10;&#10;840 full-color two-sided counters.  &#10;MAPS   &#10;Three 22x34&quot; and one 17x22&quot; full-color mapsheets  &#10;OTHER  One 10-sided die &#10;36-page Rule Book &#10;36-page Play Book &#10;Player Aid Cards: four two-sided Soviet Set-Up cards, four two-sided Axis Set-Up cards, Soviet Status card, Axis Status card, two 11x17 two-sided game chart cards, two cards of additional scenario charts. &#10; Eight scenarios allow players to vary their level of involvement, complexity, and starting point, from introductory to full campaign &#10;An asymmetrical sequence of play that highlights Axis armored breakthroughs and Soviet difficulties in combined arms warfare &#10;Detailed air rules that integrate with land combat and weather rules &#10;Incredibly detailed orders of battle, including special coverage of artillery, rocket artillery, engineers, bridge units, armored trains, and much more &#10;Modifications to the proven Typhoon system include revised overrun and Soviet surrender procedures, as well as a new non-op Soviet HQ system to simulate the rigid yet fragile Soviet Command structure &#10;Extensive bibliography and design/historical notes&#10;&#10;Scenarios include;&#10;&#10;Scenario #1 &quot;Assault on Kiev&quot; which uses a portion of map G.

A fully cooperative, campaign-driven, miniatures board game, Wander: The Cult of Barnacle Bay tells the story of 5 heroes from the Wanderer's Guild, and their struggle to free the small fishing town of Barnacle Bay from the slimy claws of Elder Bane. Driven mad by power, and physically twisted from dark magic, Elder Bane has created a cult of mutated townsfolk that only desire to spread their message of madness to the rest of the world, bending it to their whim along the way.&#10;&#10;In Wander: The Cult of Barnacle Bay, players will select one of five unique heroes, outfit their hero with starting gear (represented by mini cards on a player dashboard), and join their friends to take back Barnacle Bay. Defeating foes and surviving random encounters earns players experience points and loot. Loot, like weapons and armor, is a persistent upgrade, staying with the heroes as they continue on their adventure. Experience points are used to level up heroes during their current adventure in the campaign. A dual-facing upgrade tree allows players to continually try new combinations of skills each adventure to determine what fits their play style, or current set of foes, best.&#10;&#10;Using a modular board, players assemble maps as indicated in the campaign book, then use action points to move or attack with their hero.&#10;&#10;All enemies in the game are controlled by a simple line of sight A.I., and automatically hit the players' heroes once they're able to. This means there is no player rolling for success for enemies' attacks. Heroes will, however, be able to roll for defense in an effort to prevent incoming wounds. One set of custom dice determines a hero's success for both defending and attacking. Random encounter cards, which are revealed when players enter an  unexplored &quot;darkness&quot; space, also promise that no campaign adventure is ever be the same.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

This new edition is quite different from Dean Essig's original game from back in 2000. It features a revised order of battle, modified rules, and a new map. The most obvious change is in scale: hexes are now 3.5 miles across and there are two turns per week (the original had 2.5-mile hexes and four turns per week). This makes for a smaller, faster game that conforms to the scale chosen for Beyond the Rhine: The Campaign for Northwest Europe and the upcoming games set in Western Europe. We think Sicily II is a perfect way to give new recruits their baptism in the fire of OCS, and is also a worthy entry in the series for players who have already earned their stripes.&#10;&#10;Here are some of the game&rsquo;s highlights:&#10;&#10;&#10;     The entire campaign lasts just 16 turns.&#10;     There are six scenarios in all (three using the entire map, and three using just a portion).&#10;     The Allied airborne fiasco is recreated with simple scatter rules. &#10;     The amphibious landings can be played out using standard OCS naval rules, or players can mostly skip these and begin with the bulk of Allied forces already ashore.&#10;     The Luftwaffe&rsquo;s Do.217K makes its series debut, armed with exotic Fritz-X missiles.&#10;     Rules for Italian unit wavering and surrender make every game different.&#10;     Several interesting options are provided, including revised Axis deployment and variable entry of the 29th Panzergrenadier Division.&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Turn: 3 to 4 days&#10;Hex: 3.5 miles / 5.6 Km&#10;Units: Company to Brigade&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;&#10;    One 22 x 34&quot; full-color mapsheet&#10;    Two dual-side printed countersheets (560 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;    One 16-page Sicily II rules booklet&#10;&#10;&#10;Players will have to use OCS v4.2 rulebook/charts &amp; tables for another OCS game or download them from http://www.gamersarchive.net/theGamers/archive/ocs.htm&#10;&#10;Complexity: Medium&#10;Solitaire Suitability: Medium&#10;Players: 1 or more&#10;Playing Time: 2-20 Hours&#10;&#10;",

Little Devils is a devilishly fun trick-taking game you keep on playing...&#10;&#10;Little Devils is a fluent trick-taking game with simple rules:&#10;&#10;    Players don't need to follow trump or suit and can play higher or lower than previously played cards.&#10;    The second card played &ndash; and not the first &ndash; determines the goal for that round.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Magically transmitted diseases (MTDs) are a powerful addition to the proceedings, leading wizards to suffer Crotch Krakens, Genital Harpies, and Gorgonorrhea, among other enchanted afflictions. MTDs also give players glyphs that lead to spells that are more epic than ever. In addition, players vie for control of the standee, which protects them from the MTDs that might come their way.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

We could be enjoying our looting in Isla Tortuga but our Captain insisted on coming to this goddamned island instead.&#10;&#10;In the meantime, our gunner &lsquo;Mad&rsquo; Harry does not stop telling us stories and legends about some fantastic creatures that dwell in this place. The Doctor seems uneasy, grabbing the hilt of his sword, sweating a lot more than usual after listening to Harry&rsquo;s tales.&#10;&#10;-Old Sanders lost his leg after having cut it himself. He escaped alive from the jaws of that shark-headed abomination in human form &hellip;- Harry was explaining at the same time he was miming with all his body doing so, acting out the scene with his eyes moving all directions as if they were about to jump off his face, in a way of magnifying the facts.&#10;&#10;-I would not like to lose my leg&hellip;or my arm, or any other limb from my body. I appreciate every single limb and organ of mine- was murmuring the Doctor who was more and more nervous. &ndash;Do you think there will be more monstrosities like those?&#10;&#10;The conversation was interrupted by the sound of two swords pulling out from their sheath together with the cracking in the wood due to a firm step.

How is that? Each character will use different abilities to solve mysteries in each scenario or island (by means of modular boards) to fulfill secondary missions; they will roll dice and play cards in order to move, fight enemies or sail depending of how many PP they still have left. All in a cooperative way to escape alive from all this because dead men tell no tales...&#10;&#10;",

Those drawn during fall and winter are advantageous for the Beast.&#10;    The Beast secretly chooses where to strike next and can use special powers (but risks being cut off that power for the rest of the game and can even risk having its identity revealed and loosing the game).&#10;    The investigators choose where they move (their presence can also protect the location from the Beast)&#10;    The Beast reveals its location and the number of victims depends on the distance traveled, the NPCs present on site, if a special power was applied and if any investigator is there or not.&#10;    Investigators present in a location visited by the Beast during the past 2 seasons can investigate its traces to see if they can cut the Beast off one of its power or even find out its secret identity.&#10;&#10;&#10;---&#10;The Beast of G&eacute;vaudan is the historic name associated with a man-eating animal (or animals) that terrorised the former province of G&eacute;vaudan (consisting of the modern-day department of Loz&egrave;re and part of Haute-Loire as well as the Auvergne and south Dordogne areas of France), in the Margeride Mountains of southern-central France between 1764 and 1767. The attacks, which covered an area spanning 90 by 80 kilometres (56 by 50 mi), were said to have been committed by one or more beasts with formidable teeth and immense tails, according to contemporary eyewitnesses. Most descriptions from the period identify the beast as a striped hyena, wolf, dog, or wolf-dog hybrid.&#10;&#10;Victims were often killed by having their throats torn out. The Kingdom of France used a considerable amount of money and manpower to hunt the animals responsible, including the resources of several nobles, soldiers, royal huntsmen, and civilians. The number of victims differs according to the source. A 1987 study estimated there had been 610 attacks, resulting in 500 deaths and 49 injuries; 98 of the victims killed were partly eaten. Other sources claim the animal or animals killed between 60 and 100 adults and children and injured more than 30. The beast was reported killed several times before the attacks finally stopped.&#10;&#10;",

On a turn, the active player voices his suspicions in the form of a sentence &ndash; &quot;I suspect ....... of having been seen at ....... at around ....... hundred in possession of .......&quot; &ndash; filling in the blanks with one of the eight possibilities in each category. All players then secretly note whether or not they hold the evidence card for one of the four things named by placing a verdict card inside a folder. The active player shuffles these folders to disguise who answered in which ways, then reveals them. If all four items guessed were false, then you cover those four guesses on the game board with Holmes' business cards; otherwise players mentally note how many of the items were correct and try to decipher which ones those might be.&#10;&#10;Players then participate in a deduction round in which each player can:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Place a deduction token on a clue.&#10;    Say &quot;I pass&quot;.&#10;    Attempt an accusation.&#10;&#10;&#10;If all players pass successively, the round ends and the next player in clockwise order then voices a suspicion. Otherwise a player can pass, then place a deduction token or attempt an accusation later in the same round.&#10;&#10;Each player has nine deduction tokens in his color, three each of 0, 1 and 2. To place a token, you place it face-down on the clue of your choice to the right of any tokens already present; if any of those tokens are face-down, you reveal those tokens. At most four tokens can be placed on a clue.&#10;&#10;To attempt an accusation, you say, &quot;I accuse (suspect) of having been been seen at (place) at around (time) in possession of (object)&quot;, then all players submit their verdict cards the same way they normally do. If all of them are positive, you've solved the case &ndash; but not necessarily won the game. All tokens on incorrect clues and all tokens belonging to players who made a false accusation are removed, then players tally the numbers on their tokens, scoring bonus points if they have a token on each piece of evidence, or if they made a correct suspicion or accusation. The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;With three or five players, you decrease (increase) the number of evidence cards handed out at the start of the game and the number of tokens that can be placed on a clue.&#10;&#10;",

In Posthuman, you journeyed to the last bastion of organized human society in the area: The Fortress. A year down the line, you have become an active part of that society and honed the skills you need to fulfill your role there, but the mutants are gaining ground...&#10;&#10;Posthuman Saga is a standalone survival game in the Posthuman universe. You play a seasoned member of the Fortress' militia, sent out beyond the defensive perimeter to explore and hopefully reconnect with outposts the Fortress has lost touch with, while searching for scavengable sites along the way. You have to forge across a crumbled land where resources are spare and mutants roam the ruined mansions and forests alike.&#10;&#10;Like the initial Posthuman, this is a sandbox-style survival journey, but the game system in Posthuman Saga differs from that of the first game in the series. Players win by  completing various objectives that suit different characters and playing styles. It has an emphasis on tactical choices on two levels: the journey expressed through an innovative modular tile map puzzle and the individual  story and combat encounters. The latter are fast, card-based affairs involving tough choices with future consequences. Posthuman Saga boasts over one hundred, finely crafted story scenes with a simple, push-your-luck mechanism that supplements the emergent narrative afforded by the game. Mutation is a way of life in the Posthuman world, and it can have its advantages, but it can easily get out of control...&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "City building has never been so easy: Just roll the dice, then build a building. However, each die must be selected carefully to fit the building requirements. Push your luck too far &ndash; or select carelessly &ndash; and a player may find himself demolishing his city instead of building it up. Choose each die wisely and build efficiently in order to erect magnificent skyscrapers and create the best skyline!&#10;&#10;Skyline is a quick push-your-luck dice game involving set collection. Unlike other dice games that provide no relationship from turn to turn and no player interaction, this game allows players to literally build upon their decisions each turn and react to their opponents' actions.&#10;&#10;Each turn, players choose to roll dice from either the Construction Yard or the Abandoned District, with the goal of erecting urban buildings. Buildings are made up of three types of dice: Ground Floor dice, Mid-Floor dice and Penthouse dice. Some buildings are safer to build but provide little reward, while other buildings have poor probabilities but can have substantial impact on the success of a player's skyline.&#10;&#10;After rolling their selected dice, the player must use at least one of these dice to take one of three possible actions: Abandon, Build, or Cancel Construction. The Build action is the desired outcome, of course, but can be carried out only if the die result matches what they need to build. For instance, all Ground Floor dice can be built without restriction, but a High-Rise Mid-Floor die result can be built only on top of a High-Rise Ground Floor die. Likewise, a Mid-Rise Penthouse die can be built only on a Mid-Rise Mid-Floor die. If the rolled results do not allow them to Build, then the player must Cancel Construction on one of their existing buildings. If a player does not want to Cancel Construction, then they must Abandon by placing that die in the Abandoned District, which gives their opponents the opportunity to capitalize on this failure.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, points are rewarded for completed buildings according to their height. A Level 3 building &ndash; that is, a building comprised of three dice &ndash; is worth 9 points, while a Level 4 building is worth 16, and so on.&#10;&#10;Remember, the dice control the results...but the players control the dice.&#10;&#10;",

At the beginning of each round, players have to work their way through their sliding puzzle controllers simultaneously, trying to create the sequence of actions they want their car to perform during the round.&#10;&#10;Each symbol on the puzzle corresponds to one of the possible actions &mdash; but only the two middle rows of commands on your controllers will be applied, so there's room for maneuvers, but be quick!

The four heroes are Milo Boggs (the alchemist), Canice Gormleigh (the gun mage), Gardek Stonebrow (a trollkin warrior), and Pog (a gobber mechanic) that controls a light warjack named Doorstop.&#10;&#10;Each character has a starting stat sheet, but players can purchase character ability cards with XP gained from the adventure to enhance and customize their characters.&#10;&#10;Combat is based on rolling dice against opposing attributes. Players will be able to use feats and abilities to give boosts to these dice rolls, similar in many ways to other games based in the Iron Kingdoms.&#10;&#10;",

From the initial D-Day drops, on June 6th, to the fighting in the Norman bocage, and on to Operation Market Garden, this combination of Band of Heroes and its expansion, Swift &amp; Bold, arrives at the battle heavy, with 30 scenarios, over 650 die-cut counters, and the latest v4.1 rules. Command audacious American and British paratroopers and glider troops in daring missions against stalwart defensive positions and fiendish counterattacks by the German Wehrmacht, SS, and Fallschirmj&auml;gers.&#10;&#10;Infantry squads and intrepid individuals, such as skilled Leaders and Heroes, are at the core of the LnL Tactical Series. With them you can fire M1919A4, Vickers, MG34, and MG42 machine guns; take aim at approaching tanks with Bazookas, Piats, and Panzerfausts; and find the range with heavy mortars and numerous anti-tank guns, from the American 57mm to the dreaded German 88mm. Vehicles, especially tanks, also clatter onto the battlefield to take on pesky infantry and, of course, each other. M4A1 Shermans, M5A1 Stuarts, Fireflies, and Cromwells square off against Panzer IIIs and IVs as well as the big cats: Panthers and Tigers.&#10;&#10;Heroes of Normandy has 30 scenarios and tell the battles of the men from the 101st Airborne, 82nd Airborne, British 6th Airborne, 17th SS Panzergrenadier, 6th Fallschirmjager, 91st Airlanding, and 352nd Infantry Divisions.  The scenarios cover battles spanning the D-Day drops, fighting the Norman hedgerows, and Operation Market Garden.&#10;&#10;It&rsquo;s squad-level tactical combat at its most exciting!&#10;&#10;UPDATE: All of our manuals and guides can be Downloaded, Viewed, and even printed right from our LnLP Online Library: We now have an Online Library of all, well almost all of our manuals.

    "description": "Dungeon of Mandom VIII is a press-your-luck dungeon delve in which 2-4 players take turns essentially daring each other to go into a dungeon with less equipment than they start off with while filling the dungeon with monsters. Players can win the game by winning two rounds or get eliminated from the game by losing two rounds.&#10;&#10;The game is played in rounds. Each round, the player sets up the base character &mdash; one of eight heroes in the box &mdash; and all the equipment this character has. This one character represents every player being a fully-equipped dungeon delver.&#10;&#10;The start player (the person who challenged the dungeon last or the last player to be in a dungeon) can choose to draw a card from the monster deck or pass their turn. If they choose to draw, they can do one of two things: (1) keep it and remove a piece of equipment or (2) place it face down in the dungeon. Placing it face down in the dungeon creates the dungeon deck and fills the dungeon with monsters that the challenger will have to face later. If they choose to pass their turn, they cannot participate in the rest of the round. Once only one person is left after all the other players have passed their turn, that player then becomes the challenger and must go into the dungeon with only the equipment currently on the character.&#10;&#10;The player then flips cards off the dungeon deck and fights the monsters within. Some equipment allows you to null the enemy damage or be able to withstand it by increasing your HP. If the player survives the dungeon with at least 1 HP, they win that round; if not, they lose. The players then reshuffle all the cards to make a new monster deck and use the same or a different hero to start the boasting once again.&#10;&#10;The game ends when someone has won twice or one player is the last person standing.&#10;&#10;Dungeon of Mandom VIII includes the material in the original Dungeon of Mandom as well as seven new heroes, seven new monsters, and forty new pieces of equipment, with those items having previously appeared in Welcome to the Dungeon and Welcome Back to the Dungeon.&#10;&#10;",

The Soviet ground units are mostly armies of approximately 40,000 men each, with a few cavalry and airborne corps of about 10,000 men each.&#10;&#10;Air units represent about 200 combat aircraft early in the war, and gradually more as the war progresses.

Tasked with building this new city, you and other cultural luminaries vie for control by becoming the Warden, and ultimately declared &ldquo;Founder of Skyward&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;In Skyward, the Warden deals cards from the central deck and splits them into piles however they see fit. Each player chooses a pile, providing them with buildings and resources. However, being the Warden is a double edged sword. While you wield the power of the split, everyone else gets to choose first, leaving you with the remaining pile.&#10;&#10;Skyward is played over several rounds. Each round starts with The Split, followed by individual player turns. The goal of the game is to launch a combination of buildings that yield the most Victory Points. The end game is triggered when any player launches their 6th building or the central deck is emptied. Complete the current round as you would normally, then complete one final split.

Each desperado requires a different number of steps to reach freedom, and once free, when you hit that same desperado, he now robs money from the other players.&#10;&#10;Certain dice combinations allow you to draw multiple bonus cards and choose one or two that you like, and if you skunk out and don't do anything else, you take the top card as compensation. The cards let you take special bonus actions like not paying opponents and using symbols in different ways.&#10;&#10;Win by freeing all of your desperadoes before anyone else or by being the last one in the game.&#10;&#10;",

Play the all new Minions themed version of your favorite explosive card game featuring new card types and magical bananas.&#10;&#10;Exploding Minions is a Minions-powered version of Russian Roulette. Players take turns drawing cards until someone draws an Exploding Minion and loses the game. The deck is made up of cards that let you avoid exploding by peeking at cards before you draw, forcing your opponent to draw multiple cards, or shuffling the deck.&#10;&#10;The game gets more and more intense with each card you draw because fewer cards left in the deck means a greater chance of drawing the Exploding Minion.&#10;&#10;The Minions bring a new game-changing card with them that allows players to Clone cards.&#10;&#10;",

The only downside is that no one likes you on account of the creeping around with dead bodies and the lack of sunlight. But who needs friends when you can make them?&#10;&#10;Dead Man's Cabal is a mid-weight strategy game from Daniel Newman, with game development from Jonathan Gilmour (Dead of Winter, Dinosaur Island). In the game, 2-4 players compete to bring the dead back to life so that they can throw a party with actual, you know, guests.&#10;&#10;The gameplay is a clever interplay of a unique action selection mechanism that allows players to choose both a private action followed by a group action, requiring tense decision-making on the timing of the different phases of the game. Collect bodies, crystal skulls, and runes, then bring the dead back to life. This might sound simple enough, but triggering the actions in just the right order requires careful planning to make sure you aren't helping your competitors more than yourself.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

For you and your coworkers, it&rsquo;s as good as job as any, and if you time things just right you may even get a nice bonus at the end of the day. And since you have a time machine, you can take multiple cracks at it&hellip; assuming things don&rsquo;t get too chaotic with your past selves running around.&#10;&#10;Loop Inc. is played over the course of three days, with each day actually being the same day, but a different time through it. During the first day, players will get to perform three actions and send out their one time machine. Actions include gathering components, setting up advertising, and more. Then, at the end of the day, players jump into their time machines and return to the beginning to start the day over again. The catch is, when players go back in time to try the day again, their past selves are still running around. This means they&rsquo;ll have to perform all the actions from the previous version of the day, as well as three new ones. They&rsquo;ll also have an additional ship to launch. On the third try, things compound even further...making timing key. At the end of the third day, the player who completed the most profitable trips wins, provided they didn&rsquo;t cause too many tears in the space time continuum.&#10;&#10;",

One player assumes the role of King (or Queen), while the others represent the great Lords and Ladies of the Houses of Westeros. Some are loyalists who want order in the realm, others are conspirators who seek to undermine the throne, and all of them have a secret agenda of their own. Who is truly loyal, and who is simply hungry for power, honor, and coin? It's up to the King to figure it out before it's too late.&#10;&#10;In more detail, the game lasts seven rounds. In each round, players reveal a number of mission cards, each of which has an associated influence type: crowns, ravens, or swords. Each noble plays influence cards face down to one or more missions and places their House Sigil at the mission where they played the most cards. Then each mission is resolved by shuffling the influence cards there and tallying up successes and failures. If a mission succeeds, Order is generated; otherwise Chaos is generated. Nobles earn rewards (coin, honor, power) based on whether the mission with their House Sigil succeeded or failed.&#10;&#10;The King can play decree cards during the game to grant favor to nobles who seem loyal, or cast suspicion on suspected conspirators. Decree cards award Order if the King was correct and Chaos if the King was wrong.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, if Order exceeds Chaos, the King wins and any loyalists who achieved their personal ambitions win. If Chaos has the edge, then any conspirators who achieved their personal ambitions win.&#10;&#10;",

The game focuses on cavalry and archery action, featuring mounted archers of exceptional skill. Devil's Horsemen depicts the four major battles of the era - The Indus, The Kalka, Liegnitz and Ayn Jalut.&#10;&#10;Devil's Horsemen features basic rules for both regular and SimpleGBoH play. The rules bring the system into full flower of mounted archery, with a detailed, augmented set of archery and cavalry mechanics that include various types of Shower Fire (as opposed to plain Volley Fire), Impetuosity and Aggression, Feigned Retreat, Harass and Disperse tactics, and Rally to Standards, with the various armies and units being rated for their ability to use these.&#10;&#10;Devil's Horsemen presens a truly colorful array of armies for you to lead into battle: there are 10 full tumen (divisions) of Mongols, plus Polovtsians, Galicians, Chernigovians, Kievans, Persian Khwarazmians, Poles, Silesians, Bohemians, the great Teutonic Knights, and the first army to ever significantly defeat the Mongols, The Mamluks.&#10;&#10;These mighty armies show up in four great battles of the period (ranging from battles needing 1/2 mapsheet to two full-mapsheets).&#10;&#10;The Indus (Genghis Khan vs. Shah Jalal ad-Din and the Khwarazmian Persians, 1221). One mapsheet in size, this is the battle that gave The Mongols control over all of Central Asia.&#10;     &#10;The Kalka (Prince Subudei vs. the combined Armies of Rus, 1223).

After decades of peace, the seal has weakened and demons are emerging from the rift. The demons seek to battle past the valiant knights and kill enough of the elders to fully break the seal before morning. Imbued with the power of the gods, only these brave knights stand a chance of protecting the elders and stopping an army of monsters from flooding into the world.&#10;&#10;Knight Fall is an asymmetrical team game for one to six players. One team controls the knights, who must protect the elders and withstand the demons until dawn. The other team controls the demons, who seek to break the seal to the underworld before morning. &nbsp;&#10;&#10;During the game, you choose a unique knight or demon, each with a variety of special powers&mdash;such as the Flame Knight&rsquo;s ability to surround his foes in fire, or the Bone Crusher&rsquo;s power to summon skeletal minions. The cards you play from your hand to perform actions can each be used in different ways, and a set of unique location tiles allows you to create the monastery with a different layout every game.&#10;&#10;Knight Fall also features a campaign mode for one to two players. In this mode, you read stories while exploring the map of a haunted valley, drawing your path as you travel. Wander through crumbling churches, a sinister forest, and a dark mountain to stop the demons before the final battle at Thornmar Abbey. You must do whatever you can to keep your Knights alive; the death of each knight means one fewer hero to combat the invading demons in the final battle!&#10;&#10;&ndash;description from designer&#10;&#10;",

The aim is to find out who committed the murder, which weapon they used, and where in the mansion they did it. How do you solve the case? By careful questioning of your fellow players you can deduce which information is concealed in the crime envelope. The trick is to be clever with your questioning... Everyone develops their own system! &#10; This version of the game plays faster than older versions of Clue, with the help of bigger spaces on the board, special Red Cards, and a new layout of the mansion so you can walk between rooms. The bedroom has an ensuite, and you can wander from the kitchen straight into the dining room.&#10;&#10;All new artwork brings this classic murder mystery to life, with a high level of detail.&#10;&#10;It also comes with cool red dice!&#10;&#10;Note: In this version of Clue, when playing with the 2-player/Team rules: before you deal the black Clue cards to the players, you take the top four black CLUE cards from the deck and place them face down in a row at the side of the board. When the other player/team cannot answer your question, you get to secretly look at one of the four cards at the side of the board.&#10;&#10;You also don't use the Red Bonus cards in a 2-player/Team game.&#10;&#10;",

Each player has a character card and a booklet (and sometimes special Tactics, Luck, or Spell cards) for one of about fifty (and growing) medieval-fantasy characters.  Characters can range from barbarian warriors to animated skeletons to elven archers to unicorns &mdash; even two different dragons.  Booklets are traded and, as each player selects a move, a reference grid in the books determine the results (wounds, off-balance maneuvers, and so on).  Combat continues until one fighter or the other expires.&#10;&#10;An interesting feature of the Lost Worlds system is that, under some versions of the rules, characters may improve their abilities as they gain experience.  In theory, you are supposed to keep track of your progress with each character, and if one is utterly killed, it will have to start over without its improved skills.&#10;&#10;Part of the Lost Worlds series of books.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Smolensk: Barbarossa Derailed is the latest release in the Operational Combat Series (OCS), covering the campaign along the Moscow highway in the summer of 1941. These actions set the stage for the Wehrmacht&rsquo;s autumn drive on the Soviet capital, and many historians believe the bitter fighting here ultimately doomed the Axis to failure in Russia.&#10;&#10;The game begins on 8 July with Barbarossa still in high gear. In August, the advance stalls as Hitler diverts most of the panzers from the map to forces around Leningrad and Kiev. Soviet counteroffensives will push Army Group Center close to the breaking point by game&rsquo;s end on 8 September. The asymmetry of the two armies will be familiar to veterans of past OCS campaigns, especially Guderian&rsquo;s Blitzkrieg II. There is the expected qualitative difference in typical Action Ratings, along with stark contrasts in logistical capabilities and replacement rates. There also some unique twists in the situation, including:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Three of the panzer divisions are getting their first taste of combat, so their Action Ratings are reduced.&#10;     The rivalry between Heinz Guderian and Hermann Hoth makes it difficult for these generals to coordinate their panzer armies, and might prevent the ring from closing around Smolensk.&#10;     Soviet tank divisions are shown for the first time. They pack a wallop, but their quality leaves a lot to be desired.&#10;     The Soviet 1st Motorized Division is presented as a somewhat elite multi-unit formation that includes some heavy KV-1s and T-34s.&#10;     The contributions of small militia, tank, and anti-tank units are reflected by the Soviet Alarm Pool.&#10;     Other chrome accounts for &lsquo;tree bark soup&rsquo; (used by cut-off units), planes diverted to terror-bomb Moscow, and special markers for artillery ammo &amp; katyusha effects.&#10;&#10;&#10;Smolensk is a small and fairly simple entry in the series, with special rules kept to a minimum. We think players will enjoy the fact both sides must attack and defend. By the end they will learn three things about this campaign: the Soviets are more than just punching bags, the Germans are challenged to hold their early gains,&#10;and the road to Moscow will be paved in blood.&#10;&#10;Seven scenarios are included:&#10;Intro Scenario: Vitebsk, 1/2 turn, using about 1/4 of the map&#10;Smolensk Campaign, 8 July to 8 September (19 turns)&#10;Late July Start, 22 July to 8 September (15 turns)&#10;1st Counteroffensive, 22 July to 1 August (4 turns)&#10;Early August Start, 8 August to 8 September (10 turns)&#10;2nd Counteroffensive, 8 August to 22 August (5 turns)&#10;3rd Counteroffensive, 26 August to 8 September (5 turns)&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "One of Avalon Hill&#039;s family games that appeals to gamers as well.  Players control different expeditions which they equip to explore the Lost World.  Victory is achieved through finding various species of dinosaurs and collecting specimens.  The game comes with a modular board to ensure that no two games are alike, and lots of dinosaur stand-up pieces.  One of the most entertaining parts of the game occurs when a dinosaur chases an expedition back to base camp!&#10;&#10;&#10;This Avalon Hill game has features beyond most family games that appeals to strategy gamers and increase replayability.  First, the board is modular; the location of all the dinosaur sites and required items is completely random every game.  This sort of feature, unusual before the German games of the 90's, puts Dinosaurs of the Lost World years ahead of its time.&#10;&#10;Second, players may influence and interact with other players both indirectly by moving dinosaurs in their path or directly by either trading items amicably or attacking their expedition mercilessly.&#10;&#10;Third-The sharp limits set out in the rules on weapons and ammunition force the players to pick their battles carefully and makes each dinosaur encounter thrilling and high stakes.  Followed strictly, the rules give the dinosaurs a real possibility of winning a combat and requires strategic planning from players if they hope to avoid being chased right out of the game.&#10;&#10;Fourth- The consequences of losing a dinosaur combat are serious.  During the chase you may lose one or more useful tools and even victory points.  Once you escape from the dinosaur, you are returned to camp and lose your next turn.  Because actions that can be taken in camp are somewhat limited, a lost dinosaur battle completely knocks out one turn and diminishes what can be accomplished in two additional turns.&#10;&#10;Finally- The game has excellent style.  The dinosaur areas are displayed in a unique &ldquo;comic book&rdquo; format, allowing for great enjoyment and immersion from all players regardless of age.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Kingmaker: The Royal Re-Launch depicts the period of English history in the 15th century that became known as the Wars of the Roses. It is based on the premise that the powerful noble families used the Lancastrian and Yorkist royalty as pawns in a greater game for the control of the kingdom. Players manoeuvre Noble pieces representing the leaders of 24 major families in England and Wales, in order to gain control over a Royal piece of their own, while also eliminating rival Royal pieces and weakening their opponents. It is a game of political and military action, and the ability to react to unforeseen events. You win by a combination of military, political, and diplomatic skills.&#10;&#10;There are four games in Kingmaker: The Royal Re-Launch:&#10;&#10;&#10;     The new Kingmaker II for 2 to 5 players, for those who prefer a shorter game with a greater variety of win conditions, including prestige gained through domination of the government, cities, and the church.&#10;     The original Classic Kingmaker for 2 to 6 players, where the only path to victory is through controlling the last crowned Royal piece.&#10;     Extended Classic Kingmaker with extra Crown and Event cards along with additional optional rules for Parliament and battles, in which dice can be used to determine whether Nobles and Royal pieces live or die.&#10;     The Solo Challenge, for solitaire play.&#10;&#10;&#10;As a player, you control a Faction consisting of one or more Nobles. Each Noble piece you play on the board has a corresponding Noble card which you display in your Faction space on the table. You can strengthen your Nobles with Titles, Offices and other cards, such as Bishops, Mercenaries, and Ships.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of your turn, you draw a card from the Event deck, and all players follow its instructions. During your turn, you may move your Noble pieces, fight battles, and conduct sieges. You may also have the opportunity to call Parliament to gain the benefit of additional Titles and Offices, and perhaps the chance to crown a new King. At the end of your turn, you draw from the Crown deck, which may enable you to add a new Noble to your Faction or increase the power of a Noble already in play.&#10;&#10;",

You're a Roman statesman struggling to survive in this era of cultural decline and political chaos. While foreign invaders and domestic incompetents devour the last resources of the Empire, you'll try to build your career out of the rubble. You start in Rome, and the Visigoth starts on the outskirts of a spiral board. Each turn, you play and purchase cards that produce resources and give you special effects, as well as allowing you to move further out from the doomed Eternal City. Then the Visigoth moves toward Rome, destroying your cards... unless you spend your precious resources to bribe him. When the Visigoth reaches Rome, or a player reaches the outskirts of the empire, the game is over and the player who has fled the furthest from Rome wins.&#10;&#10;",

Times have changed greatly since the PRC failed to conquer the island of Taiwan from the nationalists' Republic of China at the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949 and the states that were even then separated by politics and economics have grown further apart as both sides now hurl men, weapons, and material into the maelstrom of modern combat in an attempt to settle their bitter division once and for all.&#10;&#10;Next War: Taiwan, the next volume in GMT's series of Next War games and the follow-on to Next War: Korea, allows players to fight a near future war in and around the island of Taiwan. In this sequel, the communist leadership of the PRC have decided that its time to end its rhetoric and posturing and bring the long-lost democratically governed ROC island into the fold of the Socialist Harmonious Society.&#10;&#10;Due to the nature of the &quot;terrain&quot; surrounding Taiwan, the game features an expanded, yet still abstracted and playable, naval system including submarine threats, ASW, mine warfare, and anti-naval strikes. In addition, rules exist for combining Next War: Taiwan with Next War: Korea to simulate an expanded conflict.&#10;&#10;Note: the Next War series is not an Introductory wargame. Rather, we have intended herein to create a system (and a series) that will allow detailed study of modern warfare in various venues as well as engaging gameplay. That said, the Standard Game rules encompass a fairly straightforward ruleset that will, we think, be considered pretty &quot;easy to learn&quot; by experienced wargamers. So players who choose to play Standard Game scenarios can have a relatively quick game when that's what suits them. The real flavor of a war in the theatre, though, comes through in the Advanced Game, where you get much more control over airpower and can more clearly see each side's strengths and weaknesses. For players who want a &quot;mini-monster game&quot; experience, playing the Advanced Game Campaign Scenarios with some or all of the optional rules will definitely &quot;deliver.&quot;&#10;&#10;Ownership of Next War: Korea will NOT be required to play.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;UnitsGround units in Next War: Taiwan represent primarily brigades, regiments, and battalions of the armies of the PRC and ROC and the United States. All ground units are rated for their attack and defense strengths, movement capabilities, and unit efficiency.&#10;&#10;Air units represent fighter, bomber, and attack squadrons of the major combatants and are rated for All-Weather Capabilities as well as their range, average pilot skill, and their abilities in Air-to-Air Combat, Close Air Support, and Strike missions.&#10;&#10;Naval units and capabilities are abstracted somewhat in the Next War series. A &quot;Sea Control&quot; mechanism reflects the results of the surface and sub-surface battles, while the game's naval unit counters represent the major Aircraft Carrier Battle Groups and Amphibious Ready Groups of the US Navy. Additional amphibious capabilities are represented by the Special Forces capabilities of each side. Changes to the naval system include&#10;&#10;     Naval Display Play Aid to allow for movement, air ranges, etc. in the seas surrounding Taiwan&#10;     a Submarine Threat Level and ASW Level matrix for the PRC and Allies respectively to represent the subsurface conflict&#10;     naval mine warfare allowing either side to attempt to deny usage of Beaches for Amphibious Assaults or Ports and Beachheads for Sea Transport&#10;     anti-Naval Strikes (including Cruise Missiles) allowing each side to force enemy Naval units to withdraw or risk losses&#10;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Maps and TerrainThe game's map presents the island of modern-day Taiwan at a scale of roughly 7.5 miles per hex. The map covers the entire island and includes several holding boxes and tracking displays.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Game SystemA game turn is generally composed of:&#10;&#10;Weather Determination. Bad weather can severely hamper air and naval operations activity and can significantly slow ground operations.&#10;&#10;Initiative Determination and Air/Naval Phase, wherein Air Superiority levels and air availability are determined and Sea Control is established or modified.&#10;&#10;Special Operations Phases in the Advanced Game allowing players to utilize their special operators in various recon and raid missions behind enemy lines.&#10;&#10;Strike Phases in the Advanced Game allowing players to launch air strikes, cruise missiles, and artillery and SSM strikes.&#10;&#10;One or more Movement and Combat Phases that allow both sides to move, react, and fight, with an advantage to the Initiative player on non-Contested turns&#10;&#10;Arrival of Reinforcements and Replacements&#10;Victory Determination&#10;&#10;Combat resolution examines not only unit strengths but also unit efficiency (representing training, doctrine, and morale), as well as the terrain where the combat takes place. The CRT tends to be very bloody in nature, reflecting what we believe will be a degree of attritional warfare early due to the lethality of modern weapons. As in many games, casualties represent not only actual combat losses but also losses of unit cohesion brought about by the rapid pace with which modern armies are able to engage and exploit on the battlefield.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;ScenariosThere are several Standard Game scenarios. The first three are small and cover the first weeks of the war by dividing the island into roughly three equal sections. These focus on the initial assaults by the PRC to establish beachheads and take Ports and introduce players to the basic mechanics of the system, while giving them insight into attack and defense strategies for the &quot;big game.&quot; Players can also play the entire Campaign Game which uses the entire map and all of the Standard Game rules. One other scenario is provided which examines a theoretical U.S. Amphibious landing in an attempt to take back the island.&#10;&#10;The Advanced Game Scenarios come in three flavors &agrave; la NATO: The Next War in Europe: Strategic Surprise, Tactical Surprise, and Extended Buildup. This offers the players the ability to game out a variety of &quot;At Start&quot; war scenarios based on varying levels of readiness.&#10;&#10;There is also an International Posture Matrix &agrave; la Flashpoint: Golan &#226;&#128;&#147; The Fifth Arab-Israeli War to allow players to experiment with a variety of intervention options for the non-Chinese players in the region.&#10;&#10;In addition, there is a full set of rules covering how to play a combined Next War: Taiwan/Korea game.&#10;&#10;In Next War: Taiwan, the Taiwan Straits are on fire with the Goliath of the PRC arrayed against the David of the ROC. Can you, as the People's Liberation Army/Naval commander, conquer the long separated island in four weeks before the full might of the U.S. can be brought to bear? Can you, as the Republic of China's Army commander, hold out against the renewed Communist assault until help arrives? And what will happen in Korea while all this is going on? There&rsquo;s only one way to find out...&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Components&#10;     1 22x34&quot; map&#10;     1 11x17&quot; Naval Display&#10;     3 9/16&quot; counter sheets&#10;     2 rulebooks (Standard + Advanced Rules and Game Specific Rules) &#10;     6 8.5x11&quot; Player Aids &#10;     2 11x17&quot; Player Aids &#10;     1 10-sided die &#10;&#10;&#10;Game Design and Development: Mitchell Land&#10;Original System Design: Gene Billingsley&#10;&#10;TIME SCALE 3.5 days per turn&#10;MAP SCALE 7.5 miles per hex&#10;UNIT SCALE Brigade / Regiment / Battalion&#10;NUMBER OF PLAYERS One or two (can be played in teams)&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Colonizing is hard work! Relax with a rousing round of golf on the Mars back-nine! Can you land your specially-engineered golf ball between the rocky hazards on the wind-swept Martian plateau? Can you drive over treacherous terrain and sink your shot in fewer flicks than your opponents? You'll be surprised how much golf on Mars plays like the classic Earth game, and with dozens of hole arrangements there is no shortage of exciting new challenges. Suit up, grab your clubs, and flick for a crater-hole-in-one!&#10;&#10;Mars Open: Tabletop Golf is a dexterity golf game. On your turn, flick your golf ball card over obstacles and toward the crater hole box. Your goal is to land your ball in the box in as few strokes as possible. After all players have finished the hole, reassemble the obstacles into the next hole and tee off again. The winner is the player with the lowest score after nine (or eighteen) holes.&#10;&#10;",
