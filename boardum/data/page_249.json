After the round of the active player, the person to the left (clockwise)&#10;of the active player becomes the new active player.&#10;&#10;Each round consists of 2 phases:&#10;The phase of the active player: the active player plays a dish card and draws new cards from appropriate decks.&#10;The phase of the remaining players: (it begins at the same time as the phase of the active player) each of the remaining players has the opportunity to prepare the dish played by the active player.&#10;&#10;The game ends at the end of the turn of the active player in which the last card is drawn from the face-down deck. The remaining inactive players may prepare the dish depicted on the card played in this round by the active player, provided that they have the necessary ingredients at their disposal. The game ends after the turn of the active player is over. To calculate the final score, each player sums up the Taste Points from the dish cards (prepared dishes) collected in his or her score pile. Additionally, players receive 1 Taste Point for each full meal consisting of 3 different types of dishes.&#10;&#10;",

Basic and Advanced variants allow 2 to 4 players, with up to 8 in a variant for children.&#10;&#10;Each player has two ships on a square grid board. The number of moves a ship may make is based on the direction the ship is traveling relative to the wind. Moves can consist of advancing forward one square or turning 90 degrees. Wind changes randomly every time a three minute timer expires before a player's turn.&#10;&#10;Each ship begins the game with three magnetic prize disks representing the ship's strength. Ships may fire when their broadside is facing an adjacent or nearby enemy ship. The number of dice rolled depends on each ship's strength (i.e. the number of prize disks). If the attacker's top roll is higher than the defender's top roll, the defender is deprived of a prize disk.&#10;&#10;Prize disks can be recovered by spending repair cards. Each player starts with a fixed number of repair cards and they are never refilled. Optional advanced rules include the drawing of random effects cards on each attack, attacking enemy repair ports, boarding damaged ships, mists that provide sanctuary from attack, and ramming.&#10;&#10;",

They try to survive by exploring the island and collecting provisions, with each team doing their best to outsmart their rivals. The teams face off in exciting elimination challenges. After the tribes have merged it&rsquo;s every player for himself. Players individually vote for those tribe members with whom they&rsquo;ll try to keep going as long as possible. Will you survive this bloodcurdling knock-out race? Who among you is the true Survivor?&#10;&#10;Goal of the game:&#10;The player who, after the Merge, has cast the most votes for the last standing tribe member wins Expeditie Robinson.&#10;&#10;Game-play:&#10;Expeditie Robinson is played in 2 phases:&#10;1. The Team Phase (2 islands)&#10;2. The Merge (1 island, every man for himself)&#10;&#10;The Team Phase (2 islands)&#10;Each team tries to accomplish 3 different missions before the Team Phase ends.&#10;&#10;With each of the three missions the teams can earn an extra voting card to be used in the next phase.&#10;&#10;The 3 missions&#10;&deg; Have more tribe members (pawns) than the opposing team.&#10;&deg; Have &ldquo;explored&rdquo; (turned over) more island tiles than the opposing team. &#10;&deg; Have more provisions left than the opposing team.&#10;&#10;The teams take turns. A turn consists of two action points. There are two different actions, each costing one action point.&#10;&#10;&deg; Choosing an island tile&#10;Choose one tile from the four stacks in the middle of the table and join it to the island.&#10;&#10;&deg; Moving a tribe member&#10;Move a team member by one tile. It doesn't matter if the tile has been explored already. by doing this you can explore the tiles you've added and find provisions. With these provisions you can feed your tribe members and build tools.&#10;&#10;During a turn a team can perform every possible combination of these two actions. As well as actions, you are always allowed to make a campfire and tools without the cost of action points.&#10;&#10;Elimination challenge&#10;Whenever the 'Elimination challenge' tile has been revealed the challenge is played. The teams each take their own sets of dice and take turns. They must try to build a tower of six dice, with &ldquo;6&rdquo; at the bottom, followed by &ldquo;5&rdquo;, then &ldquo;4&rdquo;, then &ldquo;3&rdquo;, then &ldquo;2&rdquo;, and finally &ldquo;1&rdquo; on top. The first player to succeed wins.&#10;&#10;The Merge (1 island, every man for himself)&#10;Players now play on individually; teams no longer exist. Each player receive voting cards for 4 votes, 2 votes. Players that belonging to the team that won a mission during the Team Phase gets 1 extra vote for every mission they won.&#10; Voting&#10;Players cast their votes in secret. Putting every voting card they possess into a slot in the voting tray. &#10;On the voting tray each slot has its own color. These colors represent tribe members. Casting a vote into the red slot means voting for the red tribe member. Of course you will do what you can for your chosen tribe member to be the last one standing.&#10;&#10;The knock-out race begins&#10;Just as in the Team Phase, a player playing his turn has the two same action points and actions that can be used.&#10;&#10;The players try to find food for the tribe member they voted for so they stay in the game. But not to obvious, otherwise they might get discovered and thrown out by other players.&#10;&#10;One by one the tribe members will get eliminated. The game will continue this way until there&rsquo;s only one tribe member left. This is the last standing tribe member, in other words, the true Survivor.&#10;&#10;Now the time has come for an exciting moment &minus; who voted for this tribe member and how many votes did he cast? The player to have cast the most votes for the Survivor, is the winner!&#10;&#10;",

The Captain's Game ignore the ships powers on the cards.&#10;&#10;Each player receives 5 ship tiles, one of each ship: Battleship, Destroyer, Aircraft Carrier, Submarine, Patrol Boat. Each player places them in front of them in any order to make up their fleet.&#10;&#10;On a player's turn they choose one of the ships in their Fleet to attack with and move it to the front of their line. Next the player chooses a ship of an opposing player to attack. The attacking player can only choose one of the first 2 ships in the line to attack. The attacking ship tile shows how many dice to roll. Roll that number of dice and check for hits. Each of the 8 dice is the same. 5 of the sides match the colors of the 5 ships, and the sixth side is a &ldquo;burst&rdquo; or &ldquo;wild&rdquo;. IF the player does not sink it, the dice are passed to the next player.&#10;&#10;Set aside any hits and then re-roll based on the attacking ship&rsquo;s powers. Once the number of hits equals or exceeds the defense number on the ship that's defending, it is sunk removed from play and the attacking player gets a point. The first player to an agreed number of set points wins. Here&rsquo;s a breakdown of the individual ship powers:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Battleship: Declare target. Roll all 8 dice a total of 4 times. Bursts do not count as hits.&#10;     Destroyer: Declare target. Roll 6 dice a total of 2 times. Bursts count as 2 hits.&#10;     Aircraft Carrier: Roll 6 dice THEN declare your target, then roll 1 more time. Bursts count as 1 hit. The Aircraft Carrier can also attack from anywhere in your line, so you don&rsquo;t have to move it to the front where it is vulnerable.&#10;     Submarine: Roll 3 dice a total of one time. A single Burst will sink whatever you are attacking. Submarines can attack any ship at any place in a Fleet.&#10;     Patrol Boat: Roll 5 dice a total of 3 times. Bursts count as 1 hit.&#10;&#10;&#10;Part of the Hasbro Express Line.&#10;&#10;",

At the beginning of the game they are placed in the row furthest from the dividing wall.  Players take turns moving one of their pieces one space (orthogonally).  They then get to use their &quot;air catapult&quot; to try to pop out one of their opponent's pieces.  This is done by placing their plunger in one of the vacant spaces on their side of the board and then banging it.  If their opponent has a piece in that corresponding space, it will pop up into the air.  Pieces captured in this way remain out of the game until that player moves his king up to the dividing wall, at which point he can claim a captured knight piece back (but also tips off his opponent that his king is in the front row).  The first player to move two pieces into the front row (next to the dividing wall) wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

Once all the cones are made, players take turns serving cones, collecting the scoop cards from a cone that they can supply.

If a player cannot serve a cone, they must draw another ice cream supply card instead.&#10;&#10;At the end of a round, a player receives a point for each scoop card collected, as well as for excess ice cream supply cards.

Another difference from the classic game, is that the publishers have added a game board for keeping score, adding even more strategy, because players have choices on how to move their pawns.&#10;&#10;The game starts with a round of the Golden Deuce card game - lay down higher tricks than the other players for control of the lead. Be the first player to lay down all the cards in your hand, and you gain points for all the cards left in the other players' hands.&#10;&#10;Moving to the game board, each player strategically moves any of their pawns the number of spaces to match the points earned in the card game round. Players can choose to move all of their pawns around the board at once (and therefore be able to block out opponents) or move one at a time (and capitalize on the amount of spaces moved).&#10;&#10;Once all players have moved, another card game round starts, and the game ends when one player has moved all of their pawns to the finish.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "East Wind Rain: The War in the Pacific 1941-1945&#10;&#10;A true strategic simulation of the Pacific War, East Wind Rain allows players to command the war economies of the U.S., Japan, Great Britain, China and Australia and build what they think will be the best mix of air, sea and land forces. For 16 quarterly turns, these forces must battle across a unique map that combines area and hex movement to represent the theater  of war from Pearl Harbor to India.&#10;&#10;Naval forces are organized into Task Forces, and are then moved with hidden composition to conduct such naval missions as; shore bombardment,amphibious assaults, carrier strikes and more.  Four different types of aircraft (army air, naval air, bombers, and super bombers) are operated from either Army air bases or Naval Task forces.  Ground units range from airborne brigades to Chinese Armies.&#10;&#10;Despite its scope, East Wind Rain is an easily playable game that will appeal to both the wargamer and naval enthusiast alike. A simple one turn Midway scenario provides an easy to handle intro to the rules and game system. Midway, Solomons, and Marshall campaigns introduce players to the economics and planning of operations.  There is also a campaign game in which players may plan and fight the great campaign that decided the mastery of the Pacific.&#10;&#10;(from the back box)&#10;&#10;",

(Each pad has a number on it, and to jump to a pad, you need dice that sum to that number.) If you fail to do this, you fall straight down to the highest unoccupied pad &ndash; which might take you all the way to the bottom of the game board! The symbols on the dice let you slide a row left or right one space, reroll your other dice, or move an unoccupied level to the top of the game board (effectively pushing players down). If you do jump or use a symbol, you can reroll the remaining dice to try to move again or you can stop where you are.&#10;&#10;If you land on another Doodler, that player falls straight down. If you land on a power tile (which are not recommended for the first game), you acquire a propeller hat, shield, jetpack or jump shoes to use on a later turn; flip over a trampoline or springs, and you jump again immediately.

He is also credited with Bushnell's Law which posits games will be rewarding if they are &quot;easy to learn and difficult to master.&quot;&#10;&#10;How to play, from the publisher's site:&#10;&quot;Pay close attention&hellip; You only have 'til the end of night seven to solve the case.&#10;&#10;To deduce who the killer is, explore the different locations in town to find the right murder weapon, and confirm suspects' whereabouts on the night of the murder.&#10;&#10;Not everyone will give an HONEST answer when asked where they were or who they saw the night of the murder. Compare suspect&rsquo;s answers and look for inconsistencies to figure out who is telling the truth and who is lying. Be careful -- liars will always lie, but not all liars are the killer! Nothing they say can be trusted!&#10;&#10;On every turn you can choose to either:&#10;&#10;Examine a location for evidence.&#10;Choose to question a townsperson about where they were and who they saw on the night of the murder.&#10;Accuse a suspect.&#10;To win the game, identify and accuse the correct suspect before the end of night seven. The killer is caught. You save the town.&#10;&#10;Lose the game by making two incorrect accusations or making an incorrect accusation at the end of night seven. The killer skips town.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Each item comes in different colors, and to pick them up, you must hustle through a path of dungeon tiles of matching color; once you step on a new color (or a corner space), you pick up the tiles that you had stepped on. If, for example, you start on a red key and move on a path that consists of a red sword, another red key, a red shield, and finally a white sword, you stop on the white sword, then pick up all of the red items, including the one where you started movement. You use these items to fight monsters, fulfill quests, and purchase other items.&#10;&#10;Dungeon Hustle includes a few semi-cooperative elements. A character can help give a power to another character, for example, and is then rewarded for doing so. More importantly, you must all work together to stop monsters from escaping the dungeon. After a certain number of monsters escapes, the game ends, and whoever has the most victory points at that time wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Using nine 12-sided dice, Krakatoa is one of the most unusual dice games ever released. The dice are divided into three sets of three, which are colored white, grey, and black to represent steam, ash, and lava. In addition, each die face contains not a number, but a colored dot of yellow, red, or blue.&#10;&#10;The game lasts six rounds, with each player taking five successive rolls of the dice and scoring after each roll. After the first roll of each round, the player must pick up a specific set of dice, such as steam, and roll them again, striking at least one of the dice still on the table. Skill in precise dice rolling can result in a high score. Players receive points for different combinations, such as a set showing all yellow sides for ten points. Strategy comes into play as certain target scores and scoring combinations can result in large bonuses.&#10;&#10;",

Careful not to get the jitters and try to avoid llenya (when your tower falls down). The festival winner is the colla who gets the most applause!&#10;&#10;This is a card game which takes 20 minutes to play where you build human towers through hand management. Turns are played clockwise, with each player being able to either take a group of castellers from the table, take two cards from the deck, or raise part of their human tower.&#10;&#10;To win the game, you must have the most points (or applause). The points are won throughout the game, the player who raises one of the towers first gets 4 points, if that tower is built by another player, they will only receive 3 points, the next 2 points, and the last player 1 point.&#10;&#10;Once a player has risen 3 towers, the game ends and the points are counted.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Marauders is an adventure-strategy game in which players explore a treasure filled island and try to outwit each other in a race to unlock a series of 6 clues that reveal the location of a hidden ancient artifact. The game is unique in that there is no &quot;point system&quot;. The game is simply won by the first player to find and recover the artifact.&#10;&#10;Players take turns rolling the dice, moving &quot;Scouts&quot; throughout the island, collecting jewels and other resources, and unlocking and trading clues.&#10;&#10;The game's signature feature is its suspense inducing mechanism for trading clues: before any trade takes place, the two players involved must secretly decide whether to honor or dishonor the trade. Dishonoring a trade gives a player the chance to steal the clue from the other player without giving up his or her own clue, but is risky and can have serious consequences. Throughout the game, players balance the risks of earning clues on their own (which takes time), trading clues with other players (which means giving up hard earned secrets), or dishonoring trades and stealing the clues (and making enemies).&#10;&#10;The game ends in a flurry of last minute deals and trades as Players try to outwit each other and unlock that one last clue...&#10;&#10;HISTORY&#10;&#10;Marauders was released in 2012 by Tolman Games. The 1st Edition is a prototype ready version and has a limited print run of 1,000 copies. Tolman Games released this 1st Edition through a Kickstarter campaign in September. The 2nd Edition will be updated based on feedback from Players of the 1st Edition, and is scheduled to be released as a larger print run in 2013.&#10;&#10;Marauders can be played by 2 players, but 3 to 4 players are recommended.&#10;&#10;",

Quick Game Rules is basically rock-paper-scissors with cards (water beats fire, fire beats snow, snow beats water).  Each card has a numeric value from 1 to 12, which is used to resolve winners when the symbol is the same.  The player who wins the most battles, wins the game.&#10;&#10;Under the Standard Game Rules, each player starts with a deck of 20 or more cards.  The decks are shuffled and players maintain 5 cards in their hand.  Combat can now be affected by special powers on some of the cards (for instance, &quot;fire cards become snow for this round&quot;).  The winner is the first player to collect either a set of the three cards with the same symbol and with different number colors or a set of three cards with different symbols and different number colors.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "In Blackrock City, you are the chief of your group of outlaws, and you want to claim as much gold and silver as possible by attacking cities and stagecoaches. You will have to be clever to estimate the number of outlaws needed to attack &ndash; and watch out for the Sheriff and your opponents!&#10;&#10;The game is played in rounds. Each round, players bid on the right to perform the next bank robbery by placing a number of outlaws in the center of the playing area; each player starts with eight outlaws. Alternatively a player can skip the round or postpone an attack until after other players bid, but doing so will cause one or more of his outlaws to become wounded. When a player bids outlaws, the sheriff token moves a number of city tiles equal to the number of outlaws bid (in most cases). If a sheriff lands on a player's Chief of the Outlaws token &ndash; as these tokens are located on city tiles and not used for bidding &ndash; one of that player's outlaws is wounded.&#10;&#10;The winner of the bid attacks a city, most likely netting him gold and possibly giving him new outlaws (as they are freed from that city's prison), but which city is attacked is determined by the difference between the winning bid and the lowest bid. Thus, bids from the other players will influence the winner's gains &ndash; and if the winner lands on the city tile where the sheriff is located, he gets nothing. The player with the second highest bid attacks the stagecoach and gains one silver.&#10;&#10;If a player claims something from a city tile, it's flipped over and now has a different power for the remainder of the game, allowing a player who lands on the tile to steal gold or silver cubes from an opponent or wounding one of that player's outlaws. After each round, players collect the outlaws they used to bid and &quot;wound&quot; the healthy outlaws by flipping them over to their wounded side. A wounded outlaw who is wounded again is removed from the game. (Prisoners come into the game wounded, so they can be used only once.)&#10;&#10;The game ends when no player has any outlaws remaining or all players refuse to bid in a given round. The player who has collected the most gold and silver wins!&#10;&#10;",
