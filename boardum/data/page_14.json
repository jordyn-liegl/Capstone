    "description": "In Habitats, each player builds a big wildlife park without cages or fences. The animals in your park need their natural habitats: grassland, bush, rocks or lakes. The zebra needs a big area of grass and some water adjacent, for example, while a bat needs rocks and bush and water, a hart needs bush and grass, and a crocodile needs mainly water. There is a snake, baboon, bee, elephant, otter, lizard, turtle, eagle, meerkat, scorpio, hog, catfish, rhino, etc., each with its own landscape requirements &mdash; 68 different animals in total.&#10;&#10;Each player starts their individual park with an entrance tile, and they are each represented in the marketplace of animal tiles by a ceramic figure (or a wooden ranger meeple in some editions). On a turn, a player takes the tile to their left, right or front; moves their figure to the space just vacated; then draws a tile to place where their figure started the turn.&#10;&#10;When adding an animal tile in your park, you add its main landscape &mdash; the base space for the animal &mdash; to your park, too. While placing this new animal, its own piece of landscape can help to fulfill the requirements of your other animals' requirements, e.g., the water on a hippo tile fulfilling the adjacent otter's need for water. Thus, fulfilling every animal's desire for land becomes a more and more difficult task with each tile you add.&#10;&#10;Aside from expanding your park with different landscape types, flora and animals, you can improve its profitability by building extra entrance roads, trek spots, and watchtowers.&#10;&#10;Habitats lasts three seasons, with each season giving each player 6-9 new tiles for their parks. Whoever has best met the goal of the season receives bonus points, with a smaller number of points for second and third place. At the end of the game, each player scores for each tile in their park based on whether that tile's requirements are satisfied. Whoever scores the most points wins!&#10;&#10;NOTE: BoardGameTables edition contains both XL Expansion and Double Expansion and is entirely replacing the previous editions.&#10;&#10;",

Each player then looks in their personal casebook to find information available only to their character. Players randomly decide who shares information first and in which direction, e.g., player A might whisper information to player B while player C talks to player D. Next, B will share both their information and A's information to C while D talks to A.&#10;&#10;After two more rounds of the most inefficient crime-solving system ever created, players read the conclusion of the case, which might offer additional information or another visual, then they each individually answer three questions about the case, with the group scoring one point for each correct answer for a final score ranging from 0 to 12.&#10;&#10;",

This re-themed version of Battle Line features 60 beautiful new cards by illustrator Roland MacDonald, as well as 10 full-color tactics &quot;wildcards&quot; that give players extra flexibility and choices and help make each new battle wildly different from the last.&#10;&#10;Battle Line takes about 30 minutes to play. To win, you must create powerful formations along your side of the line of battle that are superior to those of your enemy. Victory goes to the player who wins 5 of the 9 battle flags (an envelopment) or three adjacent flags (a breakthrough). Based on Reiner Knizia's original design published in Germany as Shotten-Totten, Battle Line enhances and expands that game system to give players even more tactical options and gut-wrenching decisions.&#10;&#10;Battle Line places you in command of your army's strategies. How will you muster your formations? Will you use your powerful KingsGuard to vanquish your enemy, or perhaps send the King of England or France to the front to win a critical flag? Or perhaps you&quot;ll rely on your spies to determine the enemy&quot;s strengths and weaknesses before committing your best forces. You'll always have plenty of choices. With every card play, you'll determine the strength and direction of your attack while plotting to fend off your enemy's advances.&#10;&#10;In Battle Line, you and your opponent lead the combined arms of the greatest units of the era. Will you, like the great Kings of yore, reign supreme? Play Battle Line, and find out.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher's website&#10;&#10;",

Players spend their XP to unlock new Skills, growing more powerful as the Quest progresses.&#10;&#10;Throughout the game, players encounter different monsters, including Minions, Agents, Roaming Monsters, and Bosses. An unique mechanism of the game is the Guardian. Any of the monster types have a chance of spawning as a Guardian, meaning it will use a random piece of equipment in the fight against Heroes.

The remaining crewmen desperately try to save their lives by escaping from the derelict spaceship, but in the darkness the aliens are lurking...hungry for human flesh.&#10;&#10;The game is played on a hexagon-based map that represents the spaceship.

To do so, the player must write on their map sheet the coordinates of the sector to which they are moving. Every time the players move to the gray (dangerous) sectors they have to draw a card; these cards make the players tell the others their position or lie about it, depending on the card. Every card is kept secret from other players.&#10;&#10;The humans' objective is to save themselves using the escape hatches, while the aliens' objective is to hunt down the humans. Each player's identity and position is kept secret; you will need to interpret the movements and behaviors of the other players to learn who and where they really are.&#10;&#10;",

At the end of the game, the player who has the majority of followers of a faction wins that faction's vote, and whoever wins the vote of at least three factions wins the game!&#10;&#10;",

Players are lords and ladies of noble houses seeking new lands and opportunities for fame and fortune.&#10;&#10;One game of Honshu lasts twelve rounds, and each round is divided into two phases. First, map cards are played in a trick, and the player who played the highest valued card gets to pick first from those cards played. Then the players use the map cards picked to expand their personal maps. Each player must expand their personal maps to maximize their scoring possibilities.&#10;&#10;Manipulating your position in the player order is crucial for mastering Honshu.&#10;&#10;",

In order to prosper, you have to manage with natural resources, rare items, vatus (local currency) and tourists. To earn money or prosperity points, you may also draw on the sand*, carry tourists all over Vanuatu islands, or trade cargo with foreign countries.&#10; On each turn, the archipelago expands and you have to program your actions with five tokens. You put one or more of them on the chosen action spaces, and on your turn, you will only be able to play an action if you have the majority on its space. Thus, sometimes have to wait for other players to remove their tokens by playing their actions. If you are not in majority anywhere, you have to remove all of your tokens from an action and give up hope of playing this action. A good strategy lets you block other players; for example, they won't be able to sell fishes if they haven't caught them first &ndash; order matters! Islands and sea resources are rare, so be quick and take them first!&#10;&#10;There is no such thing as a rich Vanuatuan. When you reach ten vatus, they automatically transform into 5 prosperity points and again, you are poor. Life is hard, but you may encounter ten men to help you; on each turn you choose one of them to increase your benefits from an action. As always, being the first player lets you choose before the others.&#10;&#10;In short, Vanuatu is a strategy game of programming and majorities that features development, blocking, and a lot of interaction between players.&#10;&#10;(*) Sand Drawing in Vanuatu belongs to the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity of the UNESCO.&#10;&#10;",

To win a player must guide the evolution of their species to increase their population and the sophistication of their genes.&#10;&#10;Each round consists of various phases. Firstly each organism must move (either by drifting or under its own power) and then feed. Then the environment undergoes a random change which changes the direction of drift and may force some organisms to give up genes. Then the species may buy new genes, and then may reproduce. At this point some organisms will die and finally each species is scored. This is repeated until either a species gets at least 42 points or the environment cards are exhausted.&#10;&#10;The possible genes include genes for enhanced control of movement, more efficient metabolism, more efficient reproduction, attack and defence.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Primordial Soup: Freshly Spiced&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Combat is handled by dice.&#10;Complexity is low, with the focus on theme and building towards a tense, climactic ending.&#10;&#10;Claustrophobia is played through scenarios of which there are several in the rulebook (20). Generally speaking the human characters are attempting to complete a task (e.g. escape the catacombs, close a portal) while the demons are focused on stopping them.

Along the way, you gain shares in other railroads and watch your reputation soar with each successful delivery before making a final push to complete long hauls to the boom towns of the West.&#10;&#10;This design is a new twist on pick-up-and-deliver games.

    "description": "Warhammer Quest is the original game in the Warhammer Quest Series.&#10;&#10;From the Main Rulebook:&#10;&#10;In Warhammer Quest each player takes the role of a warrior, one of four brave adventurers willing to test their courage in the search for wealth and glory. Each hero comes from a different people. The Barbarian has traveled far from the savage north, a land of bitter cold and ferocious warriors. The Wizard hails from the cities of the Empire, the largest and most important of the realms of men. The Dwarf is drawn by the goldlust for which his race is famous. Dwarfs are grim and rather abrupt, but they are good fighters and loyal friends who remember debts of gratitude as readily as debts of coin. The Elf comes from the green woods of Loren where his kin spend their days hunting and making merry, protected from evil by the strange magic of their land. Elves are incredibly quick and agile, and they are also the best archers in the world.&#10;&#10;In the Warhammer Quest game the players enter a dark and forbidding dungeon. Together they must face the horrific dangers that wait for them. They will be attacked by monsters such as Orcs, Goblins, Skaven and Minotaurs. Other perils lurk in the darkness: scurrying venomous things like spiders, deadly pit traps, and decayed tunnels that cave in at the slightest touch. If they complete their quest the players will be rewarded with gold, treasure and artefacts of magical power. The more gold and treasure you can discover the better.., and the player whose warrior amasses the greatest fortune has done best of all!&#10;&#10;Warhammer Quest is probably unlike other games you have played. Rather than each player competing against the others, all the players must co-operate if they are to win. Also, there is no single board. Instead, the different rooms and corridor sections are clipped together to make a dungeon that is different every time you play.

Can you combine the flexible and mobile water guild with the all-consuming fire elementals who even harm their allies and unleash their full potential?&#10;&#10;The guilds&rsquo; elementals are the lifeblood of the game - they are your troops and at the same time the resource necessary to attack. Soon you will find yourself wondering how to use them best. Each turn you are torn, choosing one of three possible actions. Do you want to strengthen your position at the Rift, sacrifice elementals for powerful combo attacks or gather support for your next turn?&#10;&#10;Gain Riftforce by destroying the elements of your opponent and by controlling locations along the Rift.

Included are Americans who are pressed into service at gunpoint.&#10;&#10;The young American nation objects. Eager to defend its sovereign rights and to strengthen its position in North America, the United States declares war on Britain on June 18, 1812. Taking advantage of the British Army being occupied in its struggles against Napoleon, American forces invade Canada in order to drive the British from its last remaining colony on North American soil. Surprised, Britain reels from the attack and now has to face another enemy threat on another front.&#10;&#10;In 1812 - The Invasion of Canada, players take on one of the roles of the major factions that took part in the War of 1812. On the British side these are represented by the British Regulars (Redcoats), Canadian Militia and Native Americans; and the American Regular Army and American Militia comprise the American players. Players for each side will cooperate with each other in order to plan and conduct their campaigns. Each side will attempt to capture Objective Areas on the map. When a truce is called, the side that controls the most enemy Objective Areas wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Primal: the Awakening is a fully cooperative monster hunting miniature boardgame for 1-4 players set in a fantasy world where humans struggle to survive an untamed wilderness. The game is played in a series of multiple sessions throughout an epic campaign where you will take the role of hunters fighting monstrous creatures and unveiling mysteries about their origins.&#10;&#10;In Campaign mode, players will choose their path through the story by completing quests and unlocking special rewards and achievements. Each mission you choose will lead to different developments of the story and to plenty of unique opportunities like crafting options, unique items and rare hunts to be played. The consequences of your actions will impact the story as the campaign progresses towards the epic finale. Players can also play one-shot encounters in the Hunt mode. Specific setup and rules are provided for single combat scenarios at different levels of gear and difficulty. The Hunt mode also offers the opportunity to play special end-game quests using your campaign characters.&#10;&#10;The gameplay is centred on an intense and challenging boss-fight system that combines tactical positioning on the board, hand management and cooperative play. The combat is designed to be fast paced while focusing on card combos and player interaction. Each monster is a unique challenge that hunters will have to face as a group, completing specific objectives and adopting different strategies. Monsters have their own specific deck of cards which represents their specific combat behaviour including attacks targeting specific areas on the board, special abilities, but also weaknesses and vulnerabilities that hunters can take advantage of during combat.&#10;&#10;The game also focuses on a deep character customization. As the campaign progresses, players will unlock a large variety of crafting options as they upgrade and expand the Forge depending on the specific monsters they slay. &#10;As the hunters level up from session to session, players will also have multiple choices to customize their deck of ability cards in order to build better synergies, card combos and group strategies.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Cooperate to move around Hill Valley to get the DeLorean ready, avoid Biff and his gang, help George and Lorraine fall in love, and crank the DeLorean up to 88 MPH &mdash; all just in time for the lightning to strike the Clock Tower, sending you back to the future!&#10;&#10;In the fully co-operative game Back to the Future: Back in Time, each player takes on the role of a major character from the movie: Marty McFly, Doc Brown, Jennifer Parker, or Einstein the dog. The objective of the game is to have the characters move around 1955 Hill Valley, collecting certain items in an effort to fix Doc's famous DeLorean time machine, defeat Biff Tannen and his gang of trouble-making friends, while ensuring that Marty's parents fall in love. Only when that is accomplished can players then accelerate the DeLorean to 88 MPH down Main Street before the clock tower strikes 10:04 pm!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Unfurl the banners of the Great Houses of Westeros! To secure power in the Seven Kingdoms and to ensure the survival of their lines, the Houses of Westeros each follow very different paths. Some forge strategic alliances, some create complex political intrigues, and still others use deceit and betrayal. But there is no more direct or lasting path to power than taking to the field of battle.&#10;&#10;In Battles of Westeros, two players recreate the military conflicts set in George R.R. Martin&rsquo;s A Song of Ice and Fire series, taking part in battles directly from the books... or designing their own. In this epic board game of battlefield tactics, players control either House Stark, the wards of Winterfell who have called their hearty allies to defend their honor and lands, or House Lannister, an aggressive force funded by Casterly Rock&rsquo;s endless supply of gold.&#10;&#10;Battles of Westeros is played over a series of included scenarios, called battles. Each of these has a battle plan that dictates the formation of the map (called the battlefield), starting positions of each House&rsquo;s units, starting resources, special rules, and victory conditions for the game session. A battle is played over several rounds, with each round consisting of alternating player turns. The goals a player needs to accomplish to win a game of Battles of Westeros can vary (some battles require players to earn a certain number of victory points, while other battles require a player to take and hold strategic positions on the battlefield), but this collection of available scenarios, along with the ability to make your own exciting battles with the double-sided map board and over thirty map overlays, gives Battles of Westeros a wealth of replayability!&#10;&#10;Battles of Westeros also offers plenty of strategic complexity, resulting in a satisfying number of compelling choices in every game. For example, each player has a special randomized Leadership Deck, consisting of unique tactics and abilities; this deck will change based on the scenario being played and characters present. Is Jaime Lannister on the battlefield? If you draw the appropriate Leadership Card, he can order nearby troops to aggressively rush their opponents! Is Eddard Stark guiding his forces into battle? Special flanking maneuvers enter your Leadership Deck, to potentially be drawn into your hand.&#10;&#10;Battles of Westeros also features a level of realism that immerses you in the most significant conflicts of the War of the Five Kings. Each plastic figure base, which holds your infantry, archer, cavalry, and kennelmaster units, has a slot for a banner pole &ndash; a small flag-bearing attachment. The plastic banners that attach to each unit bear the crest of that unit&rsquo;s house, and their orientation on the pole indicates at a glance whether that unit has been ordered yet. In addition to the intuitive and useful game effect this provides (differentiating the units you&rsquo;ve activated from those you haven&rsquo;t), the sight of your army&rsquo;s banners spread impressively across the gorgeously designed game board will give you the sense that you are the clever Tywin Lannister, Lord of Casterly Rock... or the stoic Robb Stark, with his direwolf Grey Wind at his side!&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "18Chesapeake is a member of the 18xx series of games. The series is based on 1829, by Francis Tresham. 18Chesapeake is set in the Chesapeake region of the United States and west to Ohio and the West Virginia Coalfields.&#10;&#10;Two to six players represent investors in railroad companies, spending their initial capital to buy wholly owned private companies and minor companies and later shares in public companies.&#10;&#10;The public companies are each controlled by the largest shareholder (its president). Public companies build track and run trains in order to earn revenues. Public company revenues can be paid out as dividends to shareholders or retained to fund further track and rolling stock.&#10;&#10;A feature of 18Chesapeake, as with all the other games in the series, is that the interests of a public company&rsquo;s president and the interests of its shareholders are not identical, so minority shareholders need to be careful in their investments.&#10;&#10;18Chesapeake is a moderate length game. Experienced, brisk players can expect to take about 2-1/2 hours to complete a game. Novices or more deliberate players might add an hour to that time.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Players strive to become the wealthiest of Cleopatra&rsquo;s architects by constructing the most magnificent and valuable parts of her palace.&#10;&#10;Players, however, will be tempted to deal with shady characters and trade in materials of dubious origins in order to help them build faster. While these corrupt practices might allow an architect to stay a step ahead of the rest, they come with a high price &ndash; cursed Corruption Amulets honoring Sobek, the Crocodile-god. When Cleopatra finally strolls into her new palace, at the end of the game, the most corrupt architect (the one with the most amulets) will be seized and offered as a sacrifice to her sacred crocodile! Only then will the wealthiest architect, from among those still alive, be selected and declared the winner of the game.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;The component design in Cleopatra is the most innovative we&rsquo;ve undertaken to date,&rdquo; said Days of Wonder CEO, Eric Hautemont. &ldquo;While it&rsquo;s still a board game, the dozens of 3D pieces &ndash; Column walls, Doorframes, Obelisks, Sphinxes, and Palace Throne &ndash; all create the sense that you&rsquo;re constructing a royal palace.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;&ldquo;The game play really forces players into continually weighing the risks and rewards between taking enough corruption to enhance your position in the game, but not so much that you are forced out of the game at the end,&rdquo; said the game&rsquo;s co-designer, Bruno Cathala. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a classic &lsquo;push your luck&rsquo; dilemma that continually raises the tension level higher and higher until the game reaches its climax.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Description from the publisher.&#10;&#10;",

To decide which unlucky soul will be the victim, players put numbered power cards in front of the creatures, with the lowest one going to the graveyard.

Each player has a set of identical cards, which are shuffled and used as a face-down draw deck. Players start with an opening random draw of cards, and on his turn a player can either:&#10;&#10;&#10;    extend the road by building a new building &#10;    pay 1 to draw a new building card &#10;    pay 1 to discard his hand and draw a fresh hand (with the discard deck being shuffled for a new draw deck once the draw deck is exhausted) &#10;    pay 1 to place a worker on one of the existing building cards &#10;    build one of the common prestige building cards (some of which are placed at the beginning of the game as part of the setup) or &#10;    pass&#10;&#10;&#10;Once everyone has passed, the cards are resolved up to the provost (which can be moved in passing order by paying money).&#10;&#10;Ownership of the non-common buildings is shown by the card color. When a worker is placed on a card, the owner earns either resources or money as a reward instead of victory points. Players may also choose to help build the castle. Starting with the first player to have passed, players can pay resources to obtain castle stones. The stones are worth three different values (2-4 points). Players collect the most valuable ones first. In addition, the player who collects the most building stones each round is rewarded with a gold resource marker.&#10;&#10;From round to round, 1st player privileges rotate to the left, and the provost starts two cards further down the path from the castle.&#10;&#10;The winner of the game is the player who has accumulated the most victory points once the game end has been triggered the turn the castle is finished. Victory points are awarded for castle stones, cards built, and resources and money in hand at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;",

You need elaborate trading skills to keep your operation afloat as long as possible, and as time goes on the dividends you need to pay every turn will only pile higher and higher! But when someone declares bankruptcy, the remaining fraudster who forged the biggest shell corporation wins the game!&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is simple: Don't be the first player to go bankrupt!&#10;&#10;In more detail, on each turn, players must take one new Fund card from the Funding boards along with a corresponding Industry tile and cash as indicated on the card. You need to pay the &quot;promised reward&quot; of each Fund card in a number of rounds.&#10;&#10;After all players have taken their Fund cards, they may choose to initiate an &quot;inside trade&quot; with one other player in order to buy the Industry you want with a price they can't refuse, or sell your own Industry to them with a good price.&#10;&#10;At the end of the round, players rotate their Time Wheel 1 or 2 spaces, and pay the &quot;promised reward&quot; to the bank if any Fund card is due.&#10;&#10;The game continues until at least one player cannot pay the &quot;promised reward&quot; due and goes bankrupt. That player is out of the game, and the remaining player who has the most VP on their Industry wins.&#10;&#10;",

This edition combines both the original game and its two extensions (Na Berlin! and No Surrender!) using deluxe components of &ldquo;Twilight Struggle Deluxe Edition&rdquo; quality. With only 40 Army/Front sized counters for the Tournament game, and 70 for the whole campaign, and with very low stacking, it&rsquo;s a quick-playing yet realistic affair that favours the strategic and offensive-minded player.&#10;&#10;Each turn is alight with intriguing on-board challenges plus the surprise of card hand Events as players vie to win in one of three different ways.&#10;&#10;In a skillfully blended collation of classic hex-based wargaming and modern card-driven simulations, No Retreat: The Russian Front  stays truly story-centric, providing the proper feel of sweeping maneuvers, exploitation and encirclements across the vast steppes and forests of Russia. With a simple-yet-innovative economic model, players will also feel the growing might and sophistication of the Russian&rsquo;s Red Army, and the degradation of the once-invincible German Wehrmacht, over the epic four year sweep of time that this merciless campaign was fought.&#10;&#10;Neither side can afford the disgrace of yielding an inch of ground to their hated foe, so your orders are: &ldquo;No Retreat!&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;     One Standard size mounted map&#10;     Two Counter Sheets&#10;     One deck of 55 Playing Cards&#10;     Rule booklet&#10;     Scenario booklet&#10;     Player Aid Cards&#10;     Two 6-sided dice (1 black and 1 white)&#10;&#10;&#10;TIME SCALE: 2 months per turn&#10;MAP SCALE: 100km / 60 miles per hex&#10;UNIT SCALE: Armies and Fronts&#10;NUMBER OF PLAYERS: 2&#10;&#10;DESIGNER: Carl Paradis&#10;DEVELOPER: Alan Emrich &amp; Carl Paradis&#10;COUNTER ART: Mark Simonitch &amp; Carl Paradis&#10;MAP ART: Mark Simonitch&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Dead Man's Draw is a simple and strategic card game of risk and reward for 2 to 4 players. Players take turns drawing cards and combining their special abilities to plunder the most loot without busting their entire hands.&#10;&#10;The core of your turn in Dead Man&rsquo;s Draw is all in the flip: pulling the top card off the deck and using its special ability. Your turn isn&rsquo;t over until you say it is, though. You can keep pulling cards as long as you like &ndash; until you play a card of a suit already seen, at which point you lose everything. Knowing when to stop and &quot;bank&quot; your cards is the biggest decision you make in Dead Man&rsquo;s Draw, but being too timid lets braver opponents pass you up with bigger, more profitable turns.&#10;&#10;The cards&rsquo; special abilities are key to success in Dead Man&rsquo;s Draw, and they build off of each other. Each suit in DMD has an effect that the player can target when they flip a card of that suit.&#10;&#10;Anchor &ndash; Keep everything you drew before the Anchor even if you bust.&#10;&#10;Cannon &ndash; Destroy one card an opponent has previously banked.&#10;&#10;Chest &ndash; Double your haul by banking as many cards directly from the discard pile as are in the river when you bank the Chest &ndash; but only if you also bank a Key.&#10;&#10;Hook &ndash; Play one of your previously banked cards.&#10;&#10;Key &ndash; Enables the Chest special.&#10;&#10;Kraken &ndash; Oh no! You&rsquo;re forced to draw at least two more cards.&#10;&#10;Map &ndash; Draw three cards from the discard pile and play one.&#10;&#10;Mermaid &ndash; No ability, but worth more points (Mermaids are numbered 4-9 instead of 2-7).&#10;&#10;Oracle &ndash; Look at the next card before deciding if you want to play it.&#10;&#10;Sword &ndash; Steal an opponent&rsquo;s previously banked card and play it.&#10;&#10;Many of these work well together, like using a Hook to re-play a Sword from your hand to steal an opponent&rsquo;s Chest to go with your Key &ndash; racking up huge points by playing abilities well and not solely through the luck of the draw.&#10;&#10;As soon as the deck is depleted, players total up the value of the highest card they&rsquo;ve banked from each suit. High score wins.&#10;&#10;",

The game features 4 square wood boards (2 of each color) and 16 natural river stones for each player, in two colors, with a rope dividing the play area in half.&#10;&#10;Your turn is in two parts. First, a player may move one of their stones up to two spaces in any direction, including diagonally, in what is called a passive (or set up) move. Second, they take a more aggressive move, which must be the same direction and number of spaces as the first move. It is this second move that allows you to push stones across the board - or off the board's edge. Remove all four of your opponent's stones from just one of the four boards to win.&#10;&#10;SHOBU evokes the feeling of GO or CHESS but provides its own unique challenge.

    "description": "Watson &amp; Holmes is a game of deduction set within the magnificent works of Arthur Conan Doyle. Two to seven aspiring detectives step into the shoes of Doctor Watson, working alongside the detective Sherlock Holmes to try to solve a series of so far unpublished cases directly extracted from Doctor John H. Watson's diaries. Those who accept the challenge relive the adventures of the crime-solving duo, visiting each of the locations where the inquiries were made. Following the trail, each clue brings players closer to solving the case.&#10;&#10;The objective of the game is to immerse yourself in the Victorian world depicted in each story. Visit the right places, decipher the clues, and above all find the path that leads you to solve the mystery before anybody else. Victory goes to the player who accurately uses the deductive reasoning so famously and ingeniously implemented by the hero of 221B Baker Street.&#10;&#10;The game consists of a series of separate cases, each of which raises a number of questions that each player tries to solve before anyone else. To do this, once the case and the questions have been read aloud, players proceed to visit the locations where the clues are located. Each location cannot be accessed by more than one player at any one time, so if two or more players want to go to the same place, the player who travels there the fastest (i.e., he who uses the largest number of Carriage Tokens) gets the clue, forcing the others to go to a different location. Once every player has a destination, they proceed to read in secret the clue that was discovered at that location. They can discreetly take any notes they deem appropriate. Once this is done, the cards are returned to their place so that others can read them in later turns.&#10;&#10;This procedure is repeated during each turn until one player believes he has found the solutions to the case; at that time, he must go to 221B Baker Street to check if his answers are correct. If all the answers are correct, the player wins; if they are wrong, he will have lost and retires from the game, and the game continues.&#10;&#10;Each detective will also have the invaluable assistance of a number of Sherlock Holmes' allies, above all, the good Dr Watson and of course of the detective himself.&#10;&#10;",

When the sixth card is placed in a row, the owner of that card claims the other five cards and the sixth card becomes the first card in a new row.&#10;&#10;In addition to a number from 1 to 104, each card has a point value.

When this happens, the player with the fewest points wins!&#10;&#10;6 nimmt! works with 2-10 players, and the dynamics of gameplay change the more players that you have. One variant for the game has you use 34 cards, 44 cards, 54 cards, etc. (instead of all 104 cards) when you have three, four, five, etc. number of players. This change allows you to know which cards are in play, thereby allowing you to track which cards have been played and (theoretically) make better choices as to which card to play when.&#10;&#10;6 nimmt! 25 Jahre includes 28 additional cards to be used in a new variant. The game now lasts only two rounds, and at the start of play each player receives three special cards. Just before you have to place your number card in a row, you can choose to play one of your cards, with these cards opening a fifth row, moving a previously placed card to a different row, inserting one card between two others, allowing up to six cards in a row instead of five, blocking a row, replacing the card you played, and more.&#10;&#10;After all number cards have been played, players tally their scores, keeping any unplayed special cards, then shuffle the number cards and begin a new round. At the end of the second round, whoever has the fewest points wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "In the two-player, co-operative trick-taking game The Fox in the Forest Duet, players team up, helping each other move through the forest. Collect all the gems before the end of three rounds of play, and you win!&#10;&#10;To set up the game, place gem tokens on the designated spaces of the game board and the team tracker token in the center of the movement path. At the start of each round, shuffle the deck of thirty cards &mdash; which contains three suits, each numbered 1-10 &mdash; and deal each player a hand of eleven cards. Reveal one card as the &quot;decree&quot; card to determine the trump suit. For each trick, one player leads a card, and the other must follow suit, if possible. The winner of the trick moves the team tracker toward them a number of spaces equal to the number of fox footprints on the cards played. If the tracker lands on a space next to a gem, the players collect one gem. If the tracker would move off the end of the path, return the tracker to the center of the path, then add a forest token to one end of the path, reducing the number of spaces upon which you can move (with you sliding gems next to this covered space next to the new end of the path).&#10;&#10;The odd-numbered character cards have special abilities when played, allowing the trick winner to move the tracker in the direction of their choice or to ignore the footprints on one of the played cards so that you can land on just the right spot. One character allows players to exchange one card with each other, while another allows a player to change the decree card.&#10;&#10;At the end of a round, you add five gems to designated spaces, add a forest space to shorten the path, then receive a new hand of eleven cards from a freshly shuffled deck. Collect all 22 gem tokens, and you win. Run out of time or head off the end of the path with no forest spaces in reserve, then you can just keep running in defeat or shuffle the cards and start the game anew.&#10;&#10;",

One of those cities, Yengzuh, is now looking for a new ruler &ndash; a new Trade Master.&#10;&#10;The post is only open every ten years and the selection of the said individual is no small task. It&rsquo;s handled by holding a trading competition as it&rsquo;s in everyone&rsquo;s best interest to get the best merchant chosen for the job.&#10;&#10;All the participating merchants are prestigious, but the competition also tests their ability to deal with unexpected situations. After all, the winner will be responsible of keeping the global prices more fair and stable for years to come.&#10;&#10;There are only twelve free trade cities in the world.

    "description": "Princes of the Renaissance is set in Renaissance Italy. Each player takes on the role of one of the minor Condottiere princes, such as the Gonzagas or d'Estes. Then there are the big five major cities: Venice, Milan, Florence, Rome, and Naples. These are not controlled by individual players, but players will gain 'interests' in them as the game progresses. Each city has six tiles, most of which represent a famous character such as Lucrezia Borgia or Lorenzo Medici. Each tile has its own special properties that are linked to the character on the tile. Thus Cesare Borgia will help you to become more treacherous, while a Venetian merchant will increase your income. These tiles are also worth victory points, depending on the status of the city at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;A city's status will change as a result of war. When two cities fight, they will each need a Condottiere to fight for them. Players bid, using influence points, to decide who will represent each city. The outcome of the war will depend on a little luck and the size of each player's army. Each player also gets paid for fighting, no matter what the outcome of the war is. Thus players can turn influence into gold, which in turn can be used to buy more City tiles.&#10;&#10;No game on the Italian Renaissance would be complete without an element of treachery. Players can be openly treacherous by buying Treachery tiles, which will allow them to do nasty things like steal influence, bribe troops, or knock players out of an auction. However, the game allows players to be devious in other ways, that still remain legal. Making sure that a war goes the way you want it to is an important part of the game, and it is not always the player with the best army who ends up fighting. Want a city to lose, well become Condottiere for them and make sure you have a really bad army, or use Treachery tiles to bribe your own troops not to fight. At some point some player will become the Pope, which means he can form a Holy League (i.e. join one side in a battle). Want to make sure the Pope is on the 'right' side, well why not bribe him? What players negotiate over is up to them. The game does not force negotiation and works perfectly well without it, but it remains an avenue for players to explore.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Fief: France 1429 is a game of dynastic ambition in which players assume the roles of nobles in the 15th century kingdom of France. Each player strives to become the most powerful ruling force in the kingdom by gaining control of Fief and Bishopric territories. In turn, they acquire Royal and Ecclesiastical (church) titles which give their families influence to elect the next Pope and King. Players strengthen their positions by negotiating marriage alliances between their families, setting the stage for love, treachery and deception!&#10;&#10;Fief is a classic French-language game and is being re-introduced by Academy Games in English with updated rules, new units, a new and larger consolidated map, and more. This edition also includes additional components, which enhances game play.&#10; The game board represents a portion of the Kingdom of France in the Middle Ages. Villages have square outlines that are connected by roads that allow Lord and Troop movement. The villages are grouped into eight colored background areas that represent individual Fiefs, which are domains given to Lords to preside over. Fiefs have different colored backgrounds and Bishoprics have heavy bordered outlines that include several different Fiefs. Each village also belongs to one of five church Bishoprics; each Bishopric is outlined with a heavy border line and is numbered between 1-5 along the edge of the board inside a Bishop's Mitre.&#10;&#10;Each player controls up to four family members, comprised of male and female nobles. These family members will rise in power by gaining Royal and Ecclesiastic Titles.&#10;&#10;In Fief: France 1429, a player may attempt to gain control of all the villages in a Fief to gain the Royal Title of Baron, Earl or Duke. For each Fief a player controls, he gains 1 VP. These Titled Lords may now take part in the election for the next King. They may even be a candidate to become King, thus bringing 1 VP and more power to the family! Other members of your family may follow the calling of the Church to gain the Ecclesiastical Titles of Bishop and then Cardinal. These titles allow you to Tithe Bishoprics, taking the Church's (i.e. &quot;your&quot;) fair share of income from other Fief Lords! The highest goal your clerical family member can attain is to be elected Pope, bringing 1 VP and special privileges to your family!&#10; You win the game as soon as you have 3 VPs. This is easier said than done and you may need to form alliances with other players through diplomacy and marriage to obtain your goal. When one of your family members marries a noble of another family, the two of you become allied. You now win the game together with 4 VPs and cannot win alone, unless your marriage is annulled by the Pope or your spouse is &quot;mysteriously&quot; murdered or dies of some other foul means!&#10;&#10;In addition to being wary of your fellow players, you may draw event cards that can quickly change your destiny. Bounty Event cards are beneficial to the Player and include &quot;Good Harvest&quot;, &quot;Good Weather&quot; and &quot;Added Taxes&quot; cards. But some cards are Disaster Cards that can randomly effect all players in specific Bishoprics. These include &quot;The Plague&quot;, &quot;Heavy Rain&quot;, &quot;Famine&quot;, and &quot;Peasant Uprisings&quot;!&#10;&#10;Income can be increased by players imposing church tithes on their opponent's villages or taxing their own Fiefs. Players may purchase new Fief titles, improve their village incomes with mills, and fortify their cities.&#10;&#10;Players will also need to protect their land and castles. Men at Arms and Knights can be purchased, as well as Siege Engines. If you feel that other players are not running their Fiefs as well as you can, you may try to invade their territories! But you must risk one of your family members to lead the troops into possible battle, where they might be killed or taken prisoner. If two opposing armies are in the same village square, a Battle may be initiated. The players assess the size and strength of their armies, which determine the number of Battle Dice each may roll. Each &quot;f&quot; rolled is a hit. Men at Arms are defeated with one hit, while Knights require three hits to be removed from the battle.&#10;&#10;The Kickstarter Edition of Fief: France 1429 included the Fief: France 1429 Expansions Pack and offered 3-D buildings and metal coins as 'add ons.' These items are all still available directly from Academy Games.&#10;&#10;This game is the most recent edition of Fief. It re-implements: &#10;&#10;    Fief (first original edition, 1981)&#10;    Fief 2 (second edition with updated rules, 1989)&#10;    Fief (third edition with completely revised rules and material, 2011)&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Akbar is the third ruler of India's Mughal dynasty, having succeeded his father, Humayun. With the guidance of his regent, Bairam Khan, Akbar has expanded and consolidated India's Mughal domains. Using his strong personality and skill as a general, Akbar has enlarged his Empire to include nearly all of the Indian subcontinent north of the Godavari River; his presence is felt across the entire country due to the Mughals' military, political, cultural, and economic dominance.&#10;&#10;To unify the vast Mughal state, Akbar has established a centralized system of administration; conquered rulers are conciliated through marriage and diplomacy. Akbar has preserved peace and Order throughout his empire by passing laws that have won him the support of his non-Muslim subjects. Eschewing tribal bonds and Islamic state-identity, Akbar has striven to unite his lands. The Mughals' Persian-ized culture has afforded Akbar near-divine status.&#10;&#10;Notables and emissaries from all over the country are on their way for Akbar's birthday celebration. As an ambitious landowner, you cannot let this pass; the festivities are a golden opportunity for you to rise in stature and wealth.&#10;&#10;On your land in Agra, you cultivate and harvest cotton and turmeric. You possess a forest from which you produce wood, as well as a small, but very profitable sandstone quarry. By trading and processing your wares, you can obtain more luxurious goods, which you will then use to woo notables as they make their way into the capital. Of course, your rivals have the same plan; you must use your wits to outsmart them as Akbar's birthday draws near...&#10;&#10;(Description from the publisher)&#10;&#10;",

In Ghost Blitz, five wooden items sit on the table waiting to be caught: a white ghost, a green bottle, a cute grey mouse, a blue book, and a comfortable red chair. Each card in the deck shows pictures of two objects, with one or both objects colored the wrong way. With all players playing at the same time, someone reveals a card, then players grab for the &quot;right&quot; object &ndash; but which object is right?&#10;&#10;&#10;    If one object is colored correctly &ndash; say, a green bottle and a red mouse &ndash; then players need to grab that correctly colored object.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    If both objects are colored incorrectly &ndash; say, a green ghost and a red mouse &ndash; then you look for the object and color not represented among the four details shown. In this case you see green, red, ghost and mouse, so players need to grab the blue book.&#10;&#10;&#10;The first player to grab the correct object keeps the card, then reveals the next card from the deck. If a player grabs the wrong object, she must discard one card previously collected.
