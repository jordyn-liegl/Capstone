A while back, Guillaume showed us a prototype of a game in which players had to find English expressions through their literal French translations - averaging about two clues per phrase. This idea, highly innovative in terms of a game, went over very well in tests. We were reminded of the book &quot;Sky my Husband&quot;, which was based on a similar idea (it included literal French translations of English phrases) - and sold over 200,000 copies over the last 10 years. It seemed logical to us, then, to contact the book's author, Jean-Loup Chiflet. He was excited by the concept and helped us out greatly with the content, as well as getting permission from the book's publisher to use the same title.&#10;&#10;In the game, 460 expressions, each with two clues, are read out by a player. The object of the game is to deduce the original English phrase the fastest. As an example, one English phrase is &quot;Tie-break&quot;. The literal French translation &quot;Repos de cravate&quot; (Resting tie) is provided, along with two clues: Tennis and Deciding Game.&#10;&#10;",

Take one card from the top of one deck, and insert it face-down halfway through that deck.&#10;&#10;All players compete at the same time. One player rolls a die that has one of the six animals on each face. The first player to yell out the name of the animal rolled will score &ndash; except if that animal is on one of the face-up cards; in this case, players must yell out one of the animals not visible on the top of the decks, with the first player doing so scoring &ndash; except for the final rule for animal calling, that being that the animal named correctly in the previous round cannot be called out in the current round, even if it would otherwise be correct. If two or more players yell an animal's name correctly at the same time, they all score. (The largest correct animal is the one that players cannot name in the subsequent round.)&#10;&#10;If you score, you either:&#10;&#10;    Take one card from the top of one face-up deck and place it in front of you, or&#10;    Turn all the face-up cards in front of you face down to make them safe.&#10;&#10;&#10;Safe for what, you may ask? If you call out an animal incorrectly, you must discard all face-up cards in front of you; if you have no face-up cards, then you must turn one safe card (if you have any) face up to put it at risk again.&#10;&#10;Once the face-down card in the deck appears, you split this deck to create a third face-up pile, increasing the difficulty of the game. Once all the cards have been claimed, the game ends and the player with the most cards wins.&#10;&#10;",

For example, you could debunk two of the fallacies committed by the argument, discard a card from your opponent, and make your opponent skip their turn. Opponents may have cards which burn your logic or block your actions.&#10;&#10;Once the argument is fully debunked, players receive one point per fallacy they successfully laid, plus 1 point for the player who finished the argument, and then the next argument is placed in the middle (giving the player who finished the previous argument first dibs).&#10;&#10;The game ends when there are no more arguments to debunk, and the sweet song of reason finally echoes peacefully.

Once achieved a player can summon the Dark Overlord to eliminate another player from the game.&#10;With not one but two different ways to eliminate a player, the other way is by collecting all 5 kitten Lord pieces to unleash mayhem upon another sorry victim.&#10;The last man standing wins the game.&#10; Various action cards throughout the deck can heavily influence the outcome of the game too, such as killing another player's kittens, stealing the Kitten Lord pieces or reviving yourself back from the dead.&#10;&#10;",

Can you hamper or even block your opponent's work? Make good use of the &quot;Tractor&quot; and you will be the winner! The Vege Tables playing deck consists of 4 series of cards (coloured red, green, black, yellow) numbered from 1 to 20 and 8 Jokers card (&quot;Tractors&quot;) giving a total of 88 cards.&#10;&#10;Vege Tables is a true card game, like Spades or Hearts: at each turn a player can use all the cards he wants, but at least one must be used, in order to terminate all the cards dealt in the game preparation. The basic strategy is to hold the cards needed by the opponents, avoiding to open the sequences which can help other players&hellip; but opportunities to score points during the game can drive players to very different strategic approaches.&#10;&#10;The game is for 4 players, but on the website you can find (and download for free) the rules for three a and five, the chess-like version for 2 players, the tournament variations and the play in partnership. Vege Tables is a mathematic game with very simple rules but to become a great player is not so easy...&#10;&#10;",

The defending player may choose to defend his castle by playing up to four cards from his hand face down in front of him. Whoever has the most combined attack points wins the battle &ndash; but both the attacking and defending player can use special cards, which cost gold, to turn the tide:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Feint: lets you temporarily remove your opponent's strongest Knight Card.&#10;    Vassal: doubles the combined attack points of your Knight Cards.&#10;    Bishop: steals your opponents strongest Knight Card.&#10;    Catapult: deals 10 damage directly to opponents castle die.&#10;&#10;&#10;If the attacking player doesn't attack he may draw cards from his deck in one of two ways:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Large Draw: if you have less than 7 cards on hand, draw up to 7.&#10;    Precise Drawif you have 7 or less cards on hand: discard 1 card, then draw 2 cards and pick one to take on hand.

The invasion posed a number of problems for the Soviet high command. The German defenses were organized in depth, and consisted of powerful permanent fortifications, a series of trench lines and anti-tank ditches, artillery emplacements, etc. In addition, the terrain was difficult, laced with lakes, rivers, marshes and canals.&#10;&#10;The two attacking Soviet fronts mustered between them some 3,800 tanks and assault guns, 25,000 artillery pieces, 3,00 aircraft and 1.2 million assault troops. Opposing them were 780,000 Germans, with 8,200 cannon, 700 to 800 tanks, and about 775 planes. Bolstering the defense were such elite units as the Hermann Goering and Gross Deutschland Divisions. With the Germans fighting on their own soil, and the Soviets determined to deliver the death blow to the Third Reich, the scene was set for what became the most bitter fighting since Stalingrad.&#10;&#10;LAST BATTLES: EAST PRUSSIA, 1945 -- from PEOPLE'S WAR GAMES via CoSi via 3W.

They can play any card to start the Play Pile.&#10;&#10;On each turn, you must match or beat the top card of the Play Pile. You may play more than one of the same number or face card on your turn.

When the Play Pile is empty, a player can play any card to restart the Play Pile.&#10;&#10;At the end of a turn, if you have fewer than five cards, draw cards from the Draw Pile to have five in your hand. If on your turn you can't play a card, pick up the Play Pile (yes, the entire Play Pile) and add it to your hand, ending your turn.&#10;&#10;Special Rule:&#10;Four cards of the same value played in a row discards the current play pile from the game.&#10;&#10;Game End:&#10;Once the Draw Pile runs out, your objective is to get rid of all of your cards.

Aren&rsquo;t llamas fun?&#10;&#10;If you pick up cards, you must finish the cards in your hand before you can play your face-up cards again. Once you play all your face-up cards, you must attempt to play your face-down cards, without looking at them. If the card you flip fails, you must pick up the Play Pile with that card, ending your turn. You must once again finish the cards in your hand before you can play your face-down cards again.&#10;&#10;The first player to finish all of their cards wins!&#10;&#10;Card Types:&#10;Numbered Llamas -  Numbered Llamas can be played on themselves, lower number llama cards and some special llama cards.&#10;&#10;Baby Llama -   The Baby Llama can be played on any card.  The next player can then play any card.&#10;&#10;Shy Llama -   Shy Llama can be played on any card other than Big Llama.

The next player can then only play other special llama cards other than Shy Llama.&#10;&#10;Magic Llama -   Magic Llama can be played on any card.

Alternatively, the Memory Mode is for 2&ndash;6 players, in which one player is the builder and must recreate the image as the other players guess what is being formed. Each player has only one chance to guess what is being built, and if a player guesses incorrectly, they are out for that round. The faster you guess, the more points you win!&#10;&#10;Whether Pixit is played in teams, in pairs or as a solo activity, each mode is exceedingly addictive and gets tremendously tense as the Pixit cubes twist and turn. With each game taking between 15 and 30 minutes to play, it&rsquo;s the perfect entertainment for a long journey or a cosy afternoon.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "&quot;Boo-ty Call&quot; is a party game of deduction and seduction where lonely mediums interpret cryptic answers from a sexy ghost in a race to score! Imagine if Guess Who and Red Flags had a spooky baby. That would be this game!&#10;&#10;One player will be acting as a Ghost, looking to get a little lively with the living.  They will draw a Ghost Profile card and learn their secret identity before shuffling it with 7 other profile cards and placing them face up on the table in view of all players in a 2 x 4 grid. All the other players will be acting as Mediums looking to be the first to correctly guess the ghost player&rsquo;s identity from among the 8 face up Ghost Profile cards on the table. They will do this by asking the Ghost player questions using S&eacute;ance cards.&#10;&#10;However, the Ghost has a hard time communicating across the veil and will be restricted in how they share their information based on the s&eacute;ance performed. The types of s&eacute;ances may require the ghost to knock their answers, use charades, make faces, or use non-verbal sounds to clue the mortal morsels in to their identity. There are limited chances to perform these rituals and if you take too long, the Ghost thinks you're playing games and the round will end.&#10;&#10;When a Medium thinks they know who the Ghost is they can tap the card on the board.  If they tap correctly, they successfully hooked up and both they and the Ghost score a point.  If they tap the wrong Ghost, they have made an awkward misjudgment and won't be able to guess again this round.&#10;&#10;Then the Medium to the left of the Ghost becomes the next Ghost and play continues in this manner until someone has 5 points and is declared the winner!&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Players take on the roles of various monsters from horror movie lore, and compete for the most prized victims &ndash; when the sun rises, the player with the most total point&rsquo;s worth of victims wins!&#10;&#10;Create a stack of six &quot;victim cards&quot; and compete to kill the top victim card in each of the six rounds by creating a gruesome tale with your murder cards explaining what you intend to do to said victim.  Story cards numbered 1 to 6 that describe just how you intend to pummel them to death and with what, where, your ritual, when you'll stop the pummeling, and why you finally decide they're dead.  But as you weave your tale other players might add on to you story with frustrating &quot;But&quot; cards that nullify part of your plan.  Every time you play a card, you must read the entire story aloud which is really where this game shines, however other than a good laugh, the story you weave is irreverent for the victory, as the player with the most cards (1 thru 6, only one of each number may be in play per player) claims the victim. Different victims have different points, and and the end victim points are added up to see who wins the game.&#10;&#10;Look it's a cheerleader, I'm going to skin her, with a chainsaw, in a creepy motel, while laughing maniacally, until the prophecy is complete, because she knows too much.

Each player draws five tiles and keep their hand secret from the others.  The first player places a numbered tile in the first slot on the tray and starts the timer.  Continuing with the next player in sequence, the players follow the standard UNO rules in playing their tiles (color succeeds color, number succeeds number, draw when unable to play, etc).  They also have to say &quot;Madness&quot; to signify the end of their turn.&#10;&#10;Play stops when a player has played his or her last tile, has played a tile on the last slot, or when the timer expires.  In the first two cases, the player records his score (according to UNO rules, summing up values of the tiles in other players' hands) and the game is reset (tiles reshuffled and redrawn, etc).  For the last case, everybody keeps their hand and the player who has yet to finish his or her turn when the board has sprung draws four more tiles.  Play then continues.  The game ends after a certain accumulated score has been reached or a certain number of rounds have been played.&#10;&#10;",

Beloved and powerful Queen Angie O'Plasty has died and left no heir, leaving the barons competing for supremacy.&#10;&#10;In Bacon Wars, you are a baron(ess) vying for dominance over Baconia in the power vacuum the Queen left.  Can you be the baron that seizes control over the delicious land?&#10;&#10;Each player control bacon orchards and uses bacon strips (yielded in part by those orchards) to play cards. Cards come in several different types and require different bacon costs be paid in order to be played.  Players take turns drawing cards and spending bacon to play them until there is a winner.&#10;&#10;To win, a player must either:&#10;A) be the only player with any orchards left, or &#10;B) have two level 3 orchards at the beginning of his or her turn.&#10;&#10;",

Each player in turn rolls the three dice and then places one of their cannibals anywhere on the column given by the total of the three dice.

If you enclose a line of the opponent's pawns between two of your pawns (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), then the opponent must take back their pawns except for those in column 6.  The enclosure may wrap around the top and bottom of the board, but not the sides.&#10;&#10;The first player to place their final pawn on the board wins.&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Dragonlance Mage Stones &#10;&#10;&#10;",

Players jointly contribute to the construction of the cave.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to finish alive with the most experience points gained during the race.&#10;&#10;Each turn, player's put a small part of the cave on the table, representing either the ceiling or the floor of the cave. By doing so, a long small cave is created on which different dangerous objects or animals (vampiric bat, giant centipedes, laser beams, etc) are shown. During movement the bat-planes fly either along the cave ceiling or along the cave floor until they arrive at a cave and have to encounter its horrors. The dice-fight that follows during an encounter can be won (experience points are gained) or lost, depending on the strength and equipment of the bat-plane. Players can strengthen their bat-planes by upgrading various parts of their plane (shields, short-range attack, plate armor, power, maneuverability and navigation &amp; control), however only at specific locations in the cave. Players can not only invest their money in upgrades, they can also decide to buy long-range missiles or booster fuel. The long-range missiles can be used to shoot rivals, caves and obstructions. Booster fuel is used to outmaneuver other players by playing an extra turn or to move diagonally. Some cave locations also offer the possibility to explore the local environment, and with a bit of luck player's  might find special upgrades there.&#10;&#10;Each game, the layout, the length and the difficulty of the cave is different. It is a tactical game, thrilling to the last turn, based on a few simple rules, in a steampunk sci-fi technological world, where players have to continually cope with limited resources.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Cinelinx is a fast paced card game of connecting movies, actors, genres and more together to form cohesive links between them. With a dynamic play area based on every card played, the game constantly adapts itself to film fans of any level of skill or knowledge. Want to throw a wrench into things? Director's Cut cards can often hinder your friends or change the rules to keep things interesting. Now you finally have an outlet for that wealth of movie trivia building up in your brain!  &#10;Cinelinx is a new take on movie trivia games and is the perfect way to test your movie knowledge and challenge your friends during your next movie or game night!&#10;&#10;&#10;Rules&#10;1) Separate Director&rsquo;s Cut cards from the main deck and set them aside nearby. Then shuffle the main deck and allow each player to draw 10 cards.&#10;2) An anchor card is needed to start the game. We recommend locating a genre card from the main deck and dropping it in the center of the table to begin. The remaining genre cards should stay in the deck to be drawn randomly during gameplay.&#10;3) Decide amongst yourselves who will go first, and then continue playing clockwise.&#10;4) Players should take turns connecting cards in their hands to cards in play. Players can only play ONE card during their turn, unless instructed otherwise by a Director&rsquo;s Cut card.&#10;Tip: Cards can be dropped vertically or horizontally and connected to any open side of a card in play. The reels that are formed as cards connect should not touch unless a valid connection is made.&#10;&#10;5) Connections must be verbally announced to be considered valid. A connection can be defined as the relationship between two cards. See our official rulebook for complete connection details.&#10;Example announcement: &ldquo;Jonah Hill and Leonardo DiCaprio can be connected because they were both in &lsquo;The Wolf of Wall Street&rsquo;. &ldquo;&#10;&#10;6) During their turn, if a player does not have a playable card in their hand they can DRAW a card and play it immediately, if possible. If they still do not have a playable card in their hand they can draw a second time and play the card immediately, if possible. If they still do not have a playable card then their turn is over. &#10;Instead of drawing, if a player cannot play a card in their hand they can choose to SWAP up to three cards in their hand with three random cards from the main deck. Once a player has swapped cards their turn is immediately over. A player can only SWAP once per game. Cards that are discarded should be placed back into the main deck.&#10;7) A connection can be challenged at any time.&#10;8) The first person to shed their full hand wins.&#10;&#10;Director&rsquo;s Cut&#10;During gameplay, when someone plays a Directors card from their hand they are allowed to draw from the Director&rsquo;s Cut deck and should follow the instructions on the card they draw. Most Director&rsquo;s Cut cards can be played immediately. &#10;Challenging a play&#10;If a connection is challenged and is proven VALID then the challenger must either draw a card or lose a turn. The player who was challenged can decide which option the challenger should proceed with.&#10;If a connection is challenged and is proven INVALID then the player who was challenged must take their card back and draw an additional card. Their turn ends immediately after they draw.&#10;&#10;Download the Cinelinx Rulebook&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "AKA 'James Ernest Writes Off Another Trip To VEGAS'.  In this game you move around a Monopoly type board.  There are three types of spaces on the board, Casino, Draw/Showdown and Penalty.  Each player starts with $500, 15 personal counters used for marking sweepstakes and laps and 5 cards dealt from a standard deck of cards.&#10;&#10;On casino spaces you get to play a casino game to try to win more money.  After playing a casino game you can buy sweepstakes tickets in that casino.&#10;&#10;On penalty spaces you pay a penalty to the casino then you may buy sweepstakes tickets.  Sweepstakes tickets are used at the end of the game to try to win each casinos pot.&#10;&#10;You can stop on draw/showdown spaces when you pass them in lieu of moving your whole dice total.  If you chose to draw you draw a card and place it in front of you.  It is considered part of your hand.  If you choose showdown all players show their hands and the player who holds the best poker hand receives the pot generated by sweepstakes ticket sales.  5 new cards are then dealt to each player.&#10;&#10;The game ends on the next showdown after all player has gone 4 (3 with 5 or 6 players) laps around the board.&#10;&#10;",
