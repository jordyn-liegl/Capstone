(Paris is worth a mass) covers two battles of the French Religion Wars, Dreux (1562) and Ivry (1590).&#10;&#10;The game uses a slightly streamlined version of the rules used in Ben Hull's other game, This Accursed Civil War (which covered the English Civil War). These battles are somewhat smaller than in the GMT game, as befitting the smaller format offered by Vae Victis.&#10;&#10;Armies are divided into 3-5 &quot;wings,&quot; each of which is given orders every turn (either &quot;Charge,&quot; &quot;March,&quot; or &quot;Rally&quot;) and it is the giving and carrying-out of orders which drives the game.  Wings are activated one at a time, alternating between players.&#10;&#10;",

The Crusaders, led by Bishop Albert, are crossing the borders from the South. Vsevolod, Prince of Novgorod, is attacking from the East. There's only one hope for Estonians: Lembitu, the leader, who is brave enough to fight against all the conquerors.&#10;&#10;Lembitu is a co-operative board game inspired by the events of the Livonian Crusade in Estonia. Players are in the role of generals, fighting against conquerers and initiating rebellions. Actions can be used for movement, fighting or uprisings &mdash; but as each player has only a limited number of actions, they must plan carefully. The direction and speed of enemy movement is decided by dice, but the enemy's ultimate goal is to reach Paide. If they don't reach it within a fixed amount of turns, the players win.&#10;&#10;",

The battle was fought from October 23-26 1944 as the US returned to the Philippines, landing on the island of Leyte. The US Navy and the Imperial Japanese Navy fought a series of actions that collectively have been recorded as the Battle of Leyte Gulf. The historical result was a decisive defeat of the Imperial Navy, virtually eliminating it as a viable force for the remainder of the war. For the US Navy, it was a victory that was almost squandered due to command problems.&#10;&#10;Each game turn is six hours; there are three day turns and one night turn for each calendar day.

Each player has a number of units in his army, which is set depending on the faction they are playing. We call this combination of units a &ldquo;Combat Sword&quot;. Four factions are available for players:  Union of Terra, Centauri Brotherhood, Heimdall Industries and Ascaryan Infestation.&#10;&#10;Game pieces represent the units of troops and vehicles in each army. Pieces have two sides, &quot;Front&quot; (Illustration and Health marker) and &quot;Back&quot; (Name, Attributes and Skills). Some units grant X &quot;Command Points&quot; at the beginning of each player turn, and all units require a number of &quot;Command Points&quot; to be used that turn (which is known as &ldquo;Activating &rdquo; the unit). When all command points are spent, the opponent&rsquo;s turn begins. Each unit, upon being activated, can move and act in any order. The possible actions are &ldquo;Move&rdquo;, &ldquo;Embark/disembark&rdquo;, &ldquo;Attack&rdquo; and &ldquo;Use active skills&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;A typical game is a Sudden Death match, where the winner is the player that eliminates their opponent&rsquo;s ability to activate units.

Players secretly vote for an action and then carry out those actions: Piracy, Raiding ports, Building new ships, Trading.&#10;&#10;The game is especially suitable for solitaire play, and has optional rules to accommodate a fifth player, if required.&#10;&#10;",

Each player assumes the role of the leaders of this war, one side being Roman and the other side being Carthaginian. Because of the political decisions made by the Senate of each side, the players may not always have the freedom or strategic choice they desire. Nevertheless, both players must attempt to make the best decisions to gain victory.&#10;&#10;Option cards, 38 Roman and 38 Carthaginian, are used by the players to influence the Senate, add reinforcements, cause your enemies units to desert, etc. Most of these cards force you to make a choice between 2 options, which adds an element of command.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Reimplemented as Hannibal: Rome and Carthage&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Defending England during the Battle of Britain.&#10;&#10;Tally-Ho! is a book-based solitaire air war game that puts you into the role of a Sector Controller during the Battle of Britain in the Summer of 1940. You direct Royal Air Force (RAF) fighter squadrons as you struggle to protect England from attack by incoming raids by the Luftwaffe &ndash; and in one mission, by the Italians. There are too many raiders, however, and too few RAF aircraft, yet you have one major advantage &ndash; England&rsquo;s &ldquo;Chain Home&rdquo; radar network.&#10;&#10;Fifteen individual missions are included in this book-based game. Each mission relates to one of the key aerial engagements of the Battle of Britain. Most missions can be completed in less than thirty minutes. This is not a simulation of air-to-air combat between individual fighter planes, nor is it intended to be a realistic depiction of the air war, but rather an entertaining educational tool that allows you to experience the story of the conflict through strategic decision-making set against a backdrop of the real history of the Battle of Britain &ndash; as if you were there.&#10;&#10;Tally-Ho! is designed for experienced and novice war gamers alike. It is quick and easy to play yet deeply challenging. Though dice do play a role, the outcome of each mission rests on your shoulders. Where you deploy your fighters, what orders you give, and what tactics you employ are the critical factors that determine the outcome of each mission. You decide which enemy squadrons to engage and how to prioritize each as you struggle with radio communications and the fog of war.&#10;&#10;Most of the time, you cannot stop the Luftwaffe. Bombs will fall. Airfields will be strafed. Convoys at sea will suffer. Your performance in each mission will affect the setup of subsequent missions by reducing or increasing the number of aircraft available to fly on each side. If you direct your squadrons skillfully, you might prevail and save England.&#10;&#10;The game is available on Amazon at: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BMSP4MXM/&#10;&#10;A boxed set of game assets is available through Blue Panther, which includes an add-on EXPANSION GAME called Operation Seel&ouml;we, is at:&#10;https://www.bluepantherllc.com/products/tallyho&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

You roll 6 dice, and remove any dice you want to use for points. You can stop, keeping the points, or re-roll the remaining dice.  Points can be scored by specific numbers (e.g. 5 or 1) or sets of the same number. If you can use all six dice for points, pick them all up and keep going.&#10;&#10;'Bank' your points and end your turn at any time but beware, some scoring dice must be removed after every roll - if no scoring dice are rolled your turn ends and you score zero points.&#10;&#10;The highest score over 10,000 wins the game.&#10;&#10;In 1996, Charlie and Mary Potter, known as &quot;Mr and Mrs Farkel&quot;, created a copyrighted scoring system and lodged various trade marks. The scoring system is proprietary to Legendary Games, Inc. Charlie started by selling product made on his kitchen table. Over the course of 10 years, it became a commercial hit. In 2007 Patch launched a version of the game spelled as &quot;Farkle&quot; with almost the same logo design, which soon after they changed.&#10;&#10;",

When all ten goods are either stolen (and hidden away) or recovered by the police, the winner is the player who has stolen/recovered the most.&#10;&#10;A fairly straightforward roll and move game, but the pieces and quality of build makes this a better than normal game of this type.

Teams earn points for correctly answering questions. For each point scored the team advances one square on the board. The first team to get round the board once wins.&#10;&#10;Each team randomly draws three category tiles and arranges them on the board according to how knowledgeable they think they are in this particular area. A team will usually put the tile with their &quot;worst&quot; category in the first slot and their &quot;best&quot; category in the third slot. If they answer the question from their first category correctly, they score one point, two for the second, and three for the third. After a round has been completed (i.e. each team has been asked three questions), the category tiles are redrawn.&#10;&#10;Each team also has 3 switches on the board that they can activate once per round. One is labelled with a &quot;Z&quot;, the other two are labelled with a &quot;B&quot;. The &quot;Z&quot; switch allows a team to swap one of their categories with another team. The &quot;B&quot; switch allows a team to challenge the active team. If the active team can't answer their question but the challenging team can, they earn extra points (one if they used the switch after the question was asked, and three if they used it before even knowing the question). If the challenging team answers incorrectly, they lose one point.&#10;&#10;Main differences to the standard Bezzerwizzer game:&#10;&#10;- smaller, travel-friendly box, board and components&#10;- 1200 questions (instead of 5000)&#10;- 12 categories (instead of 20; multiple categories from the standard game were combined into one category)&#10;- each player/team gets three questions per round (instead of 4)&#10;&#10;",

It is a 2 player game that shows how the conflict, which began as a &lsquo;civil war&rsquo; turned into a World conflict with a Great Britain that was greatly isolated. It features a new &lsquo;Action Pulse&rsquo; and &lsquo;Initiative System&rsquo; that keeps every turn of variable length and new. Game design by Gilbert Collins.&#10;&#10;The Colonial player must build a &lsquo;Continental Army&rsquo; to battle with the British in order to prevent any sister colony from being overrun. This is going to take time and he must &lsquo;hold on&rsquo; and try to defeat a major British force, to impress the old enemies of Great Britain.&#10;&#10;The game is played at the Grand Strategic level and each strength point equals 1,000 men or less. Players will assemble forces to seize control of colonies and regions. When French recognition is achieved, during 1778, an entire new dimension is added to the conflict. France, Spain and the Netherlands will bring fleets into the waters of North America and the Caribbean, challenging Britain&rsquo;s mastery of the seas.&#10;&#10;The game utilizes the popular &lsquo;point to point&rsquo; movement system but more carefully modelling the geography of North America. This is done by enhancing the movement of armies along the important water shed basins. Armies are not destroyed in single combat as many past games have shown, but will demonstrate realistic casualty figures with prevalent retreat and disruption results.&#10;&#10;War for America attempts to show the conflict from the British perspective and how a &lsquo;rebellion&rsquo; turned into a World War. Great Britain is alone, without allies, but the Colonies don&rsquo;t have it easy either. Despite their inexperience and individual identities, they must come together to create and maintain a Continental army. This is a &lsquo;large game&rsquo; but also contains a shorter scenario starting in 1778, taking about half the time to play.&#10;&#10;Product Information:&#10;&#10;        Complexity: Medium&#10;        Time Scale: Seasonal turns (6 turns per year)&#10;        Map Scale: Area point-to-point map&#10;        Unit Scale: 1,000 men per strength point, individual capital ships, and leaders&#10;        Players: 2&#10;        Solitaire: Medium/High&#10;        Playing Time: 8 hours (15+ hours for Campaign Game)&#10;&#10;&#10; &#10;Components:&#10;&#10;        2 Map sheets&#10;        2.5 Countersheets of 9/16&quot; and 5/8&quot; unit-counters (432 counters total)&#10;        6 Player Aid Cards&#10;        1 Sequence of Play Card&#10;        2 Army Organization Displays&#10;        1 Setup Card&#10;        51 Action Cards&#10;        1 Rulebook&#10;        1 Playbook&#10;&#10;&#10;-description from publisher's website&#10;&#10;",

If the player knows what the clue is, they throw a chip in a bin on the game board.  Once the time is up, the 10 words have been clued, or the player elects to stop, they begin recalling the words that were clued from memory.  Upon getting the word correct (with one guess at each one only), a chip is taken out of the bin and put down on the guesser's side of the board.  If the clue is missed or if it is forgotten, the chip stays in the bin.  Once the guessing is completed or the time runs out, the other team gets a chance to steal the chips that remain in the bin.  If the remaining chips are not stolen, they go back to the guessing team.  The object is to fill up your side of the board with correctly guessed or stolen chips.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "&quot;Chosin: X Corps Escapes the Trap&quot;, is a two-player, intermediate-complexity simulation of the fighting in eastern North Korea in late 1950 in which the Chinese attacked the United Nation&rsquo;s X Corps as it approached the Yalu River. One of the more famous incidents of the campaign was the US Marine Corps 1st Division fighting its way out of an envelopment at the Chosin Reservoir. Chosin, designed by Joseph Miranda, covers the entire campaign using the same game system as Gauntlet, which appeared in Strategy &amp; Tactics 190. The two games are compatible, and the Strategic Scenario included in this issue provides instructions, as well as extra units, to create a combined Chosin/Gauntlet game of the entire Chinese offensive of 1950. Players can also use the Chosin rules and charts to update Gauntlet.&#10;&#10;Each game turn equals one day. Each hex represents 2.5 miles (four kilometers). Units of maneuver are mostly UN regiments and brigades of 1,500 to 5,000 men, while each Communist divisional counter represents about 6,000 to 24,000 men. Each air UN unit represents 30 to 50 sorties. There are 280 NATO-style, small-size (half-inch) counters, including errata-fix replacements for Gauntlet.&#10;&#10;Special rules cover: naval gunfire support, aerial combat operations, air transport, aerial supply, naval supply and troop transport, limited intelligence, bridge destruction and repair, fog of war, meeting engagements, organizational integrity, entrenchments, partisans, special forces, combat engineers, and the possibility of atomic warfare. The short scenario will take two experienced players about four to six hours to complete.&#10;&#10;Chosin: X Corps Escapes the Trap was published in Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #257  Jul/Aug 2009.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 1 day&#10;Hex: 2.5 mile / 4 kilometers&#10;Units: Battalion to Brigade&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 22 x 34&quot; full color mapsheet&#10;One dual-side printed countersheet (280 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 32-page Chosin rules booklet&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: High&#10;Complexity Level: Medium-Low&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 4-8 hours&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "&quot;Drive on Damascus&quot; recreates the one major campaign between the Allies and Vichy France during World War II. It is an operational wargame recreating on the battalion level the Allied invasion of Syria and Lebanon in June 1941. This game has been built around two basic situations: the historical invasion and a hypothetical one, covering the chance of German intervention. In both cases it remains a two player wargame with each player alternately moving his pieces and resolving combat in succession. Whilst the game reproduces the situation that faced the historical commanders, the outcome will depend upon the decisions taken by players; it is perfectly possible to change the course of history.&#10;&#10;Drive on Damascus uses a peculiar hexagon grid game map in which only the central dot of each hex is depicted.&#10;British forces try to preempt an attack from the Vichy French staged in Syria in 1941.&#10;&#10;This wargame can be run as part of a campaign with O'Connor's Offensive, Hellfire Pass and Bloody Keren (which is where the campaign rules are to be found).&#10;&#10;Published 1981, in The Wargamer Magazine issue #15&#10;&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;     Syria, 1941&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 1 day&#10;Hex: 3.2 miles / 5.15 kilometers&#10;Units: Company to Battalion&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 23 x 32&quot; full color mapsheet&#10;One single-side printed countersheet (260 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 12-page Drive on Damascus rulebook (in magazine)&#10;Player will have to provide one 6-sided dice&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: Medium&#10;Complexity Level: Medium&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 4-15 hours&#10;&#10;",

Beautiful, glowing swarms of fireflies may be released only from the highest towering platforms in the city during the upcoming summer solstice. Six different guilds reside in the city, and they will do everything possible to build their own tree as high as possible in each district. As chief of your district, each round you decide which guild you want to support in your part of the city as you want to lure the spectators to your show on festival day and to send as many brightly-glowing fireflies to freedom as possible.&#10;&#10;In game terms, the guilds are represented by a deck of 108 cards, with each of the six guilds appearing 18 times. To set up, deal three cards face up to each player, grouping those cards in columns by color. Lay out five cards face up to form the market. Place the game-ending firefly festival card twenty cards up from the bottom of the deck.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player takes all the cards of one color from the market or one card of each color that appears only once in the market; they then add these cards to their collection. If you already have cards of that color, you place the new cards upward in a column so that everyone can see how many cards you have; if you don't have this color, place cards of the new color to the left or right of your current columns. Then refill the market. When the firefly festival card is revealed, end the game after each player has taken the same number of cards.&#10;&#10;To score, look at each column of cards in your collection and compare the number of cards in it to the number of cards in the columns to the left and right. (For the columns on the outer edge of your collection, you compare their height to the height of your neighbor's closest column and the adjoining column in your collection.) For each column, if it's at least as tall as each column adjacent to it, you score points equal to the number of cards in that column. Whoever scores the most points wins!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Each player, in turn, has the option to make as many bets as one wants but each bet is made &ldquo;across the board.&rdquo; All bets are made in 150-skin (the game&rsquo;s monetary unit) increments: 50 to win, 50 to place and 50 to show. After everyone has placed their bets, the money is divided as equally as possible into seven stacks.&#10;&#10;After all bets have been placed, the race is run. A horse has completed a circuit of the track when five Xs have been placed next to it. Sometimes horses begin with some Xs and sometimes the favorites, horses 6, 7 and 8, need an extra X.&#10;When a player rolls the dice, that player may give the horse rolled an X and pass on the dice or give that horse a / (half-X) and roll again to that horse an X. When three horses have finished the race, the owner(s) of the winning horse and winning bettors are paid. The player with the most money at the end of the game is the winner.&#10;&#10;Across the Board features a pari-mutual betting system to mimic a real racetrack. There are no fixed odds.

    "description": "The story of the Picrocholine Wars is one of the most well-known passages of the novel Gargantua, written by Fran&ccedil;ois Rabelais in 1534. Using a brawl between shepherds and millers as a pretext, Picrochole, King of Lerne, declared war on Gargantua's father, Grandgousier. A model of the enlightened monarch of the Renaissance, Grandgousier attempted to avert war by all means. But Picrochole, taking this as a sign of Grandgousier's weakness, invaded his neighbor's kingdom. Grandgousier calls upon his son, and Gargantua, at the head of an army of his loyal companions, inflicts a humiliating defeat on Picrochole, who flees on the back of a donkey.&#10;&#10;The Picrocholine Wars simulates this celebrated episode of French literature through a fun and simple wargame. Players will find and discover in this game all of the events that gave the novel parodying the chivalric tomes of the era its charms: the giant Gargantua, of course, and his friends Gymnast and Fr&egrave;re Jean, but also the cheating Picrochole and his lieutenants.&#10;&#10;Though it has its &quot;rabelaisien&quot; side, The Picrocholine Wars is a balanced game in which each camp has its own distinct strengths and during which players will have to adopt the role of both the attacker and the defender. The Picrocholine Wars combines gaming pleasure with culture and history, and is ideal for initiating new players into wargaming.&#10;&#10;",

The wooden hunters have colored hats to denote their hunting clubs. There is also a wooden hare and a wooden bush.&#10;&#10;The hare is placed in the center of the hexagonally shaped board, and the hunters around the edges. &#10;The board is eleven spaces across, from one point of the hexagon to its opposite, so none of the hunters&#10;start very close to the hare. Each player draws a club card, denoting which color hunters are his own. This&#10;is kept secret from the other players. The first player then rolls the dice and the game begins.&#10;&#10;The 6-side dice are labeled Blank, 1, 2, 2, 3, and 4. If a 2,3 are rolled, for example, the player whose turn it is decides whether that means he moves two hunters up to three spaces each, or three hunters up to two spaces each. For one movement point, a hunter can either move one space directly forward (they all have little rifles which should point to one space at all times - that's the only direction they can shoot or move) or it can rotate 60 degrees. A player can move a hunter of any color he chooses - no one knows which hunters are whose, and since the object is to shoot all the opponents' hunters and not your own, you don't necessarily want to move your own, anyway. Except maybe to throw the others off track about which color is yours ...&#10;&#10;When all movement is done, check to see if any hunter is aiming at the hare. If so, roll the dice again, this time adding the numbers together to see how far a shot goes. If you get blank, blank, a gun blows up (remove a hunter). If you shoot far enough to hit the hare exactly, it blithely moves out of the way instead of being hit. If you roll the exact distance between two hunters, they shoot each other (if both aiming at the hare -- otherwise, only the one not aiming at the hare is shot) - remove the hunters. If you roll a number greater than the distance between two hunters, one of them dies - take your pick.&#10;&#10;",

They place two balls on each figure. They now take turns and choose one of the following three actions.&#10;&#10;1.Move: Players can move the chosen piece as many squares sideways, forwards or backwards as the piece has balls, if it has 4 balls it must move 4 squares. The pieces may neither jump nor change direction.&#10;&#10;2.Sharing: Players may take all the balls from a selected piece and place one each on any of their other pieces. Exception, if a tower has six balls only five balls may be placed on the other five pieces and so one ball is lost and is removed from the game.&#10;&#10;3.Capturing: Only balls are captured, not pieces. The capturing piece and the threatened piece stay on their own squares. Example a white piece and a brown piece stand two squares apart. They have two balls and three balls respectively. It is whites move and white can remove the three brown balls from the game as long as there is no piece between the white and brown pieces. Pieces whose balls have been captured can be activated again by the sharing of balls.&#10;&#10;Therefore, capturing only limits the movement possibilities, the number of pieces always remains the same. If a player loses all their balls they can no longer move and have lost.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Prince of Chaos: Battle for Tae Orn is a Dark Fantasy strategic and tactical wargame. Play as one of four Princes, each with unique strengths and weaknesses. Accumulate resources by exploration, building mines and temples, and fighting for key positions. In addition to resource and strategic management, you also manage the details of your units&rsquo; Formations, Fatigue, Damage Levels, Rank, Ammunition, etc. The combat dynamics revolve around a richly detailed and heavily researched simulation of the four primary weapon systems of ancient warfare: Light Infantry, Heavy Infantry, Light Cavalry and Heavy Cavalry. Learning how to use each unit to maximum effectiveness is paramount to achieving victory. Additionally, unique fantasy units, including flying units, as well as a variety of spells from Enchantments, Curses, and Area of Effect are included. The game comes with highly detailed Record Sheets customized to each Prince&rsquo;s units in order to track the various in-game details.&#10;&#10;Though random events add flavor to the game, luck has been minimized to emphasize strategy and tactics. Battles do not hinge on the outcome of a die roll, but rather reward planning and superior positioning. A modular game board provides new terrain configurations every time you play, and terrain plays a key element in how you develop your strategy and tactics as terrain effects are customized for each unit. Each Prince has their own unique and highly detailed handbook describing each of their unit types in great detail, and each unit is further broken down into easy-to-reference sections within the handbooks. Unlike many games where you wait for another player to complete their turn before taking your own, this game is designed to keep everyone equally involved during all aspects of play, including the Movement and Attack phases. Though not recommended for the casual gamer, Prince of Chaos: Battle for Tae Orn provides a robust challenge for anyone who desires to plumb the depths and details of ancient fantasy warfare.&#10;&#10;",

Each player takes on the role of one of 12 transient characters who stalk the back alleys and gutters, rifling through dumpsters in search of valuable trash.&#10;&#10;Whether you&rsquo;re a crust punk, a hobo rail-rider, a trust fund poseur, or Woody Guthrie&rsquo;s actual ghost, all players have the same ultimate goal: rootin&rsquo; around in the trash til you&rsquo;ve collected the booze, smokes, snax, and dope you need to summon the TRASH LORD and be anointed his one true glorious Trash Child.&#10;&#10;Players can take up to 4 actions on their turn (skitch from venue to venue, dig for things in the dumpsters, trash cards from their hand to take advantage of special actions, stash things they've collected in the Squat, sacrifice cards for special &quot;blessings&quot; from the Trash Lord, panhandle to get more HP, and more). The first player to have all 4 things (booze, snax, smokes, and dope) in their stash and play a SUMMON card at the Altar wins the game.&#10;&#10;Each dumpster is different, and some more dangerous. Digging deeper can yield more rewards, but it&rsquo;s also askin&rsquo; for trouble. This town is lousy with cops, and the nefarious garbage critters known as Trashlings are waiting in the shadows to swipe your beautiful junk. Even your fellow street urchins might just get wasted and jump you if your stash is lookin&rsquo; a little too tempting. If you run out of HP, you're dead. Players must carefully manage their turns and constantly be on the move (and on their guard) as they booze, scrap, panhandle, and race to be the first to summon the TRASH LORD (peace be upon him).&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "(from the Decision Games web site:)&#10;&#10;Luftwaffe is an update of the classic Avalon Hill game covering the US strategic bombing campaign over Europe in World War II. As the US commander, your mission is to eliminate key German industrial complexes. You select the targets, direct the bombers, and plan a strategy intended to keep the Luftwaffe off-balance. As the German commander, the entire arsenal of German aircraft is at your disposal against the finest in Allied designs. Turns are quarterly, with German reinforcements keyed to that player's production choices. Units are wings and squadrons, and they're rated by type, sub-type, firepower, maneuverability and endurance. There are rules for radar, electronic warfare, variable production strategies, aces, target complexes, critical industries and diversion of forces to support the ground war. Beyond that, the original, classic game system remains essentially sound and hasn't otherwise been changed much. Most of the upgrade was in adding in additional rules, revising the order of battle, and adding more deployment and industrial options.&#10;&#10;The reverse side of the units now represents a condition of loss of effectiveness, rather than loss of material strength. That's due to a combination of factors: damage to aircraft, an infusion of novice pilots, or to veteran crews suffering combat fatigue. Historically, pilot training and morale were critical factors, and the game now shows that. Replacement points represent not only new aircraft but also logistical support, rest and relaxation time for aircrews, all of which are used to restore fatigued units to good morale. Fatigued units count the same as veterans for stacking on the assumption that a shot up or novice unit would be more difficult to coordinate in the air.&#10;&#10;The orders of battle are much the same as in the original game, though the German player now has to plan ahead if he wants to get jets. We added a US P-61 unit. While P-61s were historically used mostly as night fighters, the USAAF based two groups in France and used them as intruders, so they can be useful in attacking German airbases. The Americans also get a &quot;Droop-Snoot&quot; P-38. They were P-38s that had their guns replaced with a bombardier and were used as light bombers. While only a small number were built, they were effective as bomber-leaders, so they're included in this edition.&#10;&#10;The German player can now increase his ability to stack by expending fuel points, representing training pilots in large-unit formation tactics. The US player doesn't need to do that, since they had a much bigger training base as well as unlimited fuel. Since the Germans now get additional oil, owing to a more historic evaluation of the Ploesti fields, they can maintain an effective fighter defense as long as they can preserve that reserve of fuel.&#10;&#10;There are also other new targets on the map, such as the Germans' power generation grid. In the original game the US player had to bomb all the targets on the map to win. Given the way the victory point system now works, the Americans need bomb about four out of the five major target systems to win, thereby duplicating the historic result.&#10;&#10;",

The temple is filled to the brim with trinkets and traps, but you're most interested in the four royal jewels said to lie within.&#10;&#10;The temple you&rsquo;re raiding is shaped like a closed loop (i.e., a donut), and the top card represents your physical location within it. On each turn, you &quot;move&quot; through the temple, always forward, by moving cards from the top to the bottom of the deck. You can choose to explore (use a number card in either the top of the deck or second-from-the-top to move as many cards as its value from the top of the deck to the bottom), look around (turn over two top cards IF the top card is currently not revealed), mark a path (place the top card from the deck in a reserve pile, IF it is a number card), or return to a marked path (return a card from the reserve pile to the top of the deck).  Exploring and landing on a treasure makes you LOOT it, both adding to your score and thinning the deck to increase the density of traps (face-up court cards)! If exploration ever results in wandering into a trap, it's game over. You win once you get all four jewels and land on the exit.&#10;&#10;Loot the Loop is a solo adventure game playable in-hand with a deck of regular playing cards, inspired by other in-hand games such as Maiden's Quest and Palm Island, with rules created by Wil Su and made available free online as part of his &quot;Isaludo&quot; series.&#10;&#10;",

The game is set in a universe where the human home worlds of Viridia, Ironglass and Prime battle for colonies in the farthest reach of the galaxy. A fourth power, VASA, is the policing body of panhumanic space. It protects the interstellar space lanes and attempts to arbitrate between the ambitious and imperialistic home worlds. With the recent emergence of the alien Koralon race it remains to be seen whether humanity can put aside its petty rivalries and avoid falling victim to this new threat. &#10;VOID is a fast paced skirmish game, with the emphasis placed on enjoyable free flowing game play. It uses a unit-by-unit activation system that encourages strategic use of supporting troops, and prevents the game from becoming mired in hour-long turns. The game mechanics are clear and concise, allowing you to fight games ranging from very small skirmishes with only a few miniatures, to massive battles using hundreds of miniatures. Simple enough for beginners, the game system also has subtle depths that will provide a satisfying challenge for the experienced player.&#10;&#10;The VOID rulebook contains all the rules of play, an armory section and army lists for the four human armies: Viridians, Junkers, Syntha and VASA, as well as the mysterious alien race, the Koralon.&#10;&#10;A miniature line covering all five armies supports VOID. The models are manufactured in lead-free white metal and polyester resin. The range includes basic troops for the armies, support figures and characters, and larger kits such as the Tiger APC, a huge four-legged walking vehicle.&#10;&#10;Reimplemented By Void 2.0&#10;&#10;",

Once all dwarves have been recruited each player will be able to buy tools that they will be allowed to attribute to each of their dwarves. Those tools will offer them some abilities to help to gather more gold, mine more safely or to have more chance to escape this dangerous mine alive.&#10;&#10;Once equipped it is time to send them down the mine. Every player will place their dwarves in the mine, the deeper they go the more gold is to be found but the risks are greater.&#10;&#10;Then comes the time to search for gold, every dwarf will draw cards depending of where they are in the mine and collect gold nuggets depending of those cards. They will try to avoid the mine collapsing on them and then to leave the tunnel with the gold without getting stuck inside.&#10;&#10;After three rounds repeating those phases the winner will be the player that collected the most gold nuggets. Between each turn player will be able to keep the tools to have more choices to equip their dwarves the following turn and an event will happens at the beginning of each one to spice the game up, slightly changing the rules and the strategies.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",
