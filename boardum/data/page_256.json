Along with 6 different component cards which are required in different variations when casting a spell, this deck consists of 120 cards in total.&#10;&#10;Each class (round) players attempts to cast spells on each other and themselves to increase their grade (score). Each of these spells require the correct components in order to cast it. These components are drawn from the Shop Deck.&#10;&#10;Some spells are quick and easy to cast and only require 1 or 2 common components to be cast, however these only give the caster a small bonus. Other spells require rare or unique items to be cast and while this might take longer to obtain the right components, the resulting spell is far more powerful.&#10;&#10;If the spell is successfully cast, there will be some sort of effect and the player who cast the spell gains points.&#10;&#10;",

Between bullies stealing your lunch money, fights breaking out left and right, and schoolmates tattling to the ever-present nuns, a kid just can't catch a break ... or a kiss, as the case may be. Because you're a lover as well as a fighter, and all you really want is to steal a kiss from your sweetheart across the blacktop before the school bell rings and recess is over. The fact that you've bet the last of your lunch money on being the first do it makes it all the more risky. Of course, might makes right here on the playground. If you can't win your money back from the other kids, you can always beat it out of them.&#10;&#10;Recess is a strategy board game for three to five players. Players each start with two boy figures and two girl figures on opposite sides of the grid-marked modular board, which is dotted with playground-themed obstacles. Children move like a rook in chess, while nuns move like a queen. A child that lands on a space occupied by another child starts a fight and takes a coin from him. Other children can break up a fight by landing on that same space, or tattle by landing on a nun's space. If a nun moves onto the fight space, the attacker is sent back to the entrance for detention. Finishing thirty of the minute-long turns marks the end of the game, or it ends immediately when one player's boy and girl figures meet on the same space while out of sight of the nuns. The resulting kiss earns two coins from each player, but to win you still have to end up with the most coins.&#10;&#10;",

Once you blow off all 4 limbs (head, left arm, right arm, legs) of the opposing robot, you win the game. A unique stacking mechanic makes building your robot visually appealing and functions as an important part of the gameplay. Attacks and defenses are determined by die rolls. Years of playtesting with multiple teams across the country (Maine, Minnesota, Wisconsin and North Dakota) has developed the game into a highly competitive format that is appealing for hardcore gamers and still very fun for the casual gamer. Rule variations support new players and tournament rules for more hardcore players.&#10;&#10;",

There&rsquo;s only one thing to do &ndash; Fling Poo, in zero-gravity!&#10; Space Poo is a fast-paced game where players take on the role of monkeys on a space station in the middle of a poo fight. Your goal is to be the last monkey standing, who is also the cleanest one. Each turn, each player gets to draw and play a card, usually to either fling poo or clean himself off.  Out of turn, players have the opportunity to play cards to foil other players' poo flinging.  If you get covered in too much poo, you're out of the game and the last monkey standing wins.  But watch out! Things can go wrong on the station and they spell disaster if you don&rsquo;t deal with them.&#10;&#10;",

Hiring Nerds (engineers) creates better products, which attract more users, who in turn generate money. Hiring Suits (Sales) generates more money, which can be used to hire more nerds. At the end of every year the best products steals users from the other products during showdown. Employees initially are very eager to stay with a company, but over time are more likely to move to competing companies, unless they get further (monetary) incentives.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with 2-4 products (depending on how many players there are) and four event cards. The game is played over several years. Every year each product gets one turn, i.e. every player gets to play 2-4 times per year. Players adopts users, based on the number of engineers and a die roll. Then they earn revenue, based on the number of users and the number of suits. Third, the player can use money to hire more employees. Soon, no more new hires are available, and players must steal (or &quot;poach&quot;) employees from other players. The other players try to spend their money to prevent &quot;poaching&quot; from happening. During the product show down at year's end users shift towards products that invested wisely. Outside the regular turn order, event cards can be played by any player at any time, both to further their own objectives as well as to hinder other players.&#10;&#10;To win, a players needs to obtain the largest number of users. Players need a good mix of nerds and suits, and make smart decisions throughout the game. The constant back and forth over limited resources (employees) is different from many other resource based games and adds a lot of fun. The winning strategy depends to a large extend on guessing/reacting to other player's strategy.&#10;&#10;",

It combines the co-op strategy of tabletop games like Pandemic with the dynamic narratives of digital games like The Walking Dead, powered by Six to Start's own brand of app-driven audio storytelling.&#10;&#10;Players gather around a printed map of Abel Township, the home base of the Zombies, Run! universe. The map shows nearby towns, forests, farms, along with vital information about the location of zombies, supplies, and other settlements. Working together, the players embark on missions across the map, searching for supplies, rescuing survivors, and investigating the cause of the outbreak.&#10;&#10;But danger is never far away, with our unique real-time &quot;running&quot; card mechanic forcing players to use all their skill, nerve and co-ordination to survive. Will they reach their destination safely, or will they fall prey to the pursuing undead?&#10;&#10;During a mission, the players act as &ldquo;Runners&rdquo; sent out by Abel. Our companion iPhone/Android app uses audio and on-screen prompts to immerse the players in the game and story - informing them of threats, opportunities and events. Players can choose to investigate these, finding life-saving supplies, new storylines, or perhaps a hidden horde of zombies!&#10;&#10;Uniquely, players must react to situations in real-time, making tough decisions as the pursuing horde draws closer.&#10;&#10;The missions they choose and the decisions they make will constantly transform the game world and map. Settlements become overrun with the living dead and must be crossed out on the map, or marked with warnings. Hidden trails are found, opening new paths to explore and new secrets to uncover. Reports are heard on the radio of hordes moving in from the East - but how close, and how fast? The players track their story on the map itself, with annotations, stickers and counters turning the game board into an ever-evolving picture of the world.&#10;&#10;",

Dividing the center of the board is a streak of water, Stockholms str&ouml;m, which is impassable to human forces but not to the monster. Certain areas are also spawn points of police and military forces, that randomly enter the fight against the monster as reinforcements each turn. There are also civilian counters, i.e. monster food.&#10;&#10;The objective of the game is, for the monster player, to destroy a certain well-known landmark in Stockholm, including the old Tax ministry headquarters, the &quot;degenerate&quot; statue group Paradiset, the Royal castle et al. Before the game starts, the monster players chooses from a set of monster statistics that include which landmark it is to destroy, and also determines the monster start area. The objective of the human player is simply to kill the monster.&#10;&#10;Rules chrome includes the then renowned skinhead gangs of Stockholm that in the game are portrayed as violent, unkillable, and anarchist -- they randomly change allegiance each turn -- as well as the ceremonial palace guard, H&ouml;gvakten, at Stockholm Castle.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Introduction from the rules&#10; The following is a translation of the Swedish introduction from the rules:&#10;&#10;The Monster that devoured Stockholm is an exciting adventure game where tactics and good foresight are of great importance.&#10;&#10;The game is played by two players.  One is the &quot;monster&quot;-player who tries to destroy a certain part of Stockholm.  The other player is the &quot;human&quot;-player and controls Stockholms' military and police forces.&#10;&#10;The monster will try to reach its destination without being killed by defending humans. On its way, the monster may eat innocent citizens to regain its strength.&#10;&#10;The human player must try to figure out where the monster is heading and concentrate his military forces there while trying to reduce the casualties from innocent bystanders to a minimum.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Components&#10; The box contains:&#10;1 Gaming board 39x52cm&#10;2 Dice&#10;1 set of 60 cardboard counters&#10;&#10;(The rules is the only part of the game with Swedish text).&#10;&#10;",

Their task is to sit in an explosive-proof dungeon and through reverse-engineering examine various explosive contraptions manufactured by the necromancer's enemies. But the task to gain hands-on knowledge about what makes the devices go off and what damage they can do is no picnic, and not even a lifetime of resurrections can change that. The goblins want out and the only way to do that is to survive long enough to earn the gold coins needed to bribe their way out of their miserable situation.&#10;&#10;To win players need to keep their heads, perfect their timing, make every card count and, above all, make sure not to be the one holding the bomb when it explodes.&#10;&#10;Compared to the original game, Big Badaboom has five more bombs, five more mechanisms, and a new category of cards: the resurrection cards. These optional cards add even more slapstick humor to the game. The resurrection cards are placed in a separate pile, and whenever a goblin is caught in an explosion and resurrected, the player draws one card. On it the player will find an annoying, but hilarious, side effect that the goblin has gained for the next round as a result of the explosion. Finally, Big Badaboom comes in a stunning &quot;anarchist bomb&quot;-style case.&#10;&#10;Reimplements&#10;&#10;&#10;    Badaboom&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Each player draws a goal card of their choice and keeps it hidden. Flip the three-minute sand timer to begin play. To start, one player rolls all six dice, which have the numbers 1-6 on the sides with a different color on each side. Players then take turns in clockwise order grabbing and re-rolling as many dice as they wish from what lies on the table. If at any time the die results allow you to complete your goal card in hand, place that card on your &quot;completed goals&quot; pile, then draw a new card from the pile of your choice. Sample goals are have three dice with the same number, have three dice of the same color in sequence, have no visible red or black dice, or have a pair of a certain color and a different pair of a certain number at the same time.&#10;&#10;When the sand timer runs out, tally the points for completed goals. To make the game more challenging, you can shuffle all of the goal cards into a single deck or you can lay out 1-4 public special goals at the start of the game; if you fail to complete all of the special goals, then your final score is 0 no matter what else you do.&#10;&#10;",

Build fleets and caravans to control commerce in key cities and vie for rights of passage to your rivals' islands.&#10;&#10;Caravans of Ahldarahd is a boardgame set in a fantastic realm of desert kingdoms. Each player has a unique gameboard with a mix of advantages and disadvantages. As you plan your strategy, you must choose whether to secure monopolies in your own region or throw caution to the wind and deploy your traders to distant ports. Your deals with fellow players will ultimately determine your success or failure.&#10;&#10;The resources you need to build your trading empire can only be acquired by the highest bid, so you must balance fast expansion with longterm planning. If you strike too soon, your control may be easy to challenge. But if you wait too long, the game could end before you're able to fulfill your plans.&#10;&#10;In addition to resource and route management, players can bid for the favor of the mighty Shah, the zealous Eyes of Shamesh, and the mysterious Pirate Queen to secure special advantages. Meanwhile, each person's map can be invaded by any opponent controlling its Right of Passage card. The position of your allies changes from turn to turn, so those who ignore the political play can find themselves at a disadvantage.&#10;&#10;",

(which is a Polish version of Great Wall of China).&#10;&#10;The mechanics were wrapped into a theme of 70's and 80's in communist countries of eastern Europe. In this game players take a trip from Poland, travelling by popular in that time cars and try to collect a set of items bought in four (out of five) different countries. The countries presented in the game are: GDR (German Democratic Republic), Czechoslovakia, HPR (Hungarian People's Republic), Turkey and USSR (Union of Soviet Socialist Republics).&#10;&#10;Every round is an auction. The starting player takes one tile of a chosen color (country) and place it in the middle of the table. She then make a starting bid which has to contain at least one card of a matching color. The next player may present a higher bid or pass. After every bid or pass a player draws one new card from the deck and adds it to her hand. The player who already passed is omitted. The auction continues untill all but one player pass. The winner takes the tile, puts it in his car and starts a new round.&#10;&#10;The first player to collect a set of four tile in different colors is the winner.&#10;&#10;The game also features advanced rules. In this variant in order to win the players have to collect the four color set of tile with a value of at least 10. There are also action cards which can help to it's owner or mess up with other players' cards.&#10;&#10;Demoludy vs Gem Dealer - differences&#10;- In Gem Dealer starting player receives one card less than the others. Every player gets 5 cards at the beginning of Demoludy.&#10;- In Gem Dealer there is a rule that if you lose a bidding contest while using wild card 10, you lose one of your previously gathered gem. There is no such rule in Demoludy.&#10;- There is an advanced variant in Gem Dealer in which you have to gather 5 different gems, while in advanced variant of Demoludy you need 4 different items with a total value of 10 or more.&#10;- There are no action cards in Gem Dealer which are in Demoludy.&#10;- Demoludy also contains the expansion for Pan tu nie sta&#197;&#130;! (Great Wall of China): Bazar R&oacute;&#197;&#188;yckiego (which would be translated to: R&oacute;&#197;&#188;ycki's Bazaar)&#10;&#10;",

The cards are played face-down, however, allowing each player the opportunity to bluff by playing an illegal hand. Each player also has three liar chips that allow him to call another player's bluff. Players must use all of their cards as well as well as their chips in order to win.&#10;&#10;",

Alas, the adventurers' presence sets off a series of 3,000-year-old traps and they become separated inside a lethal maze.&#10;&#10;Turns out that the maze is of their own creation, though, as players take turns laying down tiles that show corridors, monsters, traps or equipment. They must reach a staircase exit in order to gain their freedom, possibly facing off against monsters while doing so and using the strengths of their four characteristics to survive.&#10;&#10;NB: Currently only in French, Spanish and Italian&#10;&#10;",

You can change suit by laying the same number as has been laid in the suit you lay down yourself. Also, the card numbered 20 (WHOT Card) can be used to change from a suit to any other suit at any time.  When the first person has finished, the others count up how many penalty points they have on the cards they have left in their hand. (Star cards count double as indicated by the second smaller figure in the small star). More recent decks also give the suits different colours, stars are blue, circles yellow, crosses red, triangles green, and squares purple.&#10;&#10;&lsquo;Whot! was invented (but, apparently, not patented) and trademarked by William Henry Storey, of Southend-on-Sea, England in 1935. It was first marketed by the company Storey &amp; Co of Croydon, which he set up in 1930, but was soon acquired by Waddingtons of Leeds, and was popular in Britain in the 1950s and 1960s.&rsquo;&#10;&#10;",
