During the game, players will try to gain Contracts by having the most money each round or by using Merchant&rsquo;s skills. The first player to gain a required number of Contracts is the final winner. There are 15 merchants (12 merchants in the 2018 version of H&#225;&#187;&#153;i Ph&#225;&#187;&#145;) with 15 unique skills and 5 Ship Cards. Players play a card simultaneously and compare reputation, the players who have the highest and second highest reputation merchant gain money while the lowest merchant triggers skill.&#10;&#10;Each round contains 4 turns (Player plays 4 out of 5 cards in hand). In a 5 player game, there are only 3 turns per round. Money and cards in hand are always hidden (unless the player is required to reveal it).&#10;&#10;Each Turn has the following steps:&#10;Put a card facedown - Reveal a card - Resolve and reward&#10;&#10;After finishing the last turn (the 4th turn in a game of 3-4 players or the 3rd turn in a game of 5 players), the round ends.&#10;&#10;All players reveal their money and the player with the most money gains 1 Contract card (the top one of the contract deck)&#10;&#10;H&#225;&#187;&#153;i Ph&#225;&#187;&#145; l&agrave; m&#225;&#187;&#153;t tr&ograve; ch&#198;&#161;i th&#225;&#186;&#187; v&#225;&#187;&#129; v&#196;&#131;n h&oacute;a Vi&#225;&#187;&#135;t Nam d&agrave;nh cho 3-5 ng&#198;&#176;&#225;&#187;&#157;i ch&#198;&#161;i.

That player now has two options: to accept your offer or to call you on your bluff and reject your offer.&#10;&#10;1. Accept: If they choose to accept your offer, they add the facedown cards to their hand. It's now their turn and they must now bid higher (meaning, more cards or the same number of cards of a higher number).&#10;&#10;2. Reject: If they choose to reject your offer, the offered cards are revealed and if the cards match the active player's offer, the offered player must add the cards to their stack of facedown cards in front of them. If the cards don't match, then the active player must place the cards in the facedown stack in front of them, instead. Either way, the offered player becomes the new active player and they must make an offer to the player to their left.&#10;&#10;The game continues until the deck is exhausted and one last bluff is called. Players now add any remaining cards in their hand to the stack in front of them and the player with the least amount of cards wins!&#10;&#10;",

The Christian church has also sent heroes to put down this obvious threat to humanity leading to an uneasy alliance between the Viking forces and those warriors sent by the Holy Church.&#10;&#10;Welcome player to the Gates of Niflheim crafted for you by the creative team at Raybox games. &#10;Within these pages you are invited to become involved in a heroic tale of Mythic Horror, that will test your wits and nerve in the proving grounds of a brand new Paths Unknown adventure.&#10;&#10;The innovative Paths Unknown game engine powers this system by seamlessly blending popular &quot;dungeon crawl&quot; style games with the storytelling and branching decision making of the choose your own adventure style books of the past.&#10;&#10;Paths Unknown creates a new hybrid method of play where the tabletop game experience no longer ends up sprawling across a giant table using a network of tiles and is instead contained within a book that keeps the focus to the play area representing your heroes current physical location within the adventure.&#10;&#10;Bound together within a spiral bind book designed to sit flat, the individual &quot;play pages&quot; of your Paths Unknown adventure will show the rules of the location your miniature must navigate on the LEFT page of the open book. As well as displaying the actual physical game board the model will move and fight on the RIGHT page of the open book.&#10;&#10;Paths Unknown is a non-linear adventure. Meaning the direction or EXIT your miniature hero chooses to leave a play page, will then decide which new page within the book they will travel to and experience, as the next part of their adventure.&#10;&#10;Each play page your miniatures travel to will manifest their own unique perils and challenges giving the model's the opportunity to gain new items, resources and skills, as well as perhaps finding new companions to aid them in their quest.&#10;&#10;Gates of Niflheim is the 3rd game in the Paths Unknown system and takes an exciting detour away from the Zombie infested trenches of World War 2 to venture down a path inspired by Viking lore!&#10;&#10;Yet again a team of extraordinary heroes must set aside their differences to confront a greater threat to humanity.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Tiles are numbered 1-14 in four colors, with each number appearing twice; special tiles show a &quot;swap&quot; symbol and &quot;+3&quot;. Six tiles are laid face up on the table, while the rest remain in the draw bag. On a turn, a player does one of the following four actions:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Draws a face-up tile, then replaces it with a random tile from the bag.&#10;    Draws a random tile from the bag.&#10;    Uses a special action tile to force an opponent to draw three tiles or force each player to give two tiles to her left-hand neighbor.&#10;    Plays one or more tiles.&#10;&#10;&#10;A player must first start a group in front of her by playing either a set of 3-4 tiles of the same number and different colors or a sequence of at least three tiles of the same color with numbers in ascending or descending order. Once a player has a group in front of her, she can play tiles on other groups already on the table as long as she doesn't create a set or sequence of only two tiles. A player can rearrange tiles and combine groups as long as no tiles remain on their own; if she combines groups, she can then start a new group.&#10;&#10;As soon as one player is out of tiles, the game ends and she wins. Alternatively, players can play multiple rounds, with those who still have tiles in hand scoring penalty points for what they still hold.&#10;&#10;",

If their roll turns out lower than desired, the player may pay a clue to roll an additional die to add to the value. If a player exceeds the witness value, the witness cracks under pressure and gives bad information, causing the offending player to lose two clues. After all players have rolled, the player who is closest to the witness value without cracking the witness gains clues equal to the number of dice they rolled.&#10;&#10;The game ends once any player gets 15 or more clues at the end of a round.&#10;&#10;",

Stones threaten towers - whichever color presents the greatest threat to a tower controls it.  Towers weaken stones.  The board is scored after each player's turn. Once placed on the board, a tower changes ownership back and forth as players try to gain control of it.  The beginning of the game is very open, the midgame very strategic and challenging, the endgame is often a &quot;grab&quot; for the final tower.&#10;&#10;More games can be played with the components of this game.

Taking on the role of a faction from the District 9 world, players vie for control of the district and its technological resources by interacting with the local population, iconic characters, and each other.&#10;&#10;The game unfolds over the 3 days in which the film&rsquo;s events take place. Players begin by setting up various district tiles to create a dynamic game board. A variety of different-shaped district tiles allow for the board to be unique each play through. Players then set up their starting tile at the edge of the district, simulating where they have strategically chosen to enter. Using orders to move their units around the board, and cards to augment their abilities, players lead their faction in a bid to salvage the biggest stockpile of alien technology.&#10;&#10;As the competition heats up, the unrest in District 9 escalates. Wikus&rsquo; actions during the prawn evictions, and the ensuing man-hunt, drive the stakes higher and higher until the climactic finale: when Wikus dons the prawn mech suit for his heroic last stand. The player who can weather the chaos of battle, and salvage the most alien technology, is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

Each track has a mission card for players to fulfill, for which they will receive victory points (VP); as mission cards are completed, you replace them from your own decks to help even the playing field.&#10;&#10;The Additional Story Mode which can be played from the base set and using expansions too will allow for collaborative play and street level adventures that can be a tie-in for the Cursed Empire RPG for side quests or build on the standalone card game from the Core Set I.&#10;&#10;Solo Play is also an option using the Core Set I.&#10;&#10;You can construct a deck to match your own playing style, using the components of the base game and card pack releases. Each character card has a &quot;character point&quot; value, which indicates both the power level of the character and the number of VPs required to win your match. The stronger your deck, the more VP you need. For clarity the Core Set has a great deal of replay-ability and you do not need additional packs to play multiple games. you can play out of the box without any prior deck construction as there are deck lists to get you started.&#10;&#10;The two-player Core Set I box of Heroes of Thargos Cursed Empire Card Game contains 210 cards with which players can build their starting decks:&#10;&#10;&#10;    33 unique Character Cards comprising key character types such as The Crimson Knight, Spider Darkun/Slayer, Cobra Sorceress, Kurnor Assassin and Karg Demon Summoner a&amp;nd all 17 bonus Kickstarter Character cards.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    66 Mission Cards all set in the World of Thargos.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    56 Lasting Cards comprising Thargos minions, objects, weapons etc. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    55 Action Cards comprising a host of Thargos creatures and player driven events.&#10;&#10;&#10;Two legal decks can be created from one Core Set I, although you would need additional Core Sets to create more specialized decks that use the maximum number allowed of some cards.&#10;&#10;",

After the battle of the Iron Gates against the Dark Mages, peace existed in our lands. But then Agrimor, a fire breathing dragon entered Lirennor and killed our king. The king's brother, an evil mage, tried to take power but he failed. He now seeks the Medallion Pieces from the heroes to seize the throne. But the heroes each require what Saladar, the kings brother has. Only one can be crowned the new ruler of Lirennor.&#10;&#10;1-7 players with competitive, solo and Co-Op modes to play. Three ways of winning as well as the ability to simply roam around killing creatures, completing side quests and interacting with the game in the open world setting.&#10;&#10;Select your base character and build them up as you go along by collecting, buying and winning weapons, items, equipment and so on. Equip these items and become more powerful.&#10;&#10;Use magical scrolls to manipulate the map itself. Twist the large hexagonal tiles around. Teleport across the land, conjure weapons, summon creatures, mitigate your opponents' attacks, enchant your items and so on. There are 150 scrolls in the game, so there's always something to do.&#10;&#10;The Box itself has been designed with fluidity in mind. Everything is organized as soon as you open the box. There are 500+ cards in the game all within their own tuck boxes. When playing players will use the awesome card trays designed to manage your inventory as you progress through the game and containing your cards to an easy to visualize battle board. And by far the most unique of all the features is the mechanical market located within the lid itself. Future expansion packs are already in mind and the box has already taken care of that. We have included extra room to store whatever is needed now and in the future.&#10;&#10;Dead Throne is a game that is never the same. With 10 large double-sided tiles, multiple paths to victory, loads of options and decisions with every turn, and an in-depth world to discover, you'll never say it's predictable.&#10;&#10;",

You bring equipment to each crime scene and use your equipment to generate effort, with which you clean evidence tiles from the crime scene. The more evidence you are able to clean, the less chance you give the police to catch you.&#10;&#10;The Cleaner is a game of playing cards to generate Effort cubes. You may then place Effort cubes on Evidence spaces, or combine lower-value Effort cubes to create higher-value Effort cubes. Once all spaces on an Evidence Tile have been assigned an appropriate Effort cube, you may remove that Evidence Tile from the play area. Each action you perform takes some time off the clock. You must play your Equipment cards as efficiently as you can, to cover as many Evidence spaces as possible.&#10;&#10;At the end of each stage, the police will conduct an investigation of the crime scene.

    "description": "Famous Divisions: Grossdeutschland Panzer, is the first in a new evolution in design that brings tactical elements to an otherwise operational simulation. Recreating four battles of the Grossdeutschland Panzer from the eastern front in 1943 and 1944, this first game of the series includes: Lutchessa Valley, Kursk, Akhtyrka and Mischurin Rog (each played on its own detailed and historically accurate map).&#10;&#10;The Famous Divisions Series offers a new concept: play is governed by the drawing of &quot;Event Chits&quot; during combat. Combat is not simply resolved by comparing the attack strengths and defense strengths of units as effected by terrain; rather, it's modified by random chit draws of over 140 possible &quot;events&quot; that introduce the elements of chaos and unpredictability to combat resolution. Event Chits can be nullified by other Event Chits; so players never know how an attack may be resolved based solely on odds ratios and terrain. The number of chits a given side may hold and draw also serves as an easy measure of its elite (or non-elite) status.&#10;&#10;Each hex represents approximately 500 meters from side to opposite side. Each game turn represents approximately six hours; however, the game turns aren't divided into separate friendly and enemy player turns. Rather, each is made up of numerous individual HQ activations. All HQ activation chits are placed in a cup, and each is drawn one at a time to initiate the activation (movement and combat) of a particular headquarters and its associated companies. When that HQ&rsquo;s activation is finished, a new HQ is drawn from the cup, and then its activation begins.&#10;&#10;Combat units are individual companies featuring distinct vehicles and weapons, which are shown as icons along with the numeric representations of the capabilities of the vehicle or weapon portrayed. Play is therefore tactical in many respects: units have individual range values, different movement capabilities depending on type (wheeled, tracked or leg), and rules cover such things as demolishing bridges, pontoon bridges, weather, overrun, supply, infantry riding tanks, direct and ranged fire, artillery barrages, opportunity fire, night, fortifications (bunkers, trenches, mines, dragon&rsquo;s teeth), engineers, armor recovery vehicles, airpower and anti-aircraft artillery.&#10;&#10;While not a purpose-designed solitaire system, the chit mechanisms make the series easily adaptable to such play, since the player won't know what chits may be drawn that could alter combat, or in what order the HQ activations will take place. Some examples of the 140 Event Chits are: Sniper, Good Commander, Ambush, Experienced NCO, Caught in Crossfire, Fanatic, Radio Out, Critical Hit, Frontal Assault, Elite Troops, Outflanked, Hand-to-Hand Combat, and Friendly Fire.&#10;&#10;Published in World at War magazine #20, Oct-Nov 2011.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 6 hours&#10;Hex: 550 yards / 503 meters&#10;Units: companies&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;Two 22 x 34&quot; full color mapsheets&#10;Two dual-side printed countersheets (560 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 32-page Gross Deutschland Panzer rulebook&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: Medium&#10;Complexity Level: Medium&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 3-20&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Astoria is two games in one : the board introduces a game named 'Combination Version' on one side, and another game named 'Epic Version' on its other side. Each version game puts the players in the role of powerful mages and alchemists, who are trying to find a cure to the strange and sudden illness that stroke the king of Astoria. The material included (four glass flasks, 60 shining gems in six colors, 66 cards) is used differently, depending on the game played.&#10;&#10;The Combination Version is team-played. By placing gems, players put in place the components that will make them able to produce one of many different magic components. Those components will be used as reagents in the cure.&#10;&#10;The players use alchemy powers to prevent the opposing team from putting their reagents in play, or to speed up their own production, in order to produce the best cure for the king and be rewarded accordingly. The game ends as soon as one category of gems is depleted, so it is important to delay the end of the game if your team hasn't found the best cure yet.&#10;&#10;The other side of the board presents a completely different game named the &quot;Epic Version&quot;, that includes more diplomacy and roleplaying features.&#10;&#10;Players are powerful mages trying to save the city of Astoria from three disasters : a barbarian invasion, a revolt, and the wrath of a powerful dragon. They develop their powers by creating magic items and putting them in play. Magic items are from six different magic sources, and each source can be used for a different effect on the city. The players use those magical forces to fight off the barbarians and defend the city from the besieging forces. The barbarian hordes will also be reinforced by war chiefs and sorcerers that will add to the pressure on the city.&#10;&#10;The players objective is still to find a cure to the illness of the king of Astoria. But some of the mages are also traitors, trying to lead the king to his final rest and give victory to one of the enemies of Astoria. Players have to watch each other, and may accuse another mage of treachery. They also have to keep an eye for the king's health, for if he dies, everything will be lost for the defenders.&#10;&#10;The game has different endings : the king can die, or can be saved. Or the city may fall to the hands of one of the enemies of Astoria. If one of the enemy factions comes to its maximal force, the game immediately ends with the victory of this faction (and, possibly, the victory of the traitor that was secretly supporting it!).&#10;&#10;Both the Combination and the Epic Versions use a scoring method that makes it possible for players to play the game in competition and tournaments.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "The 15X15 board has squares with slots on each side.  The four corners, start areas, are enclosed boxes with two exits each that hold your 4 pawns, one in each corner.  The middle nine squares comprise a large box with four entrances.  The goal of the game is to get all four of your pawns into the middle box (home).  In front of each entrance are fences that are set into the slots.&#10;&#10;On your turn you may remove one of your fences and place it in any slot on the board.  You then roll two dice and move one of your pawns the total or two of your pawns, each the amount of one of the dice.  Once a pawn starts moving it may not change direction unless it hits a wall or fence.  Upon hitting either the pawn moves at a 90 degree angle from the obstacle.  If you land on an opposing piece by exact count you send it back to any of the start boxes.  If you roll doubles you may take one piece and jump an adjoining fence instead of a move.  To move a piece to home you need it to enter at one of the entrances by exact count.&#10;&#10;",

The Beaumont Agency, staffed with a roster of brilliant, colorful, and ultimately &#239;&#172;&#130;awed private investigators, specializes in solving cases that no one else can crack.&#10;&#10;In The Dark Quarter, a co-operative app-driven adventure game set in a dark, fantastical vision of 1980s New Orleans, players each take control of a Beaumont agent and work alongside one another to solve the worst crimes that New Orleans has to offer. It's a world full of magic, where hexing curses are sold on every street, where voodoo priestesses and creatures of the night are lurking around every corner, and where even the most mundane crimes have a tinge of the supernatural to them.&#10;&#10;Through multi-scenario campaigns, the game tells a rich, dynamic story and invites players to make critical decisions that will not only affect their characters, but change the direction and course of the story. The characters are not simply avatars, easily replaceable from scenario to scenario; instead, they are woven into the very fabric of the story itself. Their destiny and the destiny of New Orleans are inextricably linked together.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Encounters: Bravest Warriors is a quick push-your-luck dice game set in the world of the Pendleton Ward cartoon. Players roll dice, assigning them to encounters to defeat those encounters and earn Heroic Points. After beating an encounter, the dice used are spent, and another encounter can be revealed, but the player must use only the remaining dice. Players can stop rolling any time they want, but if a player manages to use every single one of their dice, they can take all their dice back and keep going, with each encounter being worth double points! You can spend these points on later turns to buy item cards that can help you manipulate the dice.&#10;&#10;If you fail, other players can leap at the opportunity to &quot;assist&quot; you (using their items to help you win in exchange for half the points, and you can't refuse!) or just let you fail and ride on your coat-tails, picking up where you left off.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Roughly translated as 'Robbers', this abstract battle game was known to be played by the Romans, and versions of the same game may well have been played before by the Ancient Greeks and Egyptians, and afterwards by the Persians. Games archaeologists and historians disagree hotly about just about every aspect of this game: board size, number and distribution of playing pieces, use of a king piece, age, priority, etc, etc; the list goes on. However, there is evidence that the game existed, both in literature and in archaeological finds. All this disagreement suggests that, as the game traveled out to the far flung regions of empire, it was altered and developed by gamers and gamblers.&#10;&#10;The basic Latrunculi consists of 1, 2, or 3 ranks of opposing pieces (the number differs), on a board divided into squares of a single color; the board itself could be 8x8, 10x10, 12x8, or variations thereof.  The move of the pieces is a matter for discussion: the rook's move, queen's move, king's move from chess, or one square orthogonally have all been suggested.  Capture is made when a piece has opposing pieces on either side of it. The winner is the player who captures all his opponent's pieces, although variations have been suggested, such as getting two pieces to the opponent's back rail.&#10;&#10;As noted above, many variations exist, including a version recently discovered in Colchester (the Roman capital of England, Camulodonum), which includes a 'king' or 'standard' piece. Games of the Hnefatafl family are probably further developments of Latrunculorum. BGG members will no doubt have disagreements, opinions, and variations to add to this 'base-line' summary.&#10;&#10;Moshe Callen is credited as a designer on this game for his work in researching, developing, and formalizing the rules of the game based on historical data for the nestorgames version of this game.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "This near-future what-if wargame, designed by Ty Bomba, is an update and expansion of the classic old-SPI Oil War game from the mid-1970s. It has been released on the magazine Modern War. It examines an Iranian strategic alternative that&rsquo;s becoming increasingly plausible in light of the draw down of US military strength in the Middle East. That is, just as it did in Cold War Europe, the prospect of both sides having nuclear weapons in this &ldquo;zone of confrontation&rdquo; may work to create a deterrent umbrella that, at least for some time, could allow for a potentially decisive conventional war to go on underneath the threat of &ldquo;mutually assured destruction.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Oil War: Iran Strikes (OW) is a low-intermediate complexity design set in a timeframe of the near future &ndash; 2013 through 2017 &ndash; in which the Iranians may indeed have developed some kind of nuclear capability. At that same time, with the &ldquo;War on Terror&rdquo; having likely slithered to an indecisive end by then, and the US therefore likely fallen back into another post-Vietnam-type &ldquo;neo-isolationist&rdquo; phase, the possibility for a blitz-style Iranian conventional military victory &ndash; aimed at establishing and certifying Tehran as the hegemon of the Gulf region &ndash; moves to the fore.&#10;           &#10;OW examines the strategic and operational possibilities and parameters inherent in the opening Iranian offensive of such a war. There are no rules for the use of atomic bombs or other weapons of mass destruction (WMD). The situation is on such a hair trigger in regard to that aspect of things, if one such weapon were to go off, many more detonations would be certain to follow. The idea is for Iran to gain a victory without resorting to &ldquo;game changing&rdquo; WMD.&#10;&#10;Each hex on the map equals 18 miles (30 km) from side to opposite side, and its coverage stretches from Turkey in the north to the UAE in the south, and from the Iranian border and Persian Gulf on the east to Baghdad and Riyadh on the west. Each game turn represents three days, with a full match covering the first month of the war.&#10;Units of maneuver are corps, divisions, brigades, and US brigade combat teams (BCT) of various kinds, each containing from about 5,000 to 15,000 men and/or 50 to 400 armored fighting vehicles or helicopters. The most up-to-date data available have been used to establish each participant country&rsquo;s detailed order or battle, including the Iranian regular army (Artesh), Basij (martyr force) and Revolutionary Guards, along with the ground forces of Iraq (loyalist and insurgent militias and regulars, Kurds, and the &ldquo;elite&rdquo; Quick Reaction Force). There are also the armies of Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, the UAE, Syria, Turkey and, of course, the US.&#10;&#10;Special rules cover such things as: sudden death victories and victories on points, variable phase sequences, US naval supremacy, unique Saudi combat5 characteristics, geographic and multi-national movement and combat restrictions, US locking zones of control, US bases, Kuwaiti border defenses, Iraqi unit defections, Al Qods terror attacks, massed Basij suicide attacks, Basra&rsquo;s critical logistical status, Iranian airborne and marine units, artillery, combat engineers, airpower, UN intervention, unique US BCT capabilities, the legend of the 12th Imam, and much more.&#10;&#10;",

Or Snegurochka from the East.&#10;&#10;No matter where you are from, this game is meant for you and your friends and family. Although it is playable from the age of 8, for more experienced players we have included a 5 step guide on how to increase the complexity with variable player powers, set collecting and more.&#10;&#10;In this game you will take turns to do one of 3 possible actions: Crafting Presents, Summoning Creatures and Gifting Kiddos. With these actions you will unleash powerful abilities that can be chained for maximum effect and score joy as victory points, whoever has the most of joy, when a midnight card is drawn from either the kiddo or the creatures deck will win the game and earn the title: Gifter of the Globe.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

On your turn; you lay a tile, you replace from the draw pool, you replenish the draw pool.   The game continues until all the tiles are laid; though you can stop laying tiles if you want (to &ldquo;protect&rdquo; some of your own colours on show), but once you&rsquo;ve stopped, that&rsquo;s it, and other players can still lay theirs.   At the end, you score for any face-up tile of your colour, with bonuses for getting tiles adjacent.&#10;&#10;",

In the basic game, two, three, or four players control mining companies that mine asteroids for ore, gas, and highly dangerous shards of CT (contra-terrene matter -- a name for antimatter lifted from the Seetee novels of Jack Williamson). These commodities are traded for credits at the three major planetoid stations. Vicious fights can break out over control of particularly lucrative asteroids. The players have to agree on the winning conditions: The winner is either the first player to one million, ten million, or a hundred million credits, or the wealthiest player after a set timespan elapses. (The playing time is, accordingly, completely arbitrary; two hours is probably too short, but seems like a sane number.)&#10;&#10;In the advanced game, an additional player plays the Peace Keeping Force (PKF), whose role is ironically not to stop the fighting, but to suppress revolts and other conflicts just enough to keep prices of ore and gas low. The PKF player achieves partial victory if the price of either commodity is below 200 credits at the end of the game, or decisive victory if the prices of both commodities are below 200 credits.&#10;&#10;Includes: 480 counters&#10;&#10;",

The Merchant guild is ready to pay outrageous amounts of money, and all the Seekers roam about to find them. Breaking news! The surface of the &quot;forgotten planet&quot; on the edge of the galaxy is full of them. In a few days, a new gold race will begin, with men replaced by robots that search, explore and fight to control the precious mineral!&#10;&#10;The Forgotten Planet is a tile-laying management game in which tiles represent safe areas on a planetary surface on which robots walk and take other actions. These tiles also accumulate energy from the sun, then conduct it to robots, giving them (and the player) more actions if they absorb enough energy &ndash; so building and maintaining ownership of these tiles is fundamental in the game strategy. Players and robots use this energy to build new bases, discover mines, build walls to keep out other robots, push those same walls out of the way, produce more robots and much more.&#10;&#10;If your robot falls out of contact with tiles you control, however, then it loses power and falls inactive for the round. Control of tiles is determined by the distance from a particular tile to each player's closest base; whoever is closest to the tile (with walls serving as barriers that players must &quot;walk&quot; around while counting distance) controls it, and the more tiles you control, the more energy you have available to you.&#10;&#10;Thus, players need to maintain an energy connection for their robots while trying to extend their area of control on the planet's surface with their bases. They also need to control mines, of course, as that's how a player produces new resources, which are subsequently converted into new bases, sold for victory points (VPs) or converted into new robots.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the playing area is filled with tiles or no land tiles remain in the supply. (Players can &quot;consume metal&quot; as one of their actions to speed along the endgame and crimp someone else's efforts to keep building.) Players then score points for the land and mines they control, with bonuses going to the player(s) with the most robots in play, the most common mines and the most bases. The player with the high score wins.&#10;&#10;",
