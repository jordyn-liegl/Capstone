    "description": "The city was once a small and sleepy town, but the affordable properties have attracted artists, startup companies, and families. Celebrities and influencers are moving in, and after some recent archeological findings, the tourist industry is booming. Street by street, the city is transforming into a centre of culture and commerce.&#10;&#10;Players are investors creating attractive new streets in the growing city, investing in new businesses and homes. Some streets will become hotspots for hipsters, others will be dominated by tourists or families with children. Others still will become designated shopping areas. Where will your Microbrewery profit the most? What is the best location for a Toy Store? What kind of environments are the other investors creating, and can you exploit their work for your own gain?&#10;&#10;As each street is completed, the people on it will move to new buildings that interest them - hopefully one of your buildings in an up-and-coming street. Can you compete with the hype of your rivals and grow your following over time? To earn the most money and win the game you need to manage your limited investment funds cleverly, planning ahead while keeping your mind open to fresh opportunities.&#10;&#10;Streets is a tile-laying game where players build a city together. Each building has a simple valuation formula which earns money for the owner when the street is scored. Valuations are affected by the other buildings in the street, so smart placement is essential to maximise profit. On top of this, the city is populated by hipsters, families, shoppers and tourists, each with their own preferred building type. Cleverly located properties can benefit from the growing crowds of people who further increase the value of the buildings they visit.&#10;&#10;Optional expansion modules add powerful asymmetric player abilities, and extra layers of strategy &amp; tough decisions.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

If a player is paying for an action, they count as a resource. On the other hand, if played from the special stock each player has in front of them, then the marker color will instead define the action that is carried out. In each round the players receive new resources, can move on and discover an expanding map. Actions are carried out in two phases. In the first, resources are handed over in the central campsite to gain the rights to perform particular actions. In the second, these markers are then regained as action cubes to carry out additional actions with. Many actions will gain you victory points, the player with the smartest action selection and most points at the end wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "EastFront details the conflict between Germany and the Soviet Union during WWII.  Players have to contend with production, supply, command control and whether to try and break the other side's lines.  Several scenarios cover every major point of the war.  The game comes with a fantastic, detailed map of Eastern Europe and Russia printed on cardstock and many wooden blocks for the units.  This is a stand alone game that can also serve as one element of the complete EuroFront series which covers the entire European conflict of WWII.&#10;&#10;This title uses the Columbia Games Block system.  While there are variations in the rule sets, all of the &quot;Front&quot; series of games are based on the block system.  Basically this means that rather than using traditional counters to represent units on the map the game uses wooden blocks that stand upright with unit details only shown on one side.  This accomplishes two things:  First it provides an easy way of producing a &quot;fog of war&quot; because your opponent cannot tell, save through good memory or deduction, what type of unit a specific piece is or its current strength.  Second, having the blocks stand on end allows the possibility of rotating a block so the current strength is the top number.  Although most war games have some type of mechanism that allows units to take losses in steps of their overall strength, counters normally have at most two steps because they only have two sides.  Blocks, however, have four so you can easily keep track of twice the amount of detail that many other war games provide.&#10;&#10;With the use of blocks, Columbia has provided a way of adding a good deal of depth to their war games without adding complex layers of bookkeeping, allowing interesting and relatively short sessions of play.&#10;&#10;",

Your goal is to use the programs at your disposal to secure your access points so that they control as many of Titan's vulnerable accounts as possible.&#10;&#10;Most of the generic programs write pathways between Titan's various nodes, allowing you to place a blue partition between the nodes on the board.

They are no longer vulnerable to your opponents' programs, and you will score the accounts they control at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Android: Mainframe differs from its predecessor Bauhaus in a number of ways, such as each player having a hand of cards and the game including six runners who each have five distinctive programs.&#10;&#10;",

In this version everything is bigger, the players have boards with dry erase markers in place of the original paper and pencil.  This edition is also for up to 8 players instead of only 5 in the original game.  The biggest change in this edition, though, is that on the back of the regular player boards are the Qwixx Mixx boards that have the colors scrambled throughout the different lines, which changes many of the strategies while keeping the mechanisms largely the same.&#10;&#10;The rules for Qwixx:&#10;&#10;Qwixx is a quick-playing dice game in which everyone participates, no matter whose turn it is. Each player has a scoresheet with the numbers 2-12 in rows of red and yellow and the numbers 12-2 in rows of green and blue. To score points you want to mark off as many numbers as possible, but you can mark off a number only if it's to the right of all marked-off numbers in the same row.&#10;&#10;On a turn, the active player rolls six dice: two white and one of each of the four colors listed above. Each player can choose to mark off the sum of the two white dice on one of their four rows, then the active player can choose to mark off the sum of one colored die and one white die in the row that's the same color as the die. The more marks you can make in a row, the higher your score for that row. Fail to cross off a number when you're the active player, however, and you must mark one of four penalty boxes on your scoresheet. If you mark off the 2 or 12 in a row and have at least five numbers marked in that row, you get to also mark off the padlock symbol in that row, locking everyone else out of this color.&#10;&#10;When either a player has four penalty boxes marked or a second color is locked, the game ends immediately. Players then tally their points for each color, sum these values, then subtract five points for each marked penalty box. Whoever has the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;",

Finally, you drop all the cargo onto the playing area by bouncing it off the octopus' head.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player uses their flag to either navigate &mdash; by flicking the anchor next to their ship, then moving their ship to touch the anchor &mdash; or flick cargo. Cargo comes in five types &mdash; goblet, chest, gem, gold, and captain (yes, really!) &mdash; and you can flick any type of cargo that's not on your ship toward your ship. The only exception is that you can't flick the single cargo item closest to your ship. If the flicked cargo misses your ship, your turn ends; if it hits your ship, you load that cargo, then advance the cargo tracker, which is a string of beads on the perimeter.&#10;&#10;If you advance a black bead on the cargo tracker, the octopus attacks!

When cards are removed, they are replaced with a new one from the top of the deck. Victory points are earned in three ways: first, each card purchased is worth one or more victory points; second, victory points can be gained by defeating monsters with a power resource featured on several of the cards; and third, some cards give victory points directly each time they are played.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Nottingham 1100 A.D.: The True King is away in the Holy Lands and the town is under rule by the evil tyrant, Prince John. He has forced matrimony upon Maid Marian and locked her in his castle against her will. The young princess sends word of her captivity to fabled outlaw and her true love, Robin Hood.&#10;&#10;He vows to save her with help from his Merry Men &mdash; faithful souls who would follow him to hell and back! But this time, Robin sees doubt in their eyes. Little John, Will Scarlet and the other Merry Men deem the mission so perilous&mdash;it could plunge Nottingham into turmoil. Torn between love for the princess and his town, Robin devises a plan to save both! He proposes a challenge, betting his men that none can protect Nottingham as well as he. If one of them bests him at this task, he will bestow his mantle of leadership to the victor! They accept his wager, and pledge to rescue Maid Marian, no matter the outcome.&#10;&#10;Their quest will require bravery, cunning and all the wits they can muster! Will one of the Merry Men become Nottingham&rsquo;s newest hero, or will Robin live up to his own legend?&#10;&#10;Robin Hood and the Merry Men is a semi cooperative, but a highly competitive board game set in the folklore we all know and love. It&rsquo;s a thematic euro style game that perfectly blends worker placement, hand management, set collection and dice rolling into a one big exciting crossover.  &#10; In Robin Hood and the Merry Men, players take on the role of a famous outlaw such as Robin Hood, Little John, Will Scarlet and Jane Fortune, and their mission is to protect the town of Nottingham from the tyranny of infamous ruler Prince John and the notorious Sheriff of Nottingham throughout 5 rounds of onslaught. If they succeed, a winner is declared-the player with the most VP becomes Nottingham&rsquo;s greatest champion.&#10;&#10;Each round consists of two phases: A Merry Men phase and a Hero phase.&#10;&#10;In the Merry Men phase, you will call upon your faithful friends who are famous for their abilities to build and set various traps. In order to stay one step ahead, you will send The Merry Men to acquire resources and weapons, and lay traps to catch the Sheriff&rsquo;s endless army of Guards. Assigning Merry Men is done through playing Merry Men cards that offer variable actions.&#10;&#10;With King Richard being away on the Crusades, Prince John has given the Sheriff of Nottingham power to tax the villages in and around Nottingham, so you must order your Merry Men to build barricades on the roads to prevent the heavily guarded and gold-filled carriages from entering the castle.&#10;&#10;Before he went on his crusade, King Richard gave you certain tasks. In the midst of his struggles, he would welcome the news that his brave heroes have completed them.&#10;&#10;In the Hero phase you will send your Hero to fight the Sheriff&rsquo;s guards, ambush and rob the royal carriages of their treasures, enter archery tournaments, rescue prisoners from the castle&rsquo;s darkest dungeons and much much more.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "WWI has ended, but the battle for democracy has just begun. Communist movements have sprung up throughout Europe. Trotsky, Lenin and Stalin plan to blast through Poland in order to support the red revolutions in Germany, France and England. Only the armies of Poland stand in the way of the Bolshevik tide. Strike of the Eagle models the battles and historical events of the Polish-Soviet War of 1919-1920.&#10;&#10;To simulate the tension of the era from the fog of war, players alternate placing secret orders on their armies in order to bluff, mislead and misdirect their opponents. These concealed orders make it difficult to deduce an opponent's plans and are used to hide a player's true intentions and objectives. Players then reveal and resolve the issued orders. They can then disrupt their opponent's moves, cut off supply and much more. Once orders are resolved the next turn begins.&#10;&#10;Units are represented by wooden blocks. Battles are fought with no dice, but with a simple and quick combat system.&#10;&#10;Action cards are pivotal to the game in that they allow players to either modify how many orders they may issue, add army reinforcements or modify a battle's resolution.[...]&#10;&#10;Strike of the Eagle includes several scenarios for 2-4 players. Some are short games that can be played in an hour, up to the full campaign that can last several hours.&#10;&#10;The map portrays a portion of Eastern Europe in 1920. It is divided into areas that are named after local cities to simplify scenario setups. Along the outer edge of the map is a grid to help find areas during game setup. Each area name is followed by its grid location.&#10;The map is divided into two fronts; the northern and the southern. The front line is designated by a yellow line that runs from east to west. In 4 player scenarios, each allied player commands blocks on one front only. If a block of one player crosses the line between fronts, it moves to the control of his ally at the beginning of the next Operation Phase.&#10;&#10;The Fog of War series is a card driven game where Divisions and Brigades are represented as blocks. These blocks stand upright during the game to prevent opponents from knowing their strength or unit type and can only be revealed during combat or through Recon Area orders given during each Operation Phase.&#10;&#10;Strike of the Eagle is divided into a number of Rounds, each Round being subdivided into a number of identical phases. The Round Phase Track marks the game's progression. Each round is divided into the Replenish Cards Phase, five identical Operation Phases, and a Reinforcement Phase.&#10;Each side has a pool of order counters to draw from. These order counters represent the various types of orders each unit or group may be given. These orders, which range from Forced Marches to Reconnaissance actions, allow the player to strategically manouver his Divisions and Brigades. Orders are placed face down, leading to guesswork and strategic anticipation on the part of your opponent!&#10;&#10;The sequence of placing and executing orders is determined by the player(s) with the higher initiative. Each front has its own initiative track. Initiative is gained and lost as the game progresses. Whether to place first or second is an important strategic element of the game!&#10;&#10;Strike of the Eagle is a card driven game. Each card is broken up into a number of different parts and each card can be played for either its event as listed in the body of the card, to increase the number of orders available in a phase (uppermost left), for the combat value on the card (uppermost right), or for reinforcements (lowermost left).&#10;&#10;Supply is important in Stike of the Eagle. If units are out of supply they will fight less well, take much greater losses, and lose the advantage of any Garrison which might be located at their city.&#10;&#10;(from Academy Games website)&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "In The Red Dragon Inn 4, you and your friends are a party of heroic, fantasy adventurers. You've raided the dungeon, killed the monsters, and taken their treasure. Now you're back in our homeland, and what better way to celebrate your most recent victory than to spend an evening at the Red Dragon Inn. You and your adventuring companions will spend the night drinking, gambling, and roughhousing. The last person who is both sober enough to remain conscious and shrewd enough to hold onto his Gold Coins wins the game.&#10;&#10;Now you've taken to the high seas aboard The Crimson Drake, a sturdy sailing vessel that the heroes you know and love use when their adventures take them to sea. Join the crew in the Captain Whitehawk's cabin for a pint and try to keep your sea legs!&#10;&#10;&#10;    Captain Whitehawk: Captain Whitehawk is the stalwart master of the Crimson Drake. She's a natural leader with years of experience and a wit as sharp as her saber. She&rsquo;ll take the crew to hell and back for adventure and loot, and make damn sure they have a roaring good time while they're at it.&#10;    First Mate Remy: An elf from faraway lands, Remy is an honor-bound swashbuckler who keeps the crew in line; he&rsquo;ll be the first to step in and break up a fight. The seasoned sailors know to back down before they get on his bad side. &#10;    Bryn the Boatswain: Bryn is tough as nails and knows how to keep a ship afloat. When she's not making repairs or loading provisions, she enjoys sparring with the crew&hellip; all of them&hellip; at the same time...&#10;    Tara the Navigator: Tara was born blind, but with the gift of second sight. With her knack for seeing the future, she is an invaluable, if unlikely, navigator for the Crimson Drake. After predicting countless storms and monster attacks she has earned the trust of Captain Whitehawk and her crew.&#10;&#10;&#10;The Red Dragon Inn 4 includes a Sea Event Deck that provides a new way to play RDI. Instead of the relative safety of the inn, players are now partying in the Captain's cabin aboard the Crimson Drake &ndash; and because you're out on an adventure, the party runs the risk of being interrupted by random encounters. In game terms, at the start of the game you shuffle the Sea Event Deck and place it in the middle of the table with two Progress Counters on it. You then play RDI like normal, but at the end of each player's turn, that player removes a Progress Counter from the Sea Event Deck. When you remove the last Progress Counter, reveal the top card and an Event takes place. The Sea Event Deck adds a new level of complexity to the base game. Not only will you need to protect yourself from the other players, as well as the Drink Deck, but you may find yourself forced to defend against a Sea Event. You could even end up working alongside other players to get a bonus from the various Events you'll see throughout a game.&#10;&#10;",

The dice dictate how many of the balloon cards are needed of each color. (There are also optionally played Wild Cards to keep everyone guessing.) Each player decides whether they think the pilot will have the cards to successfully take the balloon up, or whether they should jump out and keep the points earned so far. If they stay, they run the risk of getting no points if the pilot fails. If the balloon does fall, it is placed back on the lowest cloud. Everyone hops aboard and draws one new card, and the next trip begins. When a player earns 50 points the game is over.&#10;&#10;",

To get rid of these fanged fiends faster than the neighboring villages, use your residents' special abilities and your powerful secret weapon: a silver bullet.&#10;&#10;Call for a vote when you think you have the fewest werewolves, but be careful; everyone else gets one more turn to save their own village first...&#10;&#10;Silver Bullet is a fast and engaging traditional card game with a werewolf twist! Everyone starts the game with five face-down cards, with everyone being able to see two cards of their choice. Cards are numbered 0-13, with the number showing how many werewolves the character on that card attracts, and each character (number) has a different special power.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you draw the top card of the deck or discard pile, then either discard it to use the power of the card (but only if it came from the deck), discard it without using the power (ditto), or replace one or more of your face-down cards with this card; you can replace multiple cards only if they bear the same number, and you must reveal the cards to prove this, being penalized if you're wrong.&#10;&#10;Silver Bullet can be played as a standalone game or combined with other Silver decks. Each version of the game has different card abilities.&#10;&#10;",

But hidden Luminaries and changing seasons can alter your plans. Featuring a cloth board, metal tokens, and illustrations by Carson Ellis.&#10;&#10;Illimat supports two to four players and a single round takes approximately fifteen minutes. The cloth board is divided into four fields, and the box the game comes in is also a component of the game: it sits in the center of the board and sets the seasons for each field, which affects the actions that can be performed in each field. Turning the box and changing the seasons is a critical part of the strategy of the game.&#10;&#10;Illimat has been playtested with devoted gamers and people who haven't played a game in years. The result is a game that's easy to learn, dynamic, and just a little bit addictive.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "(from MMP's webpage:)&#10;&#10;Angola recreates a brief portion of the violent, decades-long Angolan civil war that began in the 1970s with the fall of a colonial power and dragged its bloody way into the 21st century thanks in part to cold war politics.&#10;&#10;Angola is a multi-player game in which players control the various Soviet- and US-backed factions that vied for control of Angola from 1975 to 1976. Originally released in limited quantities by Ragnar Brothers of the UK, Angola quickly became a rare and highly sought after game of almost cult status. Why? Angola features a number of innovative game systems that keep players guessing, create plenty of tension, and reward the right balance of boldness and caution. MMP is now updating this classic with the fabulous graphics of the IGS line of games and bringing it to a wider audiences.&#10;&#10;The map is divided into areas, and units represent military formations and also special weapons, such as artillery, rockets, tanks, and airplanes. A unique command and activation system has players committing in secret to the order in which they will activate a limited number of their units for the turn. The players then take turns activating their units in the determined order. The result is like a tense game of poker, with players trying to analyze the map and out guess their enemies.&#10;&#10;The game is finely balanced, and all players frequently feel as if they are simultaneously on the verge of victory or defeat thanks to an ingenious victory point system that rewards good play for both sides and allows players to absorb reversals and strike back with the right countermove.&#10;&#10;Angola contains:&#10;    2 decks of cards (110 total)&#10;    32 page full-color rulebook&#10;    2 player aid cards&#10;    22&quot; by 34&quot; inch map &#10;    3 countersheets &#10;    4 six-sided dice&#10;&#10;Developer: Adam Starkweather&#10;&#10;",

The building tiles correspond to roads, factories, shops, parks and of course, homes.

Players earn points for tile-placement combinations and for the completed bonus point tiles around the edge of their board.&#10;&#10;&bull; Roads wants to connect to an edge of the board.&#10;&bull; Factories wants to be next to other factories and roads.&#10;&bull; Homes want to be placed in clusters that are as small as possible &mdash; the smallest being a single tile &mdash; so long as they're not next to a factory.&#10;&bull; Parks wants to be next to homes and factories.&#10;&bull; Shops score increasingly more the closer they are placed to the city center, but if they're not placed on an edge, they need to be adjacent to a road connected to the board's edge in order to score.

    "description": "Another challenging game of Gods, men, and their monuments from Reiner Knizia!&#10;&#10;The game spans 1500 years of Egyptian history. The priests of Ra seek to extend their power and fame. They do this by directing farmers, warriors, merchants, and scribes. They cause others to build granaries, fortresses, markets, and libraries. And they erect a gigantic pyramid for the glory of the Sun God Ra!&#10;&#10;This game is a rework of Ra, with most of the same rules but completely different scoring tiles that come up for auction, some of which are two-sided, requiring players to choose which side they will make available for themselves... and for their opponents.&#10;&#10;Board &amp; Pieces: The Board has 2 tracks, effectively time and auction.  Also there is a space between the two track for a spare bidding tile.  In a bag are all the Collectible tiles, some double sided, consisting of Sun of Ra, Priests, Plagues, People, Buildings &amp; Pyramids.  Bidding Tiles, used to win auctions.  Auction Token, used to show active player to maintain play order.&#10;&#10;Play: The game is played over 3 epochs (rounds).  Each round ends when the Sun of Ra (time) track is filled.  &#10;Any non Sun tile is placed on the Auction track, in the case of double sided tiles the active player decides which side to use.  Auctions can either be called by a player (instead of drawing a tile), or automatic when the auction track is filled.  Each player may make one open bid, or pass.  The winner takes the tiles in the auction track and swaps his bidding tile with the one in the middle.  If all players pass (for example to avoid Plague tiles) then these tiles are taken out of play.&#10;&#10;Scoring: At the each epoch VPs, or Ankhs, are awarded for most of a type or a variety of People &amp; Buildings.  Penalties are awarded for Plagues (which can be offset by a number of Priests).  People and Priest tiles are then taken out of play, Buildings, Pyramids &amp; Plagues are carried over into the next epoch, so can be scored again.  At the end of the 3rd epoch, Pyramids are also scored by construction height and tiles used.  Ankh collections are now converted to points.  Finally a bonus &amp; penalty is also awarded depending on a players bidding tiles.&#10;&#10;",

Your token moves around the perimeter of an array of cards (ingredients) and you pick one from the row or column where you stop.  The number on the card you pick dictates how many spaces you move on your next turn.  You try to collect sets of four matching ingredients and get penalty points if you have only one of a particular ingredient.  The scoring rules can be made more complicated if the players desire, but for most the basic rules are satisfying.  A touch of memory is involved since you can see only the last ingredient you picked up on your stack of cards.&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Summary&#10;Create a 6x6 grid of ingredient cards (numbered 1-4, 14 ingredient types; 2 each in 5 colors, and the player colors black and white) minus the corners. Place the 2 player pawns on opposite corners. Each player gets a random card (not of their color) in front of them. For the advanced game, players also get 2 recipe cards = bonus points at end of game if you meet the conditions (e.g., at least 3 cards of both ingredients in a color; fewer 4s than the other player, etc.).&#10;&#10;On your turn, move clockwise as many spaces around the grid as the number showing on your card stack, then take a card in that row and place on top of your stack (may never look through your stack) -- if land on corner, get nothing. Place the top card from the draw deck in the empty spot. If you drew a card with a magic hat/wand icon, take a second turn (max 2 consecutive turns). If you got a card with an exploding icon, the other player places their top card on the bottom of the draw deck (if deck empty, remove card from game instead).&#10;&#10;The game ends when any row is empty. Then sort your cards by ingredient type and score according to number of each type:&#10;- 1 = negative points&#10;- 2 = 0&#10;- 3 = sum&#10;- 4 = sum + 5 (i.e., 15 VP)&#10;- then, if in your own color, double the value&#10;- score any bonus points from end-game recipes.&#10;Most points wins!&#10;&#10;",

Each family has a value ranging from 1 to 9, which indicates both the number of cards in the family and the number of victory points the player controlling this family will score at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;A game lasts exactly eight turns, and on each turn a family grants its specific power to the player controlling it. Thus, efficient handling of these powers is the key to success! While their influence increases turn by turn due to the number of authorized cards in their council, the number of cards drawn each turn dwindles, making choices all the more difficult.&#10;&#10;",

Natives!&#10;&#10;The Maitre d'Hotel notes as best as he can all the orders from the waitress, and constantly repeats them to the cooks. He has the pivotal role of the restaurant, he makes the link throughout the game between the room and the kitchen and is responsible for coordinating and managing the whole.&#10;&#10;Each Cook manages types of food by having the piles of corresponding cards, and is also the expert cook of a continent: he thus has all the cards of this continent. Each of these cards corresponds to a language and includes the six dishes that are served in that language.&#10;&#10;Each dish is written by a transliteration (as it is understood in French) and accompanied by the name and drawing of one of its ingredients. When a cook has found a dish on a card, he asks the others for the necessary ingredient (if he does not have it himself) and gives these two cards (language + ingredient) to the head waiter. The latter therefore adds to these two cards the appropriate table card (which he would normally have noted down!) and gives everything to the Waitress. As soon as the Waitress can, she will serve the table on the app by selecting the table in question, then the right ingredient, then the right language!&#10;&#10;So, satisfied customer?&#10;&#10;[kosmopoli:t] is scalable! Initially you will have access only to level 1 and will have to unlock the other levels! Then you can open the latest deck of cards with new ingredients and new languages! The game has a hundred goals to achieve and scores to pulverize! The game is also full of surprises, with some levels having an inspector from Guide Michelin, some having nonexistent dishes to discover, and some having things still to discover...&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Now, sacred sites across the land have been defiled and plundered by the disgraced wizard Mortibris, who along with his vile undead minions will stop at nothing to obtain the secrets of Valandor&rsquo;s power.

The Dwarf, on the other hand, is steadier as his thick armour can resist most attacks. The Elf is not as skilled a fighter as either of these, instead preferring to stay at a distance where her finely-honed archery skills can best be used. Finally, there is the wizard -the others may laugh at his lack of fighting skill, yet it is often his magic that carries the day. If the others can keep him alive, that is.&#10;&#10;This core set will be supported with a raft of expansion products as time goes on, adding new challenges and game modes to your Dungeon Saga. The first of these will be Adventurer's Companion which will add an AI system for solo and fully co-operative play, the ability to create unique characters from scratch using any model in your collection, the tools you need to design your own dungeons and much more!&#10;&#10;",

The Robber, however, sits freely on the board, and, as you need somewhere to throw the dice, you may prefer a table upon which to play the Travel Edition (although the box top or box insert could be used as a dice tray).&#10;&#10;&#10;Belongs to the Catan Series.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Band of Brothers is a fast playing game of squad level combat in WWII.  It covers the exploits of the 101st in their battles from D-Day through the Bulge. The rules are very simple (no combat charts are needed) with very few exceptions to remember and yet the game is meant to be all encompassing and will include infantry, tanks, and artillery.&#10;&#10;Based on years of research, the game system uses a unique suppression mechanic.  There are no longer two unique states for a unit, but varying degrees of suppression.  This allows suppression to accumulate from multiple fire sources and means that the unit will not take a morale check until it is asked to do something.  You will never know for sure how your units will respond until they are needed.&#10;&#10;Although casualties can be caused by artillery and heavy weapons (which makes them prime battlefield targets), squads will never cause significant casualties shooting at range at dug in, first line troops.  Their goal is to fire and maneuver.  Sections of the enemy force must be pinned down and eliminated from up close.  The system itself forces this realistic play.  In a similar fashion, the system rewards you for spreading your troops out and other realistic game play.&#10;&#10;Another unique feature of the game is its use of Proficiency and Casualty ratings to differentiate squads in areas besides just morale.&#10;&#10;The game is the first in a series.&#10;&#10;Band of Brothers: Ghost Panzer is a stand alone game that is set on the Eastern Front and follows the German 11th Panzer (Ghost) Division&#10;&#10;Other games under research are &quot;The Old Breed&quot; (the US 1st Marine Division) and a module that follows Commonwealth forces.&#10;&#10;",

The ultimate goal is to earn more points than your opponent, primarily by undertaking construction tasks but also by maintaining an impeccable public image and adhering to the decrees of the New York City Council.

As you and your foes journey around the board, you will subdue strange creatures and fulfill fabulous quests.&#10;&#10;Each creature you encounter has both an ability and a vulnerability.

A defeated Enchantress will wield her beguiling charms to help you overcome wandering Knights. Knights in turn subdue Dragons, adding their fiery breath to your cause. By combining the powers of different creatures you can fulfill curious quests, for example:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Send forth your Rabbits of Unusual Size to Nibble Through the Violin Strings of the Violent Vampire Volnar!&#10;    Deploy a party of web-slinging Spiders to String a Bridge Across the Chasm of Chaos!&#10;    Send your Dragons and Vampire Bats together on a mission to Ignite the Whisker-Wick'd Candle Guarded by the Ice Cats of Kituviel!&#10;&#10;&#10;Some of the creatures you encounter carry precious gems, which you can spend to purchase powerful artifacts or to summon mythical beasts to your aid. You begin with a handful of household items, but you will grow in power as you adventure and gather allies! By completing quests you score victory points and claim other special rewards. The board changes every time you play, so prepare for a new, exciting adventure each time you enter the world of Fantastiqa!&#10;&#10;Fantastiqa is easy to learn but challenging to master &ndash; a game for families and gamers alike.

Using the numbers revealed by the cards, all players fill up their subway map with Xs in the station spaces. However, the number of times they can add stations to each line is limited, so they have to make tough choices. Players can score many points by getting their star bonuses in stations with many intersecting routes. Players also get bonuses by being the first to complete routes. Try to fill in all your stations to minimize the penalties and achieve a high score!&#10;&#10;In more detail, each player has their own sheet of paper, with the game including subway maps for Amsterdam, Berlin, Paris, and Madrid, with the first two being recommended for new players. Each sheet shows an interwoven subway system, with the system consisting of many subway lines; each line has a name, a number of indicator boxes, a number of empty station boxes on the subway route, and two bonuses. On a turn, a player reveals the top indicator card from the deck of fourteen cards, then each player individually and simultaneously chooses a subway line, then does something depending on which type of card is revealed:&#10;&#10;&#10;    If a number is revealed, the player writes the number in one of that line's indicator boxes, then draws a X in each box in the line starting with the closest empty box, stopping when they've reached the end of the line, reached an already filled-in space, or drawn the indicated number of Xs.&#10;    If a circled number is revealed, the player does what is described above, but they can skip over already filled-in spaces instead of stopping.&#10;    If a star is revealed, the player draws a star in one of that line's indicator boxes, then in the closest empty space on that line they write a number equal to double the number of lines that pass through that station box.&#10;    If a circle is revealed, the player writes nothing in an indicator box and draws a X in any empty station box.&#10;&#10;&#10;At the end of a turn, if a player has finished a subway line by reaching the final space, they announce this to all players, then score the larger of the two bonuses for this line; all other players cross out the large bonus and can score the small bonus for themselves if they complete this line later. Multiple players can score a line's bonus on the same turn. If the indicator card has a shuffle icon on it, shuffle all of the indicator cards together before the next turn.&#10;&#10;Once all the indicator boxes are filled, the game ends. Players tally their points scored for completing lines and for writing numbers in boxes, then lose points based on the number of empty spaces that remain on their sheet. Whoever has the highest score wins!&#10;&#10;",

One player plays Caesar as he attempts to gain wealth and fame in Gallia at the expense of the Gauls. The other player controls all the independent tribes of Gaul as they slowly awake to the peril of Roman conquest.&#10;&#10;Caesar: Rome vs. Gaul  uses many of the core rules and systems used in Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage.

You must work around the weather and the extinction of natural resources as well as negotiate deals to protect your wives while you decide between monotheism or polytheism. In this tableau-building game, you'll send your population out to hunt native species of Greenland &mdash; but some might not come back. (Historically, the climate turned frigid and all but the Thule (Inuit) died out.)&#10;&#10;In the game, play takes place over six phases; all players complete each phase in turn order, then the next phase starts. Each turn is one generation. In order:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Resolve events: Examples include elder deaths, animal migrations, feuds, or global cooling. If a trade ship arrives, an auction is held for its wares. &#10;     Assign hunters: Hunters are assigned to hunting grounds, resource gathering, colonizing the New World, raiding other tribes for wives or animals, or promotion to an elder.&#10;     Negotiate: Players can bribe others to peacefully withdraw hunters, including marrying them to their daughters. Players with a War Chief Elder can use hunters to attack others on the same card. The New World turns hostile if there are too many colonists.&#10;     Resolve hunting: Roll a die for each hunter and modify it for technologies and marriages. Success can result in gaining new hunters, resources, hand cards, wives, and/or technologies. Beware, as some animals can be confused by the prey-predator relationship and your hunters might not return. Some successes let your take cards from the central play area into your hand if within hand limit. &#10;     Maintain livestock: Pay to keep the animals you've already domesticated.&#10;     Take elder actions: Examples include invention, domestication, proselytization, and witch-burning. If you have no elders, you can convert to monotheism.&#10;&#10;&#10;Depending on each player's ending theistic worldview, he has a variable scoring based on successful hunts (polytheism) or resource gathering (monotheism).&#10;&#10;",

Next, you roll the dice, which show 1-2-3-4-7-X on one dice and 1-2-3-5-6-X on the other. After your first roll, if you roll doubles, move your pawn 1, 2, or 3 spaces based on what you rolled. You then treat your dice as a two-digit number, say 31, 22, 54, or 70, with the X counting as a 0. You can stop and place your dice on the ranking chart in an empty space &mdash; it contains six spaces numbered 0-5 &mdash; or you can roll again. If you roll doubles, you advance you pawn and face the same choices. If you roll an X or two Xs, then your turn ends and you move your pawn back one or two spaces.&#10;&#10;When you place your dice on the ranking chart, if you place your dice on a lower-numbered space and your two-digit number is equal to or larger than dice that are on a higher-numbered space, then you bump that player's dice off the chart, which means they won't move at the start of their next turn. You can place any number on an unoccupied space, but the higher the space, the greater the odds of you being bumped before your next turn. How risky do you want to play?&#10;&#10;Rapido contains modified rules for two-player games, and you can play with these rules in any version of the game. Each player has two sets of dice, but still only one pawn. If at the start of a turn, you have one or both pairs of dice in front of you, roll like normal, advancing on doubles and hoping to avoid Xs. When you place dice on the ranking chart, you knock off only the opponent's dice, never yours. If at the start of your turn, both pairs of dice are on the ranking chart, advance your pawn the sum of the spaces occupied, then roll a pair of dice.&#10;&#10;",

Use your cards to win the jousting competitions, and to fight with your sword, axe or morning-star. Rally your squires, gain the support of a maiden, and play action cards against your opponents.&#10;&#10;Clever use of action cards can change the type of tournament that is in progress. One card will 'unhorse' you, forcing everyone still in the jousting competition to switch to a weapon battle of the action card holder&rsquo;s choice.&#10;&#10;Other actions cause you to drop whatever other weapon you are using and resort to hand-to-hand battles in which the player with the most cards- not the highest point total- will win a token. Depending on the number of players in the game, the first player to win four or five different tournaments becomes the overall victor.&#10;&#10;There is a lot more strategy involved in the game than first meets the eye.&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Attacke&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The deck is always on a slope where the luggage is put, so place carefully. If the ship tilts, the player has to take a ship's chest and add it their own luggage as a penalty. The ship tilts easily, so it's a race to load luggage before the ship tilts. If a player finishes placing all their luggage or the penalty chests run out, the game ends.&#10;&#10;Since each of the different luggage items is a different material like brass, aluminum, iron,

Each player uses sand timers as his pieces, and a turn is simply to move to an adjacent space, flipping the timer in the process.  The number of times that each space on the board can be occupied is limited, but the more central spaces can have more traffic.  The object of the game is simply to have any of your pieces movable when your opponent's pieces are either locked in place, or out of sand.&#10;&#10;This game was originally part of project GIPF.&#10;&#10;",

In this narrative puzzle adventure, an intimate coming-of-age story is told through an object that serves as a tarot deck, a puzzle game, and a work of art. You will need to manipulate cards, find hidden messages, and solve logic and word problems in order to uncover the deck&rsquo;s secrets.&#10;&#10;The tarot deck contains 78 cards--56 Minor Arcana and 22 Major Arcana, the latter of which each represent a puzzle. Puzzles are solved using sets of  Minor Arcana cards and clues from the story booklet and result in solution keywords that lead players to discover new pieces of the narrative. Some story passages grant items which can be later used to unlock extra scenes, and some puzzles have multiple answers, allowing players to unlock more of the story if they find all the solutions.&#10;&#10;Packed with gorgeous illustrations, resonant storytelling, and unique puzzles, The Light in the Mist can be played solo or cooperatively in a small group. It&rsquo;s non-linear structure and varied puzzle difficulty will engage players of all experience levels with over five hours of gameplay.

This open countryside is unspoiled by human hands, and it&rsquo;s your job to keep it that way. Make sure the tourists and campers have somewhere to go, but don&rsquo;t let their presence distract you from what really matters.&#10;&#10;In Naturopolis, 1-4 players work together to build a new landscape. Using only 18 cards and a variable scoring system, the game is never the same twice.&#10;&#10;First, players will randomly flip over 3 cards to see the scoring rules for the game. But not only do these 3 cards determine how you will score this game, they also determine how you win. Total up the values of all three cards, and that number is the scorethat you need to reach in order to win. Each game has drastically different scoring rules in unique combinations, and a new score to beat, ranging from 6 to 51 points.&#10;&#10;Each turn, players will play one card from their hand to the growing landscape, trying to score as many points as possible. Players will have to communicate and plan without revealing their own cards in order to most efficiently develop large areas in each of the 4 zone types. Watch out though, road maintenance isn't cheap and each road will cost you points in the end. This is doubly true with Naturopolis&rsquo; double-lined roads as they will cost you -2 points each!&#10;&#10;New to Naturopolis are the rivers, which occupy space the same way as roads but don&rsquo;t hurt your score. (But roads and rivers cannot connect!) It also adds camp sites, which score based on certain goals.&#10;&#10;When all cards have been placed, the game ends and players see if they have met the dynamically generated minimum score for their game.&#10;&#10;Can you work with your team to make the most of these natural wonders while still leaving space for tourists, campers, and other visitors? It&rsquo;s time to find out!&#10;&#10;&#10;Naturopolis is the 3rd game in our series of standalone and combinable Sprawlopolis games. It brings mountains, lakes, forests and meadow blocks to the game, with the added bonus of campsites (which trigger scoring conditions), rivers (which also trigger scoring conditions and cannot connect to roads) and double line roads (which are worth -2 points each as disrupting nature is very costly!)&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Grifters is a hand-building game that has all the fun of deck-building games, without the deck. Set in the Dystopian Universe, players take on the role of powerful crime bosses, building their criminal organizations by carefully recruiting new operatives with specialized skills and directing their team&rsquo;s nefarious deeds. All of your specialists are either in play or in your hand, ready to be used as you command. This unique hand-building mechanism gives you total control of your strategy.&#10;&#10;Grifters is all about stealing as much money as you can from the corrupt government, malicious corporations, and your rival players. Each player starts the game with a hand of six Specialist cards, each with unique abilities. Your objective is to use this team of six Specialists to recruit more criminals, complete jobs, steal from the government coffers and swindle your opponents.&#10;&#10;Each specialist has a special ability and skill. On your turn you can play a single specialist to perform their ability, or you can play a team of specialists to use their combined skills to complete a job. This means every specialist is a valuable asset to your criminal enterprise, earning immediate benefit through abilities and valuable end-game bonuses by completing jobs against the same target. And because all the cards in your deck are always available, you decide how to maximize your play.&#10;&#10;Grifters uses a unique card &quot;cooldown&quot; system to control the use of your cards. On your turn, you play one or more specialist cards into the first &quot;Night&quot; of your hideout. If you already have a specialist card, or a team of specialist cards, in night one those cards advance to night two and push other cards through your hideout.&#10;&#10;When a card is pushed out of the third night of your hideout it enters the refresh area. Any cards in your refresh area will return to your hand at the end of your turn.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the coffers run out of money, there are no more jobs left to complete, or if there are no more specialists cards left for recruiting. End game bonuses are calculated for completing multiple jobs against the same target.  The player with the most money wins.&#10;&#10;---&#10;&#10;The Grifters (1st Ed) was first released via Kickstarter with the following backer exclusives:&#10;&#10;Upgraded player tableaus - A thick chipboard tableau with linen finish will replace the cardstock tableaus found in the base game.&#10;&#10;4 x New &quot;Ringleader&quot; cards - Informants are a new ringleader (every player starts with one of each of the ringleaders) that add an element of bluff and deception to the game.&#10;&#10;With Informants in play, you can play any card face down and take the Informant action.  Any other player may challenge the Informant. When challenged, the active player reveals the card that was played. If that card is the Informant, the challenger must give the active player 2M ISK. If that card is not the Informant, no payments are due from any player to the active player, the challenger steals 2M ISK from the active player and gets to take the action on the card that was played.&#10;&#10;Informants are a really fun addition to the game and totally fitting with the Dystopian Universe.&#10;&#10;A set of these promo specialist cards.&#10;&#10;You are Awesome - Bonus #1: 3 x The Security Specialist promo&#10;You are Awesome - Bonus #2: 3 x Crooked Warden promo&#10;You are Awesome - Bonus #3: 3 x Veteran promo&#10;You are Awesome - Bonus #4: 3 x Underboss promo&#10;You are Awesome - Bonus #5: 3 x Negotiator promo&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Dark Ages is a historically-based civilization-building game that features an innovative action selection mechanism. As long as your action markers remain on the board, you may be able to gain secondary bonus actions whenever you or another player repeat the action.&#10;&#10;While Dark Ages features objectives commonly found in 4X games &mdash; encouraging you to explore nearby regions, expand your territory, exploit the resources, and exterminate your opponents &mdash; it does so featuring several Euro-centric mechanisms. Collect resources from lands under your control, using them to build up your cities and fortifications. Some building types provide several ways for you to gain important in-game advantages, while others enhance your military strength or simply score you victory points. As you expand your territory, you will lay claim to noble titles, acquire new technologies, and train your military units. Each region and leader offer asymmetrical choices with their unique abilities.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;Dark Ages: Holy Roman Empire has the same core mechanisms as Dark Ages: Heritage of Charlemagne, but it focuses on Central Europe. As a result, it has a different game board. In addition, the card mixes are different, with different unique Culture Cards for the rulers, technologies and units. Furthermore, Heritage of Charlemagne contains a set of Vassals, which are missing from Holy Roman Empire. Instead, this version has a set of Relics.&#10;&#10;The two sets also differ in micro-expansions (&quot;modules&quot;) that are included. Holy Roman Empire contains the Crusades and The Pope modules.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "7 Ages is a game of world history from 4000 BC/E to 2000 AD/CE. Players represent dynasties that decide the fate of the world across the millennia.&#10;&#10;You, as a dynastic head of one or more empires must guide your empires through history gaining glory points for historical, scientific, religious and cultural advances as you increase their health, wealth and prestige. All the leading figures of history are included, as they attempt to influence events and their society through their great words and deeds.&#10;&#10;Players can play multiple civilizations simultaneously (though the counter set limits the total number of civilizations that can be in play), but the first civilization card played determines the time frame in which the game starts, restricting which additional civilizations may actually be played and/or what historical leaders civilizations in play may use. This makes the secret bids to get the first move important to all players.&#10;&#10;The game features playing cards that represent either a historical civilization, an action, or a civilization advance, depending on the context in which the card is played. Each card also has a numeric value, used for making bids and trading. The game also features a system of a limited number of action options per player based on chits secretly selected by players each turn -- for example, if you are playing more than one civilization, only one can declare war, only one can take production, etc. There is a &quot;wild&quot; chit each player can use to let two of his or her civilizations take the same action, but the civilization using the wild chit pays a penalty.&#10;&#10;Victory points and civilization levels are plotted using an on-board scoring area. Game play can be quite long with more than two or three players, so most games end at a predetermined time or turn with the player with the most victory points from all his or her civilizations combined winning.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Background:&#10;&#10;Long hampered by cost and beset by international problems, real space exploration did not seem possible for humanity. Amazing technological breakthroughs would change all of that in the year 2112. The invention of the Near Faster Than Light (NFTL) drive would make it possible for large ships to move easily in and out of a planet's gravity well, and to travel quickly within the confines of a solar system. Ten years later, the perfecting of Faster Than Light (FTL) drive would turn the galaxy into an open canvas. United by a common purpose, the newly formed Terran Confederation began to paint their picture. &#10;&#10;Expansion led to colonies, research stations, and even more technological discoveries, but it also led to the realization that they were not alone. Although no sentient alien species had been encountered, long range scanners had picked up the distinctive signatures of FTL drives. Sentient races must exist... and they must be space faring. Terran expansion stopped. &#10;&#10;Not knowing what to expect, a period of consolidation followed which emphasized defensive technologies and fleet building. First contact was made by the people of Earth with this unknown race in 2227. Over time, they would eventually call these other-worlders the Talon. It was a shortening of the alien sounds that made up their name but it was also oddly prophetic-the Talon Empire swooped in very much like a raptor upon the fledgling Terran Confederation.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;&#10;Units:  Individual capital ships and fighters&#10;&#10;Time:  Individual fleet battles&#10;&#10;Players:  2 to 6&#10;&#10;Map:  Each hex represents a region of space that normally holds only one ship&#10;&#10;Solitaire Suitability: there is no hidden information and no simultaneous action&#10;&#10;Welcome to the Talonverse.....&#10;Talon is a game of tactical space combat set in a growing universe with its own history and back story.  This game introduces battles during the First Talon War between the Terran Confederation and the Talon Empire.&#10;&#10;This is a Fleet Combat game.  Battles with individual ships can be fought, but the game easily and quickly simulates combat with fleets of 3-10 ships. These are fleets of Capital Ships.  This is NOT a game about fighter combat in space.  Most ships in the game are large and you must balance your ships' power output between shields, weapons, sensors and maneuverability - you are not just doing an Immelman.  Each faction has unique abilities and each ship has unique features.  Proper strategy involves assessing the different abilities of your ships and the enemy's.&#10;&#10;This is an Accessible game.  The complexity of managing fleets of capital ships has been baked into the game system, leaving the player free to make interesting decisions.  It is also a Fast Paced game.  Small fleet scenarios can be played in one hour, larger ones in under two.  This makes the game thematically rich and full of quick but meaningful choices.&#10;&#10;How can the game do all this?  All a ship's energy use is integrated into something called a Power Curve.  All a player has to do is adjust the speed of the ship.  A ship's speed determines how much Available Power it gets to charge weapons faster, reinforce shields, tighten turns... but there will never be enough of it.  The game is fought on a Map - distances moved, firing arcs, shield arcs are distinct and easily resolved.  The game uses Very Large, Laminated Counters.   All of a ship's systems are displayed directly on the counter and lamination allows you to mark damage and other ship info with a dry erase marker.  All of the important information is at your fingertips, at-a-glance, on the map. Being able to see the battle unfold on map allows the game system to handle a much larger number of ships without confusion and effort.&#10;&#10;Game Features&#10;&#10;     Terran Fleet (10 different ship classes)&#10;     Talon Fleet (9 different ship classes)&#10;     Ships with 4 Shield Arcs&#10;     Fighter Squadrons&#10;     Bases, Transports&#10;     Unique Abilities for each faction&#10;     Asteroids, Planets, Nebulae&#10;     Black Holes, Worm Holes&#10;     6 Different Weapon Systems including Missiles that track on the board&#10;     NFTL and FTL Drives&#10;     12 Scenarios following the story of the First Talon War&#10;     Mission Variety: Escort missions, planetary invasions, base assaults...&#10;     Lifetime Score tracking &#10;     Empire War campaign game with dynamic, strategic-level decisions&#10;     Point System for Purchasing Ships and Design-Your-Own Scenarios&#10;     A tie in with Space Empires 4x&#10;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Update:From the GMT Talon Reprint page: &quot;Solitaire: - The Talon system plays extremely well solitaire for two reasons:&#10;&#10;1. There is no hidden information.&#10;&#10;2. There are no simultaneous decisions. Each decision happens sequentially.&#10;&#10;However, a dedicated Solitaire System is being released with Talon 1000.

    "description": "For Glory is a game of gladiatorial combat and deck building for 2 players. Players take on the role of gladiator school owners, or lanistas, in ancient Rome. The game utilizes a two-phase system for deck building and combat. During the Machinations Phase, players recruit gladiators, secure the support of influential patrons, increase their income, and train their gladiators in a multitude of tactics. When the crowd&rsquo;s bloodlust becomes insatiable, the game shifts to the Arena Phase, during which players control their gladiators in various arenas to battle their opponents&rsquo; gladiators for glory. Each gladiator has a unique set of stats and a unique ability. Having the right synergies between gladiators often means the difference between death and glory. During arena battles, players also play tactic and reaction cards from their hand to support their gladiators, or turn the tides of battle. The first player to gain six glory by winning arena battles is the victor, and will be remembered for all time as the greatest lanista of Rome.&#10;&#10;",

The 4, 6, 8, 12 and 20 sided dice are capricious, so try to anticipate on chances!&#10;&#10;",
