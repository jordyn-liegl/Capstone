    "description": "When the day gives way to the night, Mother Nature stages one of the greatest shows that man has ever witnessed. The night sky shimmers with a myriad of bright gleams: the stars. For centuries we studied their movements and tried to organize them into what we commonly call &ldquo;constellations&rdquo;. Evocative names for patterns in the sky that resemble objects, fantastical creatures, animals or ancient gods. Will you be able to locate your constellation and trace it in A Sky of Stars?&#10;&#10;Game Objective&#10;A Sky of Stars is a game that will engage players' imagination and their ability for abstract thought. Each player will link up the stars suggested by the Star Die, drawing the pattern of new constellations on his or her personal Sky. Each creation will then be reviewed by the other players, who will have to find out what object is represented in each Sky. The player that creates the best patterns and is able to interpret those of the other players is going to win the game.&#10;&#10;A Sky of Stars is a original roll-and-write game, with a funny guess-mechanism. Try to design your best constellation while all other players try to figure out what it is!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

This was a good thing, for you drew solar power from the ten suns, making you invincible.&#10;&#10;Alas, a mortal hero called Hou Yi appeared and began shooting the Suns down one by one with his golden bow. With the demise of each Sun, your power fades. You realize your seat of absolute power is at risk.

Players are Primordials who draw their energy from the 10 Suns. Before the Suns all disappear, players rush to gain enough prestige to secure a permanent position among the Gods. The game features famous locations in China like the Great Wall, Xi An, and many others. It also features other Gods and legends of ancient China, including Chang'E and the Jade Rabbit.&#10;&#10;At the start of every turn players have a specific amount of energy to bid with, towards an ever-changing pool of cards known as the Mortal Plane. This amount is equal to the current number of Suns in the sky. However each time Hou Yi appears, more Suns will be shot down and players will have lesser and lesser energy to bid with. Players can tap on other forms of energy, such as Lunar energy from the moon, or other Gods - basically engine building.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Some even say the town has an &ldquo;other side&rdquo; where the crazy roams unchecked, but I can&rsquo;t speak much to that.&#10;&#10;By the 1980s, things had gotten especially weird--at least until a bunch of kids started snooping around trying to get to the bottom of the town&rsquo;s supernatural goings-on. While the adults were worried about their Tupperware parties, these youngsters were out tracking down clues and finding trouble before it found them. And rumor has it they found some kind of creature in the woods too which might explain all them FBI fellers around here asking questions.&#10;&#10;And here they come now, riding around town on their bicycles. I just hope they figure things out soon. Looks like some kind of dark cloud is rolling in right behind them.&#10;&#10;Overview:&#10;Take on the role of a group of kids and their newfound alien friend, and explore Wode Ridge looking for evidence of the town&rsquo;s supernatural happenings. But be wary, the Darkness knows you&rsquo;re on to it, so it&rsquo;ll be trying to get you before you get it. Find enough evidence to figure out what monster is currently ailing the town and then defeat it before time runs out and the Darkness overtakes you.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The difficulty of the game adds to its play and replay value.&#10;&#10;Phase Line Smash handles a number of aspects of the Gulf War in a realistic and sensitive manner. Fratricide is one such issue that is included in the game mechanics and discussed in the historical notes included with the game.&#10;&#10;The game box is rather heavy because of the historical notes included with the game.

It depicts James Graham, the Marquis of Montrose, and his legendary string of victories over the Scottish Covenanter government during the First English Civil War (1642-1646), that would later go down in a crushing defeat. The Royalist player must recruit a Highland army and either replicate Montrose&rsquo;s victories or march into England. The Covenanter player must overcome factional infighting to defeat Montrose. Both sides must manage the tendency of conscripted units to disband after every defeat or victory.&#10;The game uses a modification of the Hand of Destiny series rules. Each player has a unique set of campaign cards generating historical events such as defection, plague, and the terrifying Highland charge, all of which affect recruitment, movement, and combat. Combat is resolved using a quasi-tactical procedure in which units take turns attacking one another.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

This one takes its cue from the post WW2 oddness of Tomorrow the World, where the Germans and Japanese win the war and conquer the entire planet.&#10;&#10;MB is set in that alternate 1948 when the two powers square off against each other in the heartland of the former USA. The Germans move north from St. Louis while the Japanese move in from western Missouri and Iowa. MB's map has hexes 12 kilometers across, and counters represent 8,000 to 15,000 men, or 180 to 300 vehicles. It may not be to everyone's taste because of the alt-history premise of the game.&#10;&#10;",

Two maps cover Europe and North Africa from Caucasus to Ireland and from Sweden to Egypt. 780 counters personify land and naval units as well as every corps-commanding leader of that time. The combat units are army corps and fleets, and sometimes entire armies. Their content varies with the player&rsquo;s will and the contingencies of that era; Guard, line infantry, Elite, light cavalry, heavy cavalry, militia, Cossacks, and so on. The game turns are season-based and interactive, including a variable number of impulses. A budget phase occurs every fall.&#10;&#10;The game can involve two players (one French and one anti-French), or five players (France, Great-Britain, Prussia, Russia and Austria), or even seven players (Spain and the Ottoman Empire have their own player). Of course, victory conditions vary accordingly.&#10;&#10;The operational part of the game points out the importance of leadership and line of communication; attrition can be very high. Evasive actions and interceptions lead to the deployment of armies followed by battle. Battle occurs in the same hex; troop quality, tactical choices and leader values are taken into account in the issue of the battle.&#10;&#10;At the strategic level, the players are responsible for their unit&rsquo;s production and maintenance. Diplomacy is the key point in creating alliances with other powers, major or minor. Moreover, many random events improve the Napoleonic flavor of that time.&#10;&#10;The overall purpose of the Grand Empire is to provide a strategic Napoleonic game that takes into account historical, military and diplomatic sights, and that can be played in a short period of time (one year is four turns and can be played in two hours) with a reasonable amount of rules.&#10;&#10;Contents :&#10; * Two maps&#10; * 3 countersheets (260 double sided counters each).&#10; * one rulebook and one scenarios booklet.&#10; * 2 dice.&#10; * Tables and charts&#10;&#10;",

With two players, one takes on the role of General Robert E. Lee, commander of the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia, while the other player assumes the role of General George C.

There are six scenarios, including a campaign scenario that simulates all three days of the battle.  The publisher suggests that the four-turn &quot;Assault on the Round Tops&quot; scenario be played first in order to become familiar with the game turn sequence and the line-of-sight rules.  Depending on the scenario selected, playing time is between 2 and 18 hours.  &#10;&#10;&#10;",

Rules editor and TableTop Simulator module by Rolf Grein.&#10;&#10;HISTORICAL BACKGROUND&#10;&#10;After months of stalemate on the Western Front, the British and French decided they would open a second front by attacking Germany&rsquo;s ally &ndash; the Ottoman Empire. In March 1915 they sent a fleet of battleships through the Dardanelles in an effort to reach the Turkish capitol, Constantinople, and force the Ottoman government to surrender.&#10;&#10;However, the Dardanelles were well defended by forts and sea mines and the Allied fleet suffered heavy losses. The naval campaign was abandoned until the forts could be captured by amphibious assault.&#10;&#10;The game focuses on the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) sector of the campaign; thus, it does not cover the British and French landings at Cape Helles or Suvla Bay.&#10;&#10;The board presents one of the narrowest sections of the Gallipoli Peninsula, from ANZAC Cove to Mal Tepe and Khetia Bay. The ANZAC goal was to capture this area and cut off the Turkish forces fighting the British and French at Cape Helles further south.&#10;&#10;The heights of Chunuk Bair and Mal Tepe were considered especially important because they provided observation of both sides of the Peninsula. From here the ANZACs could capture the forts which dominated the Narrows and thus allow the battleships of the Royal Navy to sail up to Constantinople. At least that is what was supposed to happen.&#10;&#10;In fact, the British commanders had seriously under-estimated the Turkish resistance. The Turkish soldiers were veterans of the Balkan Wars, armed with modern, German-made rifles and artillery. Inspired by the leadership of Colonel Kemal and Lieutenant Colonel Sefik, they stopped the ANZACs in their tracks. The ANZACs only managed to establish a small beachhead, which was repeatedly counterattacked by the Turks.&#10;&#10;In August 1915, the British and ANZACs made another attempt to seize the ridges of Sari Bair. The New Zealanders and Gurkhas managed to capture the heights for two days but were eventually overwhelmed by Turkish counterattacks. In December, after eight months of fighting, the ANZAC forces were evacuated.&#10;&#10;In the words of Australian war correspondent, Charles Bean: &ldquo;ANZAC stands for reckless valour in a good cause, for enterprise, resourcefulness, fidelity, comradeship and endurance that will never admit defeat.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;So what went wrong?&#10;&#10;To quote the 'Gallipoli 1915' Facebook page: &quot;At Gallipoli, inexperienced troops, led by untested commanders, supported by staffs that had yet to learn their jobs were sent with wholly inadequate artillery, ammunition and logistical support to perform one of the most challenging operations of war: an opposed landing on an enemy shore. Add in the nature of the terrain and we can begin to understand how it was that 4,000 Australians landing that early morning of 25th April 1915 were held up by a force that, initially, numbered only around 80 Turks.&quot;&#10;&#10;Lest we forget.&#10;&#10;",

On a turn, a player moves one Boomer in a straight line on the game board grid, moving it as many spaces as they wish. After this, he may use this Boomer and one of the opponent's Boomers to place cornerstones on the game board; these cornerstones are placed on the intersections where these two Boomers would meet, should they move toward one another. (If one of the Boomers couldn't reach an intersection point due to another piece being in the way, that cornerstone is not placed.)&#10;&#10;Chains of cornerstones form borders on the game board, and at some point these borders will close off certain areas from the rest of the game board. If Boomers of only one color are in an area, this area/homestead belongs to the owner of those Boomers.&#10;&#10;The game ends once all Boomers have their own homestead.

    "description": "&quot;Revolution Road&quot; presents the first two conflicts between Britain and her American colonials in 1775 which ignited the American Revolutionary War. Two complete games are included, BOSTON TO CONCORD and BUNKER HILL. These are fast, tense battles. Card driven, area movement, low counter density, quick play and simple to learn, all make REVOLUTION ROAD a wonderful introduction to the American Revolution and to war-gaming. Its wealth of historical information makes it an ideal teaching tool.&#10;&#10;Although the scale between the games is decidedly different the same rules apply with only slight differences. BOSTON TO CONCORD is a game of maneuver, very chess-like. For the Patriot player it involves alarming the countryside with night-riders, mustering militia and trying to fend off the best infantry in the world. For the British it is playing hide and seek with Patriot Arms caches as he ferrets out Sons of Liberty troublemakers and then tries to make it back to waiting reinforcements as the Patriot forces grow to unmanageable size.&#10;&#10;Bunker Hill is a different animal altogether, a basic slug-fest. The Patriot player faces a growing tide of redcoats who threaten to overwhelm his defense works on every turn. Patriots face disappearing ammunition, flanking, panic and optional rules for alternate British landing sites. As casualties mount historic leaders try desperately to rally their men and bring about the miraculous result reflected upon by British General Henry Clinton when he declared &quot;It was a dear-bought victory; another such would have ruined us.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

Your gnomes come alive at midnight but have to stay hidden out of the shifting moonlight.&#10;&#10;3 ways to win: Capture the three toadstools, Bump 3 rival gnomes off the board, or Complete the dance design anywhere on the board.&#10;&#10;Gnomes can move 1 space in any direction, but they may never move on or off of a moonlit square, as shown on your current moonlight card. If a gnome moves onto a rival gnome, the rival is bumped off the board.&#10;&#10;On your turn you may move, or add a gnome back onto a start garden square. Then reveal your next moonlight card. A player only has to complete 1 of the 3 goals to win.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;Be sneaky or bold, but only one group of gnomes will win the lawn for the night.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Capture the winning pieces by causing eruptions!&#10;&#10;Using the same erupt-and-capture mechanism as Volcano, Caldera changes just about everything else.  The following play summary requires no prior knowledge of Volcano, but does assume a basic knowledge of Looney Pyramids.&#10;&#10;Using 6 rainbow stashes, four of the colors in each stash are set up on a Volcano board in nests.  Since there are only 24 nests, the center of the board is left empty.  The 5th color of each stash is used for caps (generally black, the opaque color).  The players move caps to cause eruptions to capture pieces, but also have the option each turn to execute a Power Play: return a previously captured piece to the board.  The game ends when one player has captured 3 monochrome trios--that player wins.&#10;&#10;Although Caldera originated as a variant of Volcano, its &quot;Fiesta Caldera&quot; variant is now the canonical version of Volcano.&#10;&#10;",

Players take the roles of the great commanders of history, including Xerxes, Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar, Saladin, and William Wallace.&#10;&#10;The game system is straight-forward and action-packed, as players depend upon the quality of their army&rsquo;s leadership to provide activation points allowing them to maneuver their armies and strike against the enemy. The better an army&rsquo;s command, the more flexibility it has to move, rally, and attack.&#10;&#10;Also included are supplementary rules that cover free deployment in scenarios, barbarian charges, command control and impetuousity, elephant panic, and random events.&#10;&#10;Each of the twenty included scenarios indicate the disposition of each army that engaged at that historical battle. Units include a variety of infantry types (including hoplites and the Macedonian phalanx), cavalry (including chariots and mounted archers), missile units (including slingers, longbows, and even early gunpowder weapons), and special units such as elephants and war wagons.&#10;&#10;The game&rsquo;s primary engine is comprised of an action deck used to determine command, the randomly determined outcomes of actions, and melee combat. Additionally, action cards provide special effects that players can use to enhance their units&rsquo; abilities as well as the narrative of the gaming experience. The action deck provides a unique means of resolving a battle in an experience that will never be duplicated.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

These include mandatory offensives and the loss of Soviet momentum, Stavka reserves, German Superiority rules that ebb away with Soviet victories, and the counterbalance of Von Manstein in securing German reinforcements against the wilder impulses of the Fuhrer.&#10;&#10;The game has many characteristics similar to other hex and counter wargames, but it also has notable differences such as the highly variable effects of weather, the absence of zones of control when moving, and the importance of nearby HQs for keeping units in supply. Combat is very punishing for both sides, reflecting the terrible attrition witnessed during the battles of this campaign. It rewards careful positioning to take advantage of breakthroughs, and the use of support counters at the right time.&#10;&#10;The full campaign will take several hours to complete, but the shorter scenarios can be played in an evening. The game is also very suitable for solo play and online play using Vassal.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "From the rules: &quot;For decades, reporters from around the world have been on the hunt for the Loch Ness monster.  But lately reports of sightings of Nessie have been increasing.&#10;&#10;&quot;Such reports naturally have drawn such reporters as the attractive Belinda Viewing from New York, the half-Belgian Claude McMirror, the clever Filosa Sharp, as well as her Londoner competitor Jack Nesstee, and even Nils the Blitzen from Denmark to the Loch.  Equipped with the most modern equipment and techniques, these daring reporters have traveled to Scotland, in order to capture the elusive Nessie on film for their newspapers.&#10;&#10;&quot;But the 5 will experience some surprises . . .&quot;&#10;&#10;In Loch Ness, players compete to get pictures of Nessie.  In turn order, players place or move their photographers on the board as they try to anticipate the movement of the Loch Ness monster.  The movement of the monster is determined randomly by drawing move cards from the first three players, each card having a number from 1 to 5.  The cards are not revealed until after the photographers have been placed.  When they are revealed, the monster moves the total number of spaces and players score points based on the value of their photographers placed in the area where Nessie emerged.  In addition, the players whose photographers were directly in front of Nessie select photo cards that will award points at the end of the game, especially if sets are created.&#10;&#10;Beginning in the second round, players will select an action space each round that gives them a unique power to use for for the round.  Placement also gets more challenging from the second round onward as a player is required to move a photographer, perhaps opening up spots for opponents.  Each round, some of the players do have a limited knowledge of how Nessie will move each round.  When a player draws a movement card before positioning his photographers, he is allowed to look at it, giving him one-third of the movement for that round.  However, movement varies tremendously and only three players draw movement cards each round.&#10;&#10;The game ends after the round in which a mini Nessie figure reaches space 65 on the score track.  This figure moves the same number of spaces as the main Nessie figure in the game board each round.  The player with the most points, scored during the game and from the photo cards at the end, wins the game.  The rules include two optional variants that can be added individually or together with the base game.&#10;&#10;Not to be confused with the 2010 Walter Obert game with the same theme, Loch Ness.&#10;&#10;",

Sid Sackson included it in A Gamut of Games.&#10;&#10;Le Truc is a betting/bluffing/trick-taking game for two players or two teams of two players. It is played in rounds of 12 points and the first side to take two rounds wins. For each hand, players are dealt three cards from a French 32-card deck. A hand is initially worth one point, but the active player may propose a raise in stakes before answering each trick. A hand is won by taking the majority of tricks or by making the opponent(s) fold to a raise. Only ranks of cards are important in Le Truc, not suits. If two cards of the same rank are played in a trick it is &quot;spoiled&quot; and not counted for either side. The first trick of a hand is particularly important, because it acts as a tiebreaker when both sides win an equal number of tricks.&#10;&#10;There is a Brazilian variant know as Truco that also includes a card value to have higher in-game value than others. This value changes at each trick by drawing a card.&#10;&#10;",

If you completely surround an opponent's tower, you can remove the top level of that tower from the board.&#10;&#10;In addition to building three complete towers, a player can also win by eliminating all of the opponent's workers from the game board.&#10;&#10;",

In medieval England times are hard, and to feed your family you will be forced to trek into the countryside, where you hope to slay the mysterious beasts that seem to be plaguing the tiny town of Hamlet. You have heard tales of the wretched creatures regurgitated from the Hamletsmaw, and though travellers shout of their horror, they also whisper through drink-numbed lips of the treasures that may be found within their guts.&#10;&#10;The aim of the game is simple; be the player with the most loot once every player is dead. The journey there is not such a simple one though.&#10;&#10;Each round of gameplay consists of a day and night phase. Creatures are drawn from a deck and placed in a grid at the centre of the table, where during the day players will choose which to face. Many things will affect the outcome of this combat, such as ammunition type equipped, creature health, defence, and number of attacks, and player health and items. Combat is resolved through dice rolls, and if the player survives they may receive a loot reward. These rewards can be sold for gold, crafted into better items that will be worth more in the future, or eaten to stave off death.&#10;&#10;While players have control during the day, once the sun sets and night settles across the land, the creatures in play will follow them back to camp, setting upon the doomed adventurers. No loot can be won during the chaos of night, leaving survival the only reward to a successful defence.&#10;&#10;At the same time, all players are competing to become the richest hero, so back-stabbing, betrayal, theft, and murder will be in abundance. The most important thing to remember is that death is inevitable, so take joy in your friend's suffering, and race to meet them on the other side!&#10;&#10;",

Each player comes up with a story about how they'll solve the situation using exactly three of the five objects in their hand, and then everyone takes a turn pitching their story to a judge. A winning story is selected, a new player becomes the judge, and the next round begins.&#10;&#10;",
