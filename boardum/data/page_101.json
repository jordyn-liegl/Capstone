    "description": "In 1688, Louis XIV embarked upon a war of aggression later called the Nine Year's War or the WAR OF THE GRAND ALLIANCE. At the same time, supported by influential British political and religious leaders, Wiliam III Prince of Orange crossed the Channel to invade England, deposing the English King James II, his father-in-law, in the &quot;Glorious Revolution.&quot;&#10;&#10;Nine Years: The War of the Grand Alliance is a stand alone game using the No Peace Without Spain system. In addition to the Grand Alliance scenario (from 1688-1699), players owning both this game and No Peace Without Spain can play the epic Grand Campaign scenario running from 1688 to 1713. Now players can recreate one of the decisive moments in European history, as France begins its long slide to revolution, Austria enjoys its last moment of continental dominance and Britain asserts itself as the preeminent power of Europe.&#10;&#10;",

The players collect feathers on the beach to decorate the masks as beautifully as possible. In the end, the most colorful masks are worth the most points.&#10;&#10;The players play colored or black cards to the five masks. They don't know which mask belongs to whom, but they are trying to deduce that information. If they guess correctly, they receive bonus points. If the owner of a mask is correctly guessed by everyone, then that player loses.&#10;&#10;In turn, the active player reveals a card from the deck and places it above or below a mask. As soon as a mask has five feather cards, points are awarded. However, only at the end of the round will the owners of these points (and the masks) be identified. The game lasts for three rounds, so if you don't score in a round, you will get two additional chances.&#10;&#10;The elements water, fire, and air influence the party. Sometimes the sea brings additional feathers, while the wind in combination with a campfire could burn a feather.&#10;&#10;Decorate the masks on the island, mask yourself, and press your luck!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

You'll need to find defense somehow, though, as you don't have enough seals to last the entire night...&#10;&#10;In Verflucht!

If it shows an item, they take the card on the hand without revealing its value. If the drawn card is a creature, they must place the card face up in the display. The player now has the chance to expel one of the red creatures with one (or more) green cards, and the collective value &#226;&#128;&#139;&#226;&#128;&#139;of the items played must be at least as high as the value of the creature.

    "description": "String Railway: Transport is a follow-up game to String Railway, a train game in which the play area is created by placing varying lengths of colored string representing different types of terrain. The board is initially seeded with all the stations (unlike in String Railway) placed randomly inside the boundary string and filled with two goods cubes.&#10;&#10;Each turn, players must place one string that connects stations. Then players have a number of action points to use. Players start with a 3 AP locomotive, and can upgrade to better locomotives that provide up to 6 AP per turn. Action points are used to moving goods cubes (1 AP to move from station to station). If a cube reaches a station of the same colour as the cube itself, the cube is then scored.&#10;&#10;White cubes are special long distance cubes. Players have mission cards that show three stations in particular order. In order to fulfill the mission, the player must move a long-distance cube through the stations in right order. The reward depends on how many stations player moves the cube through. Unfulfilled mission is worth -2. Moving the cube through one station gets rid of the penalty. Two stations gets rid of the penalty and gives the player the white cube, which is scored as a wild cube. Three stations scores 5 points on top of that.&#10;&#10;After five rounds, the cubes are scored. Each set of five cubes of different colours is worth 15 points, 4-cube sets are 10 points, 3-cube sets are 6 points, 2-cube sets are 3 points and remaining single cube sets give 1 point each. White wild cubes can be very useful at this point. Unfulfilled missions are -2 points, while perfectly fulfilled missions are +5 points.&#10;&#10;In addition of moving cubes, action points can be used for upgrading locomotives and replenishing goods cubes. Collected goods cubes can be discarded to gain AP. Players can also draw new mission cards and each player has a personal station they can place on board at some point in game.&#10;&#10;String Railway: Transport, with a playing time of approx. 15 minutes per player, differs from the original game by adding cargo delivery and removing the values of stations. Transport is an individual game, not an expansion. The games are not compatible: you can't play String Railway with the components of Transport (the stations are different and there's no river).&#10;&#10;",

American Carrom can also be played with a cue, and the board is patterned with checkers, chess or other board motifs, allowing a variety of other games to be played.  Many American Carrom boards also double as Crokinole boards.&#10;&#10;In American Carrom the object is to flick to strike the Carrom men into the pockets in a similar fashion to pool or billiards.  Sometimes a cue is used rather than flicking.  Due to the larger pocket size American Carrom lacks some of the strategy and skill required of the 'proper' version of the game.&#10;&#10;Also noteworthy is the fact that American Carrom uses rings for game pieces whereas Carrom game pieces are solid discs.&#10;&#10;European games in a similar vein: Korona and H-ring spel.&#10;&#10;",

Additionally, don't let tiles placed by your opponents cut you off, or else you'll be forced to lose valuable time. When all of the 120 coins are collected, the game ends, and whoever has collected the most coins wins.&#10;&#10;",

You control the various Marine squads, each with a specialized skill, as they fight their way through an alien enemy that is totally unpredictable. The Kay&rsquo;otz come from another dimension of space and do not behave in a way humans can comprehend. Only with perseverance and skillful strategy &ndash; and yes, some good fortune &ndash; will you be able to eventually discover the plans and tactics of these mysterious beings.&#10;&#10;Invaders from Dimension X! is an easy game to play and is suitable for players 12 years old and up.  There are two Battle scenarios and one Campaign scenario included in the game and each can be completed in about an hour or two (depending on the scenario played). This game package contains one map sheet (with two separate maps printed front and back), eighty-eight counters and one 8-page rule book. You will need to provide some six-sided dice to play the game &ndash; along with enough backbone, brains and wits to defeat this vile alien enemy.&#10;&#10;",

The players must cooperate as they face the challenges of their world, including the formidable shadows that are the minions of Darkness. Eventually, they must choose the bravest among them to enter the mouth of Darkness and rescue the sun.&#10;&#10;Each round of the game (known as a &quot;day&quot;) is divided into three phases: the Dawn phase, the Challenge phase, and the Dusk phase. In the Dawn phase, each player uses their actions to move about, purify corruption, scout challenges, and share items. In the Challenge phase, each player undertakes a challenge. If they succeed, they gain rewards; if they fail, they incur penalties. In the Dusk phase, game upkeep is performed.&#10;&#10;In order to win the game, the players must choose one warrior to enter Darkness as their champion. While the champion battles inside Darkness and attempts to reach the swallowed sun, the other warriors must still defend Tallil from the encroaching shadows, lest they corrupt the world and plunge everything into eternal night. If Darkness finishes swallowing the sun, or the shadows gain too much influence in the world, then the players lose the game.&#10;&#10;",

The designer has added new pieces and scenarios to this edition of the game.&#10;&#10;This 2-player game recreates General Patton's attempt to seize the key city of Metz and to get across the Moselle River before the retreating Germans can form an effective defense.  The U.S. forces comprised of three divisions of the 20th Corps had just completed an epic pursuit across France after the Allied breakout from the Normandy beachhead.  The exhausted Allied forces were at the end of their supply line and has barely enough resources left for one last push. If they had been able to get across the Moselle River, they would have compromised the entire German Westwall defenses. This would have enabled Patton to make an attempt at crossing the Rhine before the end of 1944 and might have ended the war months earlier.  The defending German forces, four divisions of the 82nd Corps of the German 1st Army, were a combination of hastily collected and organized units, including fresh units from the German interior and remnants of units that Patton had been pursuing across France. The battle, which began on 7 September 1944 and lasted for about a week, was a singular opportunity that could have gone either way. Historically, the Germans won, but just barely.&#10;&#10;Scale: Each unit is 1 regiment or brigade, each hex is 4 kilometers, and each turn is 1 day.&#10;&#10;Game Components:&#10;&bull; One 4-page, color instructions booklet&#10;&bull; 40 color, die-cut 5/8&rdquo; mounted game pieces&#10;&bull; One 11&rdquo; x 17&rdquo; color game map with tables&#10;&bull; One 4-page, color BATTLESSON (TM) booklet&#10;&bull; Game setup illustration, optional rules, and player&rsquo;s notes&#10;&#10;Reimplementation of:&#10;&#10;     The Drive on Metz&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The game takes many features from the earlier 1861: Railways of the Russian Empire, but adds some new features.&#10;&#10;The key new features are:&#10;a) There are no fixed positions for the minor companies, you choose a start position when you put up a minor for auction.&#10;b) The State Railway doesn't run its trains and save up for another, but rather just takes the next new train each round. This speeds up the game a little in comparison to 1861, and also accelerates the trains somewhat.&#10;&#10;This game was originally released as 1867: The Railways of Canada, but is now available as a complete stand-alone game.&#10;&#10;",

The sole hope for relief from a slow and painful death lies in the hands of the plague doctors. Dressed in black cloaks, and masks stuffed with vinegar-rags and spice, the surgeons roam the Burgus streets searching for the infected. To these they offer salvation, saving their flesh from death, while gaining prestige with the princely court and &mdash; why not? &mdash; one or two shiny coins!&#10;&#10;Will you prove yourselves as valorous surgeons, up to the tasks you're called to resolve? Will you expand your influence with good works, draining infected swamps and building plague hospitals? Or will you give in to the facts of life, and death, raking in whatever coins you happen to find?&#10;&#10;1347 is a strategic game in which players are plague doctors with the aim of gaining as much fame and prestige as possible to become the most important of the town. Each player has resource cards, money, grave diggers, and five influence tokens at their disposal to invest in order to defeat the plague and enrich themselves. There are three stages that will repeat for three periods (that will vary from 6 to 9 game rounds):&#10;&#10;&#10;     Investments -&gt; Each player, turn by turn, will invest one influence token (from 0-4 influence points) in one of the six areas of the board, each one with different actions allowed. All the investments are hidden. Investments go on until all players remain with no tokens.&#10;     Actions -&gt; Starting from Area 1, all invested tokens are revealed. The player who invested the most is the only one who can exploit the actions allowed from that area. The other players who invested can convert their &quot;unused points&quot; in money or grave diggers. So losing is also a strategy. In case of tie, the first player, or the nearest one in clockwise has priority, in any case the first player will change at the end of each round.&#10;     Upkeep -&gt; In this stage players collect money from the Agrus (the country), can heal their recruited plagued commoners, or can maintain their healed commoners. Healed commoners give players new influence tokens to invest and an ability to exploit as long as they remain healed.&#10;&#10;&#10;There are many kind of actions players can do: recruit commoners, transform grave diggers in peasants to collect money, build expansions to enforce their influence to specific areas, etc.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, the players obtain 1 wealth point (victory points) for:&#10;&#10;     Each influence point (the value shown on each influence token held);&#10;     Every five coins;&#10;     Each subject card;&#10;     Each development held;&#10;     Every three gravediggers held (including the player's reserve and those assigned to the Agrus).&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The amount of the influence corresponds to the number on the counter. Whoever controls all three of the buildings or controls eleven city districts has won the game.&#10;&#10;The game was later reprinted as Atlanteon, in which mighty undersea warriors fight to control the capital of the Sunken Kingdoms.

Not only does the game provide historical scenarios set in Iraq, Somalia, Afghanistan and Syria, but its mini-maps can be combined freely to build any kind of scenario a player wishes.&#10;&#10;WARFARE - Modern Tactical Combat is definitely easy to master. Its low complexity and density of counters on the map make it a fast game (on average 90 mins.), with a very high level of interaction.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

From meadows and forest edges, horses gallop towards it, birds flock to it, foxes run to it. Not even the man could resist this river. The man walked to it and stayed for centuries. The nature of Mezen amazed the man so much that he decided to commemorate it. He gathered soot, black as the night itself, and clay, red as the sun, picked up a brush and started creating. That is how the famous Mezen painting came about &mdash; the style upon which this game is based.&#10;&#10;In Mezen, you take on the role of a northern craftsman, creating intricate ornamental paintings to order. Combine symbols and flip tiles to accomplish goals and earn points.&#10;&#10;Each turn, players choose a group of adjacent identical symbols to remove from their &quot;painting&quot; and slide down the tiles above to fill the empty spots. After that, they flip the removed tiles to their opposite side &mdash; from white to black &mdash; and place them in the newly empty spots. By changing the placement of symbols this way, the players try to accomplish goals and score. Whoever has the most points after ten rounds wins.&#10;&#10;",

The players must also play fast because they are racing a real-world timer. If time expires, the Survivors are left behind and die.&#10;&#10;Players play cards during a common &quot;Survivor Turn&quot;. At the start of the Survivor Turn, all players can discard and draw until the number of cards in their hands is equal to their Hand Sizes. There are no player turns. Declare what you are doing, which card you are playing, and which zombie you are attacking, and roll dice. This simulates the chaos of combat. Most cards can be used to perform more than one function. You can perform as many actions during the Survivor Turn as your cards can support. You can even trade weapons and items with other Survivors in your Location.&#10;&#10;Once all players have resolved their actions, the Zombies get to attack.&#10;&#10;The game is co-opish... how you play the game is up to you. You don't gain anything by having other Survivors die, but if you spend too much time trying to help others, it might cost you your own survival.&#10;&#10;Help them? Leave them behind? It's all up to you.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "&quot;ROME, INC. - From Augustus to Diocletian&quot; is a solitaire wargame of the Roman Empire from Augustus in 27 BCE to Diocletian in 286 CE. The player (as CEO of this vast corporate empire), appoints consuls and governors, raises taxes, deploys legions, fleets and auxiliaries to garrison provinces, and fights wars to expand the prestige and power of Rome.&#10;&#10;Historical statesmen are rated for their military and administrative talents, popularity, and skill at intrigue (or lack thereof), and each has a special ability. Governors are used to fight wars, expand the empire, and develop provinces, but may make themselves Caesar through assassination or rebellion. New imperial dynasties change the rules of the game, provide new units, and determines who will succeed when Caesar dies.&#10;&#10;Each turn produces a new crisis and the player, much like a modern CEO, earns victory points by expanding the empire and triumphing over wars and rebels, deciding where allocate his resources (capital spending), raise new forces (hiring), undertaking prestige projects (public relations), pleasing the mob (&quot;the shareholders&quot;), or even setting aside a reserve for a rainy decade or two. Annexing the rich provinces of the east will increase taxes, but securing the northern frontier may be more important. Placing a popular, competent general in command may result in a triumph, but encourage rebellion. A more loyal, but less able man may be better, or for Caesar to risk himself on the field of battle himself.&#10;&#10;The map consists of provinces grouped into military commands such as Britannia and Syria, each commanded by a governor. Provinces may be controlled by barbarians, allies or insurgents, which can be conquered and developed into peaceful tax-payers. Beyond these are the homelands from where barbarian wars and enemy leaders pillage their way from province to province until defeated. There are four scenarios starting in 27 BCE, 70 CE, 138 CE and 222 CE, which may be combined into campaign games. Each turn represented 5-10 years, with 10 turns in each of the four scenarios.&#10;&#10;ROME, INC. is in issue #53 of ATO&#10;&#10;Complexity - Medium&#10;Playing time - From 3 to 4 hours&#10;How challenging is it solitaire? - Excellent&#10;&#10;--description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Players take on the role of biplane pilots and tail gunners dog fighting their way through the gray skies of Europe during the war to end all wars. The game is visually appealing and, like many miniatures games, it was easy to project myself into the scenario. The game is played using 1/72 miniature aircraft mounted on radio antennae with a clear acrylic hex base to hold the whole thing upright. The game board is an aerial view of a WWI battlefield marked off in large hexes.&#10;&#10;Pilots and gunners plot out three moves at a time. Each move the pilot chooses from one of eight maneuvers - straight ahead, straight ahead fast, left slip, right slip, right, left, hard right, stall, and Immelman. The slips allow the player to retain their current orientation but slide one hex to the right or left. Ahead fast allows the plane to move two hexes. Ahead, left, right, and hard right allow the plane to change orientation and move one hex in that new direction. An Immelman allows the plane to move forward one hex but completely reverse orientation. A stall allows the plane to stay in its current hex with the current orientation but runs the risk of throwing the plane into a spin. Planes can fly on one of five altitudes. Descent is always possible but planes can generally only ascend when moving forward and trying no wild acrobatics. After movement, pilots may fire on any plane unlucky enough to find itself in their path.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "The war raged across Germany from 1618 to 1630 with the Habsburg, Holy Roman Emperor retaining the upperhand. Then the tide of war changed when King Gustav Adolf of Sweden, the &quot;Lion of the North,&quot; revitalized the cause of the Protestant princes of Germany. Bankrolled by France, the Swedes pushed their advantage towards the Emperor's most valuable ally, Maximilian of Bavaria. Though Catholic, France sought to keep the power of the Habsburgs in check by financially supporting the Swedish King.&#10;&#10;From 1632 to 1648, Bavaria and the surrounding area became a crucial battlefront to knocking Bavaria out of the war. The Swedes enjoyed success until fate removed their King and their over-extended forces could not hold onto their gains. After the Swedes suffered a sharp defeat at N&ouml;rdlingen in 1634, France was forced to play a more active role or lose all she had paid for. A series of seesaw campaigns ensued as the French Arm&eacute;e d'Allemagne secured crossings of the Rhine and pushed the war back into the heart of Bavaria. The area became the proving ground of the greatest generals of the age - Turenne, Cond&eacute;, Mercy, de Werth. Neither side possessed a clear superiority of forces so it was a dangerous game of cat-and-mouse, march, counter-march, siege, and surprise attacks. After several years, a combined French-Swedish campaign finally broke the back of the Bavarians in 1646 and Maximilian made a separate peace. It did not last long; after a year he reluctantly rejoined the Imperial cause. Repeating the winning combination of 1646, the French-Swedish army ended Maximilian's enterprise at Zusmarshausen in 1648.&#10;&#10;Won by the Sword is the first game in Ben Hull's Great Campaigns of the Thirty Years War series. It is a two-player game of operational warfare in the 17th Century. Armies maneuver on a point to point map of Southern Germany based on the road network available at the time. Each game is centered around a major battle or full campaign season. A Turn is a month divided into a variable number of impulses. Each army has a hand of Campaign Cards that control the amount of activity it may perform, the supplies it must expend, and a special action. Each impulse features one card play per army. Forces are concealed off map so players are faced with limited knowledge of the enemy. The major activities are maneuver, foraging, besieging fortifications, and an occasional battle. Won by the Sword is a low-complexity game with emphasis on the players maneuvering their forces, but many decisions await. The low rules complexity allows each player, rather than being encumbered with rules, to focus on choices regarding how to manage his campaign.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "The battle of Gettysburg was a huge struggle that locked armies of the North and South in three July days of bitter warfare which turned the tide of the Civil War against the Confederacy. Among the many small actions that made up this battle none was more important than the fight for Little Round Top, a rocky forested hill on which rested the extreme left flank of the Union line. It was here that the outnumbered 20th Maine regiment held off repeated Confederate assaults, turning back the South's best chance to win this battle which they could not afford to lose.&#10;&#10;Little Round Top is Avalon Hill's new game for two players which re-creates this critical battle. During a typical game turn, both players move their company sized forces over a map of the battle area, positioning them for rifle fire and bayonet charges. Fire and melee combat are resolved by a die roll on the appropriate Combat Results Table. Regimental officers and their command abilities are crucial for keeping the attack moving forward or the defense intact.&#10;&#10;Little Round Top comes complete with a colorful map of the battlefield, 100 cardboard playing pieces, and a short rules booklet.&#10;&#10;Playing time: 2 1/2 hours&#10;&#10;Complexity rating (from 1-10, 10 the highest): 4&#10;&#10;",

Use your characters' unique abilities to gain points and achieve victory!&#10;&#10;Each turn, you select one of your characters and perform two actions. Each character has access to basic actions like moving and challenges as well as several unique abilities that may be performed only by spending ability tokens. Funkoverse uses an innovative &quot;cooldown&quot; system &mdash; the more powerful the ability, the longer it will take for the ability token to become available again &mdash; so players have to spend their ability tokens wisely. Each character in Funkoverse is unique, so players are encouraged to try out different combinations of characters and items in order to discover their favorite synergies and powerful strategies for all four game scenarios.&#10;&#10;Funkoverse Strategy Game: DC Comics 102 is a standalone game that includes the characters Wonder Woman and Cheetah.

With the tools presented in the book you&rsquo;ll tell the story of your character who, after miraculously surviving an execution, wakes up to realize that their problems have just begun, and that there are fates worse than death.&#10;&#10;Ker Nethalas: Into the Midnight Throne uses a simple D100 ruleset to resolve all tasks. Whenever a PC tries to do something and the result isn't evident, or there is something at stake, you will need to perform a check. This is done by rolling D100, and comparing the result to the corresponding skill on the character&rsquo;s sheet. If the result is equal or lower than the skill&rsquo;s score, the check is a success.&#10;&#10;Combat is a big part of what makes Ker Nethalas: Into the Midnight Throne unique: characters need to manage their resources while being smart about their choice of powers used.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

This favors the Germans, provided that the Russians do not bring too much armor against them at once.&#10;&#10;The other key feature are the reserve rules, which allow a player to both react to the opponent's attacks and to exploit holes punched by his units.  Airpower can be used to interdict reserves - and doing so can be important to winning the game.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 1 day &#10;Hex: 1.2 miles / 2 kilometers &#10;Units: Regiment to Division&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 22 x 34&quot; full color mapsheet&#10;Two dual-side printed countersheets (360 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 24-page Ring of Fire rulebook&#10;Two dual-side printed CRT/TEC Player Aid charts&#10;Two single-side printed Player Aid cards&#10;One 6-sided dice&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: Very High&#10;Complexity Level: Medium&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 4-10 hours&#10;&#10;",

In this never-ending combat, Seth, god of darkness and chaos, prevails over Horus with the arrival of each night. However, in an eternal cycle of revenge, the victory of Horus, god of the sky, heralds the coming of each new day, continuing a cycle which has endured since the beginning of time.&#10;&#10;In the game, Horus and Seth face each other in three locations: the world of the living (the Deshret), the underworld (the Duat) and the Sun Boat, or Mandjet, which symbolises the sun&rsquo;s journey across the sky.&#10;&#10;Sunrise Sunset is a competitive game for two opponents where in each round players take turns in playing cards (up to a total of 6 each) in order to gain control of the three locations. In each location the opponent with more power takes control.&#10;&#10;The first player to deal three damage is the victor of the game.&#10;&#10;Beginning with the starting player, the players take turns to play cards one after another until they have played all of their cards  and assign it to one of the three lanes of your choice. The cards with stealth are played facedown, unlike the cards without stealth, which are played faceup.&#10;&#10;If the card that you play has a placement ability, this is applied immediately.&#10;&#10;Once each player has played all of their cards, determine who is the victor and loser in each lane. Apply all of the combat abilities of the units placed and add up the power of the cards which are placed in their area of the lane.&#10;&#10;If a player deals 3 damage or more to their opponent at any moment, the game ends immediately.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

After all stories have been told, players tuck their color cards below the word card and set it aside. After ten words have been played, the scoring phase begins. Another player selects one of the visible words for you, and your task is to recall all of the colors played by the other players and yourself without looking. You earn points for correctly naming these colors. This sounds almost impossible at first, but through the stories the colors become easier to remember. Additionally, you score points on the other players' turns when they can remember your color.&#10;&#10;You win the game if you can remember best who assigned which color to specific words and if multiple players can remember the colors you assigned to the words.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Trigger!/D&eacute;clic !? is a (French) party game testing your reaction and coordination abilities. The game is easy to learn and provides a vivid atmosphere with lots of laughter.&#10;&#10;To prepare the game, a plastic disk is placed in the centre of the table and each player marks one of his hands &quot;true&quot; and the other &quot;false&quot; (or one can say that the right hand is &quot;true&quot; and the left hand is &quot;false&quot;).&#10;&#10;In a turn, a question is read out loud and all the players have to answer with &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot; as fast as possible, using their hands. For instance, if the answer is &quot;true&quot;, one places his right hand on the plastic disk, as such creating a pile of hands on top of the disk. Please mind that the answer to the question might vary as a function of the number of players, the players itself, etc (see below). Mind that once you've put your hand, you cannot change your answer anymore.&#10;&#10;Once all players have answered the question, i.e. have placed one of their hands on the pile of hands, scoring begins. The upper hand scores +1 point if its answer is correct or -1 point if its answer is incorrect. The second hand (from the top) will score +2 if its answer is correct or -2 if its answer is incorrect, and so on. For instance, in a 8 player game, the lower hand (on the plastic disk) scores +8 points for a correct answer or -8 points for an incorrect answer.&#10;&#10;Players really have to take risks to improve their score, answering quickly and so having their hand smashed.&#10;&#10;To give you an idea of the questions, there are several types:&#10;Concerning the reader of the question (I am a man)&#10;Concerning the player (You have a dog)&#10;Concerning the environment/location (We play in a bar)&#10;General questions (King Kong was an ape)&#10;&#10;The game ends as soon as a player has scored a specific number of points, e.g. 30 points in a 8 player game.&#10;&#10;Additional rules for some variations are included (like changing hands and playing in teams).&#10;&#10;Reimplemented by:&#10;&#10;    Hand aufs Herz&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Easter Island is a tiny triangular speck of land at the eastern edge of Polynesia in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. The island has fascinated travelers, mystics, and scientists for years as people have wondered how such a small, isolated area could have been home to a society that created the world's most spectacular outdoor museum. In the 1940s, Norwegian archeologist Thor Heyerdahl sailed the reed boat Kon-Tiki from South America to Easter Island to show that the technology available made it possible for Polynesia to be settled from the Americas. In the 1970s, Erich Van Daniken popularized the idea that the world was visited by ancient astronauts and the beautiful and enormous stone statutes, the Moai, of Easter Island were used as some of his &quot;evidence.&quot;&#10;&#10;Today, scientists around the world generally agree that Easter Island was settled from other Polynesian islands to its west, and the extreme culture that produced hundreds of stone Moai is related to other cultures in the region. The history of the island is a history of constraint, and the carving of the Moai, the rapid deforestation of the island, and the limited food sources available all worked together to build an extreme culture that became the victim of its own consumption. In this way, Easter Island today represents more than just a wonderful place to travel, but also is a reminder of the greater resource limits of our entire planet. As populations continue to grow and we put further strains on sources of fuel and food, are we heading toward the same fate that this small island suffered hundreds of years ago? The island today is owned by Chile, and the small population thrives with a few weekly flights to mainland South America and the occasional cargo ship visit.&#10;&#10;Moai is a game that closely follows the developments and excesses of the island until the arrival of Dutch Admiral Jacob Roggeveen, the first European to discover the island and name it for the day of his discovery. Combining many of the historical features of the island's culture in an exciting and well-playing strategic game, players can have fun reliving the dramatic history of this exciting little island.&#10;&#10;",

In the West, bordering the Atlantic Ocean, a new country is born &ndash; Portugal. The first Portuguese kings strongly invest their efforts and scarce resources in the expansion of the territory towards South, while organizing the defense of these new borders. Castles are built and land-use contracts are given to small villages that grow bigger and gain more importance in these parts of the country.&#10;&#10;Where today exists in the County of Idanha-a-Nova a line with six castles which was formed to help in the defence of the Country and maintain distance from the kingdom of Leon. This line of Castles enabled the growth of a region that since the time of the Roman presence had an enormous importance in the interior of the peninsula.&#10;&#10;In 6 Castelos, 2 to 4 players are representatives of the king seeking to promote agriculture, free trade, religious faith and wealth for the nobles of the kingdom.&#10;&#10;Note: Solo rules are available online but do not come in the game box.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

At the end of each round, gain  points for cards in your mountain and delta.&#10;&#10;The basic rules introduce the four player actions: Weathering,  Hillslope, Fluvial, and Draw Cards. The advanced rules add details: atmospheric change, ice  ages, glaciers, flood volcanism, quakes, etc.&#10;&#10;Mountains are far more dynamic than the limitations of human  lifetimes would suggest. Their growth and death involve cycles that keep the planet habitable. The machinery of these cycles is called erosion: the weathering of rock and its transport to the sea. Once there, it is subducted into the mantle, where volcanoes return the silicates, sulfates, water, carbon dioxide, and oxygen to the surface.&#10;&#10;Almost every step of the erosion process is catalyzed by water. For instance, in your turn you may weather rock using crystallization (busting rock by growing evaporated salt crystals), then transport the remains to the River using creep (movement propelled by wet/dry and freeze/thaw cycles). Once plunked in the River, the eroded material is moved as sediment to the sea. Braided rivers carry the maximum sediment load, but they are the least stable (and the trickiest to play).&#10;&#10;The role of erosion in atmosphere control is often overlooked. Every mountain is a titanic terraformer and greenhouse gas scrubber. Weathering removes 100 billion tons of oxygen and 800 billion tons of carbon dioxide from the air each year. Although the biological functions of respiration and decay contribute more to the atmosphere than erosion, during many past episodes it was the other way around. Left unchecked, a major orogenic (mountain-building) event removes so much CO2 that the oceans would freeze over in less than an Erosion game turn (6 million years, the same scale as for the game American Megafauna). On the other hand, a major flood volcano such as the Deccan Traps has poured hundreds of trillions of tons of CO2 back into the air,  dwarfing the outputs of all human industry combined.&#10;&#10;",
