    "description": "The game is played on a hexagonal board. Each player is given six hexagonal tiles of one color (twelve, in a two-player game). In turn, players put one of their tiles on the board, with the goal of getting four-in-a-row, in a straight line. Each new tile must be placed adjacent to another one (not necessarily of their own color).&#10;&#10;When a player has no more tiles, they can move a tile of their own color to another position.&#10;&#10;If a group of tiles is isolated due to moving a tile, all isolated tiles (of the smallest group) return to their respective owners, to be used again.&#10;&#10;The first to have four pieces in a straight line wins the game. (In this game, a player MUST block the player to their left if that player is in a position to win - even if more than one player is able to win on their next turn.)&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Inspired by the traditional Italian game of Scopa, Shokoba is a card game in which two to four players play cards from their hands to collect jewel cards from the table. (With four players, Shokoba is typically played in teams.) The forty-card deck consists of 27 sapphires, 9 rubies, 3 emeralds and 1 diamond.&#10;&#10;At the start of a round, each player receives three cards in hand, and four cards are placed face-up on the table. On a turn, a player must play one card. If the value of this card equals a card on the table or is the sum of two or more cards on the table, that player must collect these cards, along with the card played; if not, the card is placed face-up on the table. If a player takes all the cards on the table, he receives a gem as a bonus point.&#10;&#10;After all players have played their three cards, they receive three more cards from the deck but no new cards are added to the table. Once players have gone through the entire deck, the game ends and five points (gems) are handed out: One to the player who collected the diamond; one each to the player who collected the most sapphires, emeralds or rubies; and one to the player who collected the most cards. In the event of ties, no one collects a point. The first player to collect eleven gems wins.&#10;&#10;",

These towering displays of ugly might not be the brightest crayons in the box, but they sure can wreck havoc in the neighborhood. Luckily they have a weakness! All you need to do is shine a ray of sunlight at their eyes, and the beasts turn to stone immediately! It's up to you and a handful of other troll hunters to use your magical lanterns and mirrors with such cunning that you can outwit a troll &mdash; which is not saying much really, but that won't stop the celebrations that shall take place to glorify the greatest troll hunter!&#10;&#10;In Troll Hunt, the players try to guide rays of light from their lanterns into the trolls' eyes by placing and moving reflecting mirrors around the board. At the end of the game the hunter who has managed to turn the most trolls to stone wins. To put shortly, it is a tactical tile placement &amp; movement game with grizzly trolls.&#10;&#10;Troll Hunt includes a modular game board depicting the countryside with meadows, lakes, mountains and troll keeps. Because you construct the board before every game, no two games are the same! The trolls don't even have the decency of showing up in a predictable order.

    "description": "SOVEREIGN OF THE SEAS is an uncomplicated war game centered on the naval aspects of the series of wars between England and the various European powers between 1756 and 1805 for dominance of the world&rsquo;s oceans.&#10;&#10;The game depicts this conflict at a strategic level, with most operational and tactical details represented by fast and easy-to-play systems, rather than intricate mechanisms.  The intent of the game is to provide a broad overview of the historical events while being fun to play.  SOVEREIGN OF THE SEAS owes its original inspiration to the game concepts of WAR AT SEA published by The Avalon Hill Game Company, a game which covered the war in the Atlantic in World War Two.  SOVEREIGN OF THE SEAS borrows a number of these concepts from this earlier game as a starting point, such as area movement, individual capital ships, individual leaders, battle line resolutions, and rolling sixes to hit, and then diverges significantly to reflect the sailing warship era situation.&#10;&#10;The object of the game for the English player is to destroy the naval forces of the  European Powers player and prevent them from obtaining control of vital sea areas around the world.  The object of the game for the European Powers player is to escape the forces of the English player and obtain temporary sea control of vital areas to support the continental and colonial objectives of various European nations.  The game uses over 650 counters, a two piece map, and numerous organization cards and play aid sheets.&#10;&#10;Product Information&#10;&#10;Complexity: 4 out of 10&#10;    Solitaire Suitability: 7 out of 10&#10;    Time Scale: Yearly turns&#10;    Map Scale: Area&#10;    Unit Scale: individuals ship&#10;    Players: 2 or solitaire&#10;    Playing Time: 3-4 hours hours&#10;    Designer: Stephen Newberg&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;Two 22 X 34 inch maps&#10;    Six Countersheets &ndash; approximately 600 counter&#10;    One Rulebook&#10;    Rules and Scenario book&#10;    Player Aid Cards&#10;    Dice&#10;    One Box and Lid set&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "In Galapa Go! (aka Kroko Togo), players have come across a newly discovered island teeming with animals both normal and not-so-normal. To be honest, they're mutants - animals with a giraffe body and alligator head. That kind of thing. Hunters are preparing to descend on the island to take home a few trophy animals, so it's up to you to save as many animals as you can. Save more than anyone else, and you win the game.&#10;&#10;The game includes a deck of 30 animal cards &ndash; each showing one or two animals of the normal or mutant variety &ndash; along with 48 criteria cards and 18 special cards. Fifteen animals are laid out face-up on the table, then a player turns over a criteria card that shows animal-claiming restrictions (e.g., you cannot claim an animal card showing any part of a lion) or requirements (e.g. you can claim only those animal cards showing a blue starfish and a giraffe).&#10;&#10;Each player has a color-coded island card, and once the criteria card is revealed, everyone races to slam their island card on an appropriate animal. Once everyone has done so or passed, they claim the card if it meets the criteria or lose a previously-claimed card if it doesn't.&#10;&#10;Once most of the animals have been claimed, the second set of 15 animal cards is added to the table. Once at most one animal card is on the table, the game ends.&#10;&#10;Galapa Go! contains two variants, one in which two criteria cards are revealed each round with animals being claimable only if they match both criteria cards, and a second in which the special criteria cards are shuffled into the deck at the start of play. These cards include conditions like claiming a non-mutant animal or claiming the animal that appears most or least frequently in play.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Viewpoint in a non-collectible card game produced by the Australian game design company 93 Made Games.  The game contents consist of a deck of 70 cards, each illustrated in a &lsquo;70s/&lsquo;80s retro art style, and a rule sheet, attractively packaged in a small black cardboard box.  Most of what you need to know is printed on the cards themselves and makes picking up and getting into the game very easy.  The use of icons on the cards, representing different aspects of the game (e.g. the discard pile, the play area and your hand of cards), makes the game even easier to understand.&#10;&#10;The game is designed for 2 to 6 players of ages 7 and up.  Games can take as little as 5 minutes or as long as 30 minutes to play - depending on the experience of players and the number of players in each game.&#10;&#10;The objective of the game is to be the first player with 100 points down on the table, which isn&rsquo;t as easy as it sounds.  Players have cards that can steal cards you have tabled or send them to the discard pile.  So you need to be able to judge the best time to put cards on the table and how to defend your cards once they are down.&#10;&#10;Game-play is highly interactive and the base rules are simple to follow to make it accessible to casual and non-gamers as well as dedicated gamers.  At the start of play, each person is dealt a hand of five cards.  These cards each have values clearly printed on them, ranging from negative amounts to a maximum of 20 points.  They also have actions printed on them, along with a graphic (which features some pun on vision such as &lsquo;wink&rsquo; or &lsquo;blind spot&rsquo;).  The action associated with an individual card is usually executed as you attempt to put the card face up into your play area (known as your Field of View).  There are a few cards (such as Spectacles) that allow you to play the card as a reaction to other players trying to affect your cards.&#10;&#10;While your first few games of Viewpoint might not appear to involve a high degree of skill for winning, you will soon discover that you need to be much more strategic about how and when you play your cards, as well as keeping a careful eye on what people have got down on the table.  Simply placing cards into your Field of View won&rsquo;t win you the game, as other players will start targeting you as you hit a score of around 80+. You need think &lsquo;out of the box&rsquo; and bluff your opponents, by sitting on a &lsquo;non-threatening&rsquo; score, while searching for cards that will let you steal cards or take multiple turns, allowing you to suddenly win the game by coming from behind.&#10;&#10;The design of the game system provides an entertaining and interactive experience encouraging replayability.  The games system also provides the opportunity to release future expansion packs of cards to add to the mischief already present in the base deck.&#10;&#10;",

For instance, a bid of &ldquo;four 5&rsquo;s&rdquo; means the bidder believes that there are at least four fives being held by all players as a group. The next player must either make a higher bid or challenge the previous bid. Once a bid is challenged, the cards are revealed. If the bid was too high, the bidder loses a card. If not, the challenger loses a card. Players try to figure out each other&rsquo;s hands by their bids, but remember, bluffing is not only legal, it&rsquo;s sometimes quite effective (unless you get challenged!)&#10;&#10;If you&rsquo;re very sure that your opponent&rsquo;s bid was too high, why not bid &ldquo;double&rdquo; and put the loss of 2 cards on the line? Of course, the bidder may turn the tables on you and &ldquo;redouble&rdquo;.

As you explore your mountainside made of cards you will encounter rockslides, yetis, and danger at every turn!&#10;&#10;You start with a deck of 18 mountain cards, laying out 15 of them face down in a pyramidal mountain and keeping the rest as your backpack. Each card has a yin or yang value of 1-4 on it as well as a special effect. To start the game, each player reveals a card in their bottom row, carries out the effect, then places their meeple on the card.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you explore an adjacent card on a non-lower level by flipping it over, carrying out its effects, and placing your meeple on it; trade a card from your backpack with a card in your mountain, pacing the replaced card in a cache; or hide a card, which is the same as trade, but on another player's mountain. If your face-up mountain cards have a balance of yin and yang, you can remove them from play.&#10;&#10;Once you reach the mountain's peak, you add your cache to your hand, then you can spend your turns doing nothing, dropping cards from your cache face up on the mountain to better balance your yin and yang, and throwing cache cards onto another player's mountain, who then flips up one of your remaining face-down cards.&#10;&#10;In the competitive game, when everyone is at the peak, players score 3, 2, and 1 flags based on who is most balanced, with ties being broken in favor of whoever ascended their mountain first; play multiple rounds until someone collects nine flags and wins. In the co-operative game, you end the game after everyone has scaled their mountain, and you all win only if everyone has an even yin-yang balance.&#10;&#10;There are also rule books for Cooperative, Solo, and Team play.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Players command four fantasy races in Kings Under Mountains &mdash; orcs, dwarves, goblins and giants &mdash; and they use these creatures to secure mines up for grabs, then develop those mines. Why would they do this for you? Because you're the king of one of these races, that's why!&#10;&#10;Each card in the 80-card deck is double-sided; one side depicts a creature from one of the four races and a numerical value (0-9), while the other side depicts a mine with a defense value, a size value, and a point value. To start the game, shuffle the deck, lay out four mines, deal each player a hand of six cards, then lay out four cards creature-side-up to form the Camp; group like creatures on top of one another. Each player also receives a King card to show which race he represents.&#10;&#10;On a player's turn, he must play a creature on (1) a mine currently up for grabs or (2) a mine that he's previously claimed. In both cases, the creature being played must have a higher number than the creature currently on top of the stack &mdash; except for a 0, which can be played on a 9. In the former case, you can play a card of any race, while in the latter case you can't play a card of your own race! When the number of cards on an available mine matches that mine's defense value, the King of the race on the card last played claims the mine. (If that race isn't in the game, whoever played the card claims the mine.) Move all of the cards played into the Camp.&#10;&#10;When the number of cards on a claimed mine matches that mine's size, discard all of the creature cards to the Camp, then place the mine under your King &mdash; unless the mine bears an overseer symbol, in which case you need to first play a creature of your own race on top of the creatures developing the mine (following the rule for how to play cards) before you can score the mine and place it under your King.&#10;&#10;To end your turn, you refill your hand to six cards by drawing the top card from the deck or from one of the four race piles in the Camp. When the deck runs out, the game ends. Players score points for all of the mine cards that they've fully developed (that is, mine cards under their King), then lose points for mines claimed but not yet developed. The player with the highest score wins!&#10;&#10;",

Teamwork is the best way to advance your research, but gnomes are naturally grumpy and uncooperative, and besides only one scientist can win the Gnobel prize.&#10;&#10;G.Nome is an innovative partnership game in which you have to balance working together to beat the other teams, while staying ahead of your partner.&#10;&#10;GAMEPLAY&#10;&#10;G.Nome is very simple and fast with a tight tactical decision in card play where most of the time you are working closely with your partner against the rival team(s) but at crucial moments you are also trying to out-negotiate and out-think your own partner.&#10;&#10;The core mechanic of G.Nome is you are competing on projects to earn research results(colored cards) that are up for grabs each turn.  The game lasts 8 rounds.  Everyone starts with a hand of 9 Teamwork cards (1-9) and each turn plays one card that will indicate how much effort you are going to put into the project, and consequently what order you will get to choose the research cards on offer.  Teamwork cards are chosen and revealed simultaneously.  If both team members play the same card they automatically lose ! Then Teammates add up their total teamwork effort for the Team Total, and the Team with the highest Total chooses first with the player in that team who played the highest card taking the pick and keeping it for himself.  Then the lowest card player in the losing team goes next.  So if you care about the cards on offer you either want to persuade your partner to play high (and play higher than him) or persuade him to go low (and go lower than him) but never risk playing the same card as him.&#10;&#10;At it's best G.Nome is for 4 players with each game having a change of partners and the highest cumulative score winning overall.&#10;&#10;",

On the room boards there are 5 empty spaces for the &quot;Hideouts&quot;.&#10;Players receive randomly 5 hideout counters each and place them &ldquo;covered&rdquo; in front of them.&#10;Finally all kittens are placed in the garden which is in the center of the table.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to get rid of all the hideout counters before your opponents. Each counter should be placed on its appropriate slot, according to the shape and color of the room.&#10;How to do it? Each turn a player move his own cat (the one corresponding to the color of his room&rsquo;s frame) and according to the his counters he chooses the room where hiding the cat. If he chooses his own room then he can place the cat on any slot of his choice. But if he chooses to move his cat to a room controlled by an opponent, it&rsquo;s up to the owner to choose where to place it.&#10;&#10;When your cat is placed on a slot that corresponds to one of your hideout counters (according to the shape and color of the room), discover it and place it on the corresponding position; but remember, each room cannot host more than one cat because they are not willing to share a territory. If you place your cat on a board occupied by another cat, the brawl starts.&#10;&#10;After this phase starts the &ldquo;Housekeeper moment&ldquo;.&#10;The current player rolls a die. All players compete to grab the matching colored kitten, wherever it is. The fastest hand moves the caught kitten to the garden and pass one of his remained counters, of his choice, to the player with less counters. If there are 2 or more opponents with the same number of counters left, he can choose the target. However he can never pass his last counter, which must necessarily be placed on the appropriate slot.&#10;&#10;The first player that remains with no hideout counters is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

After each person has had a chance to host, the player with the most money and merchandise is the winner.&#10;&#10;Two editions were made of the original 1969-74 series, although the first was reprinted (in 1971?) with an altered cover: one prize was changed to a TV, and the set shot cuts off the left side (where the host is) in favor of another prize.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;     Sale of the Century Quizzard&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Driven only by your courage, you decide to follow in the footsteps of those first explorers and launch a worldwide expedition, but you're not the only one on this quest...&#10;&#10;In Lost Explorers, each player starts with five figures on their research team: two leaders to track your discoveries, and three members to gain equipment and go on expeditions. On your turn, you can place members on one or both equipment areas to gain tokens; placing one figure means you retrieve the first token from the pile, two figures the second token, etc. The visible side of a token represents a vehicle &mdash; a train (red), a car (yellow), a boat (blue), or an airship (green) &mdash; while the hidden side depicts two or three locations on the world map. For each token you take, choose whether to keep the vehicle side face up or flip it over to reveal the mission side of the token. Once you choose, the token is locked, and you place it in front of you with your other vehicle and mission tokens.&#10;&#10;Alternatively, instead of collecting equipment you can place members on map locations. Each location shows 2-3 vehicle tiles, and you must have all depicted tiles in front of you to place a member on a location. Each time you place a member, choose one of the vehicle tokens used, then place it in the discard pile next to the box. (If you travel to the location of another player's member, you instead give them the discarded token.)&#10;&#10;After you either collect vehicle/mission tokens or send members on expeditions, you can complete one or more missions if you have a member on each of the 2-3 locations depicted on that mission. For each mission, remove one of your members just used from the board, then advance the appropriate leader on the discovery track for the color of the mission and the number of members used. (Each game, 2-4 locations are marked as &quot;validated&quot;, and a validated location is always completed automatically for missions, but you score no points for it.) If you advanced your leader who was behind on the discovery track, take a vehicle token from the discard pile and add it to your collection.&#10;&#10;When one of your leaders reaches a &quot;clue&quot; spot on a discovery track, you collect a clue token. If you collect four clue tokens first, you win! Alternatively, the game ends once all the vehicle tokens have been claimed, at which point the player who has advanced the farthest on the discovery track with their slower leader wins.&#10;&#10;",

Players then travel around the outer ring buying the things they need, and marking them off of the project cards. When the player has one or more project cards filled they can move into the inner ring and go to the room the project is for. A rating card is drawn (1-4) and a description of the project is read. The back of the project card contains four different outcomes for the project ranging from spectacular to horrible, these match the rating card and instruct the player what benefit they get from their project. Each project can add equity to your house. The first player to increase the equity of their house by $50,000 wins the game.&#10;&#10;This is a fun lighthearted look at home improvements.

    "description": "A game of moving camels across the desert. Each player has a number of camels and tries to get them across the desert first. However no-one survives in the desert alone - each camel must always be adjacent to at least one other camel.&#10;&#10;The game board depicts a desert with a starting area in one corner and a finish area in the opposite corner. There are two oasis spaces in the middle of the desert and a gorge which approximately splits the desert in two.&#10;&#10;After the initial placement of the pieces in the starting area, each player rolls all six of the dice, and moves whichever camels they want - restricted by the rule that a camel may never be by itself, but must have at least another camel in one of the 4 adjacent spaces (diagonal spaces do not count). The die roll determines how a camel may move: A 1 allows one space of diagonal or horizontal movement; a 2,3,or 4 allows the camel to move in a straight line (but not diagonally) that many spaces - it may also jump over any intervening camels; a 5 or 6 allows the camel to move that number of spaces and allows one right angle turn in the move - it may also jump over any intervening pieces.&#10;&#10;Being the first person to move a camel onto an oasis earns the player bonus points, and also being the first person to move a camel past the gorge likewise earns a player bonus points. These bonus points are added to the points earned by your camel's finishing position (ie 8 points to the first camel to get to the finish line, 6 for the second camel and 4 for the third).&#10;&#10;The person with the most points at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;",

You may invest in new trains and stations or upgrade your trains to make them go faster and carry more goods. Buy goods where they are cheap and sell them where they fetch the best price. But beware: Gangs of desperadoes hired by rival rail barons will try to hold up and rob your trains, or blow up the tracks to derail you.&#10;&#10;A roll-and-move game where you each turn will roll three dice; your large trains will move the sum of all the dice, your small trains the sum of the two highest dice and your gang of desperadoes the highest die. Pay to pick up goods in cities (small trains may carry one good while large trains may carry two) or pick up passengers for free. Deliver goods and passengers to the cities accepting them, your profit will depend on how far you moved the goods. Goods available for buying and selling are fixed for the different cities and prices are pre-printed on the board. If an opponent's train pass your gang of desperadoes you will rob the train if you roll higher on a die than your opponent does (trains cannot change direction and are forced to use the entire die roll and hence you can maneuver to force them into your ambush). Other features are &quot;telegrams&quot; (a la community chest cards), marshals and sticks of dynamite...&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to be the first to reach a given number of &quot;success points&quot; (victory points), which you get for buying trains and stations and for cash in hand.&#10;&#10;",

As in xiangqi, it is played on the vertices of the grid. The board is divided into two lang territories by a river in the middle of the board. The three files on one side of the board form the sea. The object of the game is to capture the opponent's Commander, or all units of a single division of the opponent's army.&#10;&#10;The pieces on both sides, with their abbreviations, movements, and rules, are:&#10;&#10;&#10;     1 Commander (C): moves any distance orthogonally; captures 1 point orthogonally; may occupy Headquarters; may not &quot;see&quot; the opposing Commander on an open file&#10;     2 Infantry (I): 1 point orthogonally&#10;     2 Tanks (T): 2 points orthogonally; may capture on sea squares it cannot enter, remaining stationary; carries C, In, or M&#10;     1 Militia (M): 1 point orthogonally&#10;     2 Engineer (E): 1 point orthogonally; carries all pieces, only across river; controls airspace 1 point any direction&#10;     2 Artillery (A): 1&ndash;3 points any direction; crosses river only at reefs, by attacking, or carried&#10;     2 Anti-aircraft gun (AA): 1 point orthogonally; may capture on sea squares it cannot enter; controls airspace 1 point any direction&#10;     1 Missile Rocket (R): 1&ndash;2 points orthogonally or 1 point diagonally; controls airspace as it moves&#10;     2 Air force (AF): 1&ndash;4 points any direction; may return to its departing point after capturing or carrying, unless capturing opposing Af; carries C, In, or M; destroyed immediately on passing through opposing airspace&#10;     2 Navy (N): 1-4 points any direction on sea, sea banks, and river banks; captures as it moves at sea; shoots 1&ndash;3 in any direction at land targets; controls airspace 1 point any direction&#10;     2 Commander Base (B): stationary and does not capture; may house only C; protects C, but not itself, from In, M, Aa, and Ms&#10;&#10;&#10;General rules:&#10;&#10;     Pieces capture as they move, and never jump, unless noted.&#10;     Pieces can cross the river but not occupy sea points unless noted.&#10;     Pieces which check the opposing Commander are promoted, gaining special abilities.&#10;&#10;&#10;The Chinese xiangqi has generally been the most popular form of chess played in Vietnam. In fact, there is no traditional distinctively-Vietnamese chess game; which is partly what inspired C&#225;&#187;&#157; t&#198;&#176; l&#225;&#187;&#135;nh.&#10;&#10;C&#225;&#187;&#157; t&#198;&#176; l&#225;&#187;&#135;nh is played on the vertices of an 11x12 &quot;geographic&quot; board similar to the 9x10 xiangqi board, with the addition of an ocean occupying files A&ndash;C and two &quot;reefs&quot; allowing all pieces to ford the river. It shares many features with wargames, including area denial, ranged attack, and unit cooperation.&#10;&#10;Besides the fact that Vietnam has never had a distinctive regional form of chess, Nguy&#225;&#187;&#133;n noted four complaints with xiangqi influenced the creation of C&#225;&#187;&#157; t&#198;&#176; l&#225;&#187;&#135;nh:&#10;&#10;1. Xiangqi promotes individualism and class conflict, particularly in the willingness of players to sacrifice low-level pieces to succeed.&#10;2. Winning xiangqi is due more to luck than to intellect.&#10;3. Xiangqi does not reflect the geography and history of Vietnam.&#10;4. Xiangqi has many rule variantions, none of which are accepted by the entire community.&#10;&#10;Each of these points is answered in C&#225;&#187;&#157; t&#198;&#176; l&#225;&#187;&#135;nh:&#10;&#10;1. Pieces cooperate through a &quot;carrying&quot; and area denial mechanics. As well, losing an entire class of piece loses the game, forcing protection of and cooperation among all classes.&#10;2. Nguy&#225;&#187;&#133;n believes the interactions between pieces and influence of geography necessitate more strategy and reduce the role of luck.&#10;3. Besides the single river of xiangqi, there is an ocean, as well as &quot;reefs&quot; across the river, all of which interact with special piece rules. Besides the Vietnam-like geography, the pieces modern rather than ancient military structure.&#10;4. By promoting C&#225;&#187;&#157; t&#198;&#176; l&#225;&#187;&#135;nh educational programs, Nguy&#225;&#187;&#133;n hopes to ensure that a single authoritative set of rules is used by all players.&#10;&#10;",

(You play cards of both colors, and you always know exactly which cards your nemesis has remaining in hand)&#10;&#10;The Board is a 6x6 grid and each round the dice are used to find a space on it where 'Mayhem' happens.  Players move and play a card face down after the first die roll (before the exact location of Mayhem is known), and then move again after the second die roll.&#10;&#10;Players can end in 3 configurations- Sharing a space, one player at the mayhem, or neither player at the mayhem.  Each configuration results in 1 of 3 showdowns (Brawn, Speed, and Wits, respectively) where cards resolve differently.&#10;-Sometimes the high card wins, sometimes a Decoy wins, and sometimes cards of the same color are lost.&#10;&#10;Victorious cards are set by one side of the board, and defeated cards are set by another.  Win when there are 5 victory cards of your color, or 5 defeated cards of your nemesis' color.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to anticipate what your opponent will do, and to trick him into thinking he knows what you're up to.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Commissario Brunetti has a new case. One person is missing. Two policemen, Brunetti and his wife are looking for them, asking the witnesses and looking who of the suspicios persons &quot;dunit&quot;. The capabilities are asymmetrical. The police force can arrest, but Mrs. Brunetti is better in questioning.&#10;&#10;Witnesses are around the city venice (tiles) and must be visited by die rolls or special cards (police boat for example). Then they are questioned. The witnesses are on cards in a 2-witness-row and a 3-witness-row. As soon as a witness card row is full a suspect must be arrested and brought to the police. Those are then held in the police headquarters in a row of 3 and a row of 4. A full row means one of the suspect gets removed and he/she is the murderer...&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "In the game of &#227;&#131;&#150;&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#131;&#144;&#227;&#131;&#153;&#227;&#131;&#171; (ButaBabel), you are a pig who takes charge of building your Tower of Babel (&quot;Buta&quot; means Pig in Japanese). Your duty is to build a higher tower than everyone else.&#10;&#10;Each card has one of rock-paper-scissors symbol. You can easily increase the height of your tower by placing a card from your hand onto your pile of cards, so that your card can defeat the top card of that pile.&#10;&#10;But if you have built your tower too much higher than your opponents, the God gets angry and destroys your tower.&#10;&#10;You can also raise opponents' towers in the same manner, so you should watch every tower and keep your tower at moderate height, though this game proceeds in real time so fast that you don't have enough time to watch closely.&#10;&#10;When the players have exhausted the decks, the round ends and players compare towers by counting the cards stacked in each. In a three-player game, there is a fourth dummy tower as well. The tallest tower wins, unless it is three or more cards higher than the next highest tower. If it is too high, it's eliminated (tying towers likewise). Then compare the next highest tower to see if it is too high and so on. This way, it is possible for the dummy player to win.&#10;&#10;The game is published with Japanese and English rules.&#10;&#10;ButaBabel was re-issued in 2016 as a new version &#227;&#130;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#139;&#227;&#131;&#144;&#227;&#131;&#153;&#227;&#131;&#171; (Onibaberu).&#10;&#10;    This game is based on the Touhou Project video game.&#10;    The contents of the game are the same as Butababeru (only the art is different).&#10;&#10;&#10;Players become tengus and kappas that have been invited to a banquet of demons. Your goal is to drink just the right amount of alcohol and get home as fast as you can, before you can&rsquo;t leave at all!&#10;&#10;The drinking is the easy part. All you do is stack up the cards in the way the rules tell you. But, drink too much and the demons will take a liking to you, and you won't be allowed to leave!&#10;&#10;If you don&rsquo;t want a drink that&rsquo;s made its way to your hand, you can also force the other players to take drink cards. Keep a close eye on your banquet buddies to make sure you don&rsquo;t end up with too many drinks! Know your limit and drink just the right amount.&#10;&#10;Those who drink too much drop out of the game, but those who don&rsquo;t drink enough won&rsquo;t please the demons, so balance is

The lead player rolls 1-3 dice of a color (the suit), then the other players try to roll in-suit to get the highest value on the table. If you do not have the right suit, then you can roll for trump; rolling a natural 6 on one of your dice in an off-suit will beat the highest value in-suit.&#10;&#10;Winning a trick gives you gold. The game ends following a number of rounds played equal to the number of players, at which time whoever has the most gold wins.&#10;&#10;But wait, there are cards in the game, too! These cards give special abilities which are paid for, or activated with, dice of particular colors. Some of the effects include flipping your dice or an opponent's dice to their opposite sides, removing dice, re-rolling dice, and automatically winning with a particular roll!&#10;&#10;",

As soon as the board rocks away from you, it can rock back! Place the Game Tray on the playing surface between players. Players take the balls of their color and place them into their ball holder trays. The game begins when a player draws one of the uniquely designed challenge cards and faces it up. Each player tries to tries bounce their balls into the tray to match the design on the card. Players keep bouncing until somebody matches the design, and then that player takes the card! Bounce-Off Rock &lsquo;N&rsquo; Rollz offers tons of action-packed fun that tests your skills and coordination. Win the game and declare yourself Master of the Universe. And don&rsquo;t forget the trash talking!&#10;&#10;The rocking base is removable to play an easier version of the game.&#10;&#10;",
