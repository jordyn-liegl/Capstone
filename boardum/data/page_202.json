Natt&#197;&#141; is fermented soya beans, a side dish which people either love or hate.&#10;&#10;Players work to make their ideal bowl of Natto rice by adding the toppings they like, avoiding the toppings they don't, and mixing their Natto to the perfect gooey consistency.&#10;&#10;Each player gets two &quot;preference&quot; cards that only they see.

While you lunch the app, you've got 60 seconds to successfully disarm a bomb.&#10;&#10;To do this, all players receive 4 cards. When you get the bomb in front of you, you'll have to play two cards. If you can make a symbol by pairing the good cards, you'll be allowed to do the corresponding action on the bomb.&#10;&#10;For example, by playing two cards with a red wire, you'll be allowed to cut a red wire from the bomb. You can also add time, get information on the wires, flee or prepare your interview. After playing two cards, you realise the action on the bomb, you give it to the next player and you take 2 cards.&#10;&#10;Last point is, while a player handle the bomb, all other players can exchange their cards. The only restriction is not to show your cards.&#10;&#10;To disarm the bomb, you'll have to cut 3 good wire. But there are also 3 trapped wires that make the bomb explode if you cut them all. When you think the operation will be a failure, you better have to flee.&#10;&#10;If the game seems cooperative at the first play, it isn't. If the bomb is defused, only the players who stay in the team get 2 points. If the bomb explode, only the ones who flee get 1 point.&#10;&#10;In an advanced mode, you get a random objective for the round. So for example, you'll get one point if you cut all the blue wire ... even if the bomb explode.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "The legendary Sannikov Land is discovered at last! Civilization ambassadors from all over the world move to the small piece of land lost somewhere in the Arctic. The are ready to offer the aboriginal Onkilon tribe various civilization achievements, from clock and football to submarines and atheism, as an exchange for the natural resources of the island. But still, it&rsquo;s quite necessary for envoys at least to explain the indigenes what are they talking about before persuading them to buy all these surely useful miracles of culture, science and engineering because the only way to talk to the Onkilons is in primitive pictograms which represent simple words such as &ldquo;fish&rdquo;, &ldquo;mother&rdquo;, &ldquo;egg&rdquo;, &ldquo;cold&rdquo; or &ldquo;above&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;My Understands You is a board game of associations and creative thinking. Players one after another take a role of civilization ambassador, who should explain any expression of the modern world using simple images. Others play as the Onkilons and try to guess what the guest of the Big world is talking about. Victory points charge by right conjectures and understandable explanations. When everyone will play as an envoy for 2 to 5 times, depending to the number of players, the game ends and the winner is defined according to the earned points.&#10;&#10;At the game beginning each player gets a set of the voting tiles with the numbers from 1 to 6 on them and 3 stake tiles: smoked herring, reindeer hide and mammoth tusk. By the way, players acquire 3 big cards with civilization achievements, 2 words on each (for example, &ldquo;oil derrick&rdquo;, &ldquo;backpack&rdquo;, &ldquo;deodorant&rdquo;, &ldquo;calculator&rdquo;) and 6 small cards with pictograms (such as &ldquo;woman&rdquo;, &ldquo;bird&rdquo;, &ldquo;loud&rdquo;, &ldquo;night&rdquo;).&#10;&#10;Each turn the envoy puts his achievement cards in a column. Upper word or phrase is counted as the first, the one under it as the second and all way down to the lower as the sixth one. Then the envoy decides which of the achievements he will explain with the gained pictograms. He should use 2 or 3 small cards: for example, &ldquo;water&rdquo;, &ldquo;fire&rdquo; and &ldquo;below&rdquo; for &ldquo;oil derrick&rdquo;. After the decision about the achievement and its explanation he puts the needed small cards with face up and the number tile face down.&#10;&#10;Other players acting as the Onkilons join the round. They try to guess which of 6 achievements the presenter is trying to show. They find the word or phrase on the big cards that is the most suitable for the played pictograms and lay out the appropriate number tiles face down as well. Also the indigenes need to use one of the stake tiles. Victory points depend on the stake if the word hypothesis will be right: 1 point for a herring, 2 for a hide and 3 for a tusk.&#10;&#10;When all the Onkilons have made their choice, everyone turns the voting tiles face up to see who guessed the achievement correctly. If all the players guessed or nobody did (in other words, the explanation was very clear or too complicated), tribesmen get 1 point each and the ambassador has nothing. If the right choice was made only by few natives, they get points according to their stakes and the envoy gains points for the biggest stake of the correct answer. &#10;Ex-presenter takes new cards in exchange for used and hand over the turn.&#10;&#10;My Understands You suits for the company of friends and for families as well. The most comfortable gameplay is for the 3-4 players &ndash; everyone can be a presenter for enough turns. Still the game can become longer for more player as well: achievement cards can be played for another round. Even if you&rsquo;ll get the same words, the explanations can be fully different so it will let you discover lots of imagination inside your mind that you didn&rsquo;t even suspect of.&#10;&#10;",

Feedback from play by several thousand customers has made it possible to provide free update sheets available in return for a stamped addressed envelope or international reply coupon. A few of the amendments blocked minor loopholes, most clarify meanings and some incorporate goal ideas for improvements suggested and justified by players. All such changes to date are incorporated into the text of this printing of the rule book as Version 7.5.&#10;&#10;Seventh was a revolutionary, rather than evolutionary, change from previous editions. It places much more emphasis on realism, the problems of command, terrain and natural conditions, and seeks to distract players from excessive pre&mdash;occupation with weapon and amour differences important only if &ldquo;all things are equal&rdquo;. It is the function of the general to ensure that things are NEVER equal! We also take the view that a putative difference in weapon characteristics that cannot be shown to have influenced tactics in, or the result of, at least one historical battle is likely to be spurious. The tendency sung rule writers to show off their knowledge rather than produce the simplest realistic simulation is natural but unhelpful.&#10;&#10;The unanimous conclusion of the users is that seventh is far more realistic than other sets and greatly widens the gap between good and poor tacticians. They applaud the end of the &quot;fire work display&rdquo; with units whizzing off in all directions without getting in each other&rsquo;s way the increased mobility out of and the reduced maneuverability in proximity to the enemy the need to take conditions, terrain and the chance of a surprise into account when planning, the way the fatigue rules force a proper use of reserves, the way rebased troops no longer fall over in the box, and not least, the discomfiture of rule lawyers.&#10;&#10;Since its introduction, seventh has been used in the great majority of tournaments around the world, and even passed the fearsome test of the Milton Keynes 36 hour sleepless marathon event. Tournaments normally use the full rules with terrain choice, weather, unusual deployments and unreliable generals without these causing any difficulty or complaint of unfairness. A public demonstration game at Northern Militaire with one player per side each using 3,600 points of 25mm figures on a 6 foot x 4 foot table with plenty of terrain finished with a decisive win in something over two hours. This implies that increased realism has not been achieved at the cost of &ldquo;playability&rdquo;. Gums now play &lsquo;inch quicker.&#10;&#10;The major difficulty faced by players transferring from the previous editions is one of imagination. It DOES help to plan as if you wore commanding a real army rather than trying to analyze the rules to deduce goal tactics. Cannon mistakes are to leave cavalry at the rear of a marching column instead of scouting in front, keeping the general safe instead of in a position to see, letting an unreliable general continue disobedience instead of correcting him, ignoring terrain difficulties when deploying, with consequent traffic jams when moving out, accepting waver tests instead of avoiding then like the plague, deploying front and rear lines too close so that they became entangled, and leaving front line units to become exhausted or be overwhelmed instead of reinforcing or withdrawing then in goal tine. Victory with seventh edition goes to the player who has best learned the skills of real historical generals, not he with most grasp of the minutiae of the rules.&#10;&#10;Finally, although 7th is simpler than its predecessor and much simpler than its rivals, it is necessarily complex and needs large numbers of figures, a full sized table, and two or mare hours to play. For those occasions for which it will not suit, we recommend our other rule set for the period, the very successful &ldquo;De Bellis Antiquitatis&rdquo;. DBA allows much quicker games with far fewer figures on a 24&rdquo; square terrain, incorporates a campaign systen and army lists, and is especially suitable for beginners, the young, jaded elders, large multi-player gases and odd moments&#10;&#10;",

To do so, the players help to build the Grand Canal of China and to construct the Forbidden City. The player who avoids riots and insurrections and who can prove their skill in developing the canal system to the Grand Coordinator has the best chances to win.&#10;&#10;In Da Yunhe: Der Grosse Kaiserkanal, the players are Chinese canal inspectors in the year 1400 who are responsible for developing the canal system in the northern Chinese territory. In the first phase of a turn, the players draft action cards in order to use these in the second phase. The action cards have three actions, which all can be used partially or in whole, and in any possible playing order. The players can always get new tiles, and they have the option to build canal tiles on the board or in the Forbidden City. The players can use riot tiles against competitors to damage their competitor's reputation at Court. The building of canals is rewarded with an instant gain of reputation. The building in the Forbidden City allows a leap forward at the end of the game in the final count.&#10;&#10;In the third phase of each turn, the Great Coordinator inspects the development of the Grand Canal and grants additional points if it is possible to travel along the canal. If he steps on riot tiles, the player responsible for the territory with the riot loses reputation. In phase four, riot tiles that had been removed from the board might lead to an insurrection, with the player(s) responsible suffering a loss of reputation. In the fifth phase of the turn, the players return the used action cards and exchange the starting player marker, then the new starting player (clockwise from the next player) begins the next turn.&#10;&#10;The players play as many turns necessary to allow the Great Coordinator four journeys along the Great Canal. The players gain reputation at Court by building canals and the Forbidden City and successful inspections by the Great Coordinator and lose reputation through insurrections and hostile actions of other players. The player with the highest reputation wins.&#10;&#10;",

Scribe scrolls to receive additional points and powerful bonus actions. Be careful, however! As your obelisk rises in height, the shadow it casts will begin to obscure the symbols on your wall, making them unavailable for you to use!&#10;&#10;Each player is given a game sheet which contains a construction area for their obelisk, a wall filled with symbols, and three scrolls. In the middle of the table is a pool of three workers, represented by square tiles.&#10;&#10;A player turn consists of two steps: Tick and Write.&#10;&#10;Tick&#10;The active player selects a single worker and rotates it one step clockwise.&#10;&#10;Write&#10;All players must write a symbol onto their game sheet. The active player copies the shape depicted at the top of the ticked worker onto their sheet. All other players copy the shape depicted at the bottom of the ticked worker onto their sheet.&#10;&#10;This step is carried out simultaneously by all players.&#10;&#10;You may freely rotate or mirror the shape before marking it on your game sheet.&#10;&#10;There are three possible locations where you can use the shape, but you may only draw the shape once, choosing between:&#10;&bull; Building the Obelisk&#10;&bull; Carving Symbols&#10;&bull; Scribing a Scroll (if the shape is a square)&#10;&#10;Building the Obelisk&#10;Draw the shape onto the obelisk construction area of your game sheet. The shape must fit fully and may not overlap any portion of a previously marked shape or overhang the sides of the obelisk. The shape must also rest on top of a previously marked shape or the base of the obelisk itself.&#10;&#10;Carving Symbols&#10;Draw the shape onto the wall covered with symbols. Copy the enclosed symbols (without rearranging them) onto a previously built portion of the obelisk.&#10;&#10;Be careful, however!

On a future turn you can activate the scroll to perform a bonus action (allowing you an additional Tick-and-Write sequence, without the other players being able to benefit).&#10;&#10;End of the Game&#10;Once any player has reached the top level of the obelisk, the current round will be the final round of the game.&#10;&#10;Scoring&#10;For each column in your obelisk, score victory points based on having multiple identical symbols.&#10;&#10;For each row in your obelisk, score victory points based on having multiple different symbols.&#10;&#10;Score additional victory points for completing various obelisk levels or filling scrolls.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Partners Duo is a 2-player version of the Partners game. Just like partners you have to get your pawns from the home area to the target as fast as possible. Pawns are moved clockwise along the track according to the value of the card played, unless the card allows you to do something else (move backwards, split the value, swap spaces, put another pawn into play, etc.) Players are dealt 4 cards, and then have to swap one of the cards with their opponent (instead of their partner). The winner is the player who first get all his pawns (two set of three) placed in the target area.&#10;&#10;Differences from the original edition include:&#10;1) You do not play as a pair, but only 1-vs-1&#10;2) You swap a card with your opponent instead of your partner. This is very different, since your choice directly influence what your opponent can do, and your opponent also knows one of your cards.&#10;3) You have to get 2 sets of 3 pawns around the track (instead of one set of 4 pawns.&#10;4) Many of the cards have changed, now the highest card is 10 instead of a 14, and there are new abilities on some of the cards.&#10;5) The track is a bit smaller, 40 space around instead of 56 spaces.&#10;&#10;",

After eight hundred years of dominance, the armored horseman again became a second class warrior. The game shows how, and why, infantry lost their traditional dominance -- and how they regained it. There are 20 different games.  Each is a historical battle with its own order of battle, set-up and victory conditions.

    "description": "The Great Pond is a world of myths, mystery, political intrigue and turmoil, ageless myths and budding legends, and of course, the magically-inclined fish called whiskers! In the Whiskers universe, species of koi and catfish experienced rapid evolution many centuries ago after a world-changing magic spell was cast to return life to the world. At that time, a global catastrophe had nearly wiped away nearly all the living things in the world, but one very old wizard still lived. That wizard sacrificed himself to bring life back to the barren world, creating the whiskers and imbuing them with some of his magical powers in the process. After generations of building, the whiskers have blossomed into several different cultures, societies, and nations.&#10;&#10;To begin, each player becomes an adventuring fish-person, known as a Whisker, living in the world of The Great Pond. Players represent themselves with one of several CHAMPIONS, each representing powerful, famous, infamous, or otherwise well-known whiskers of the pond.  Whiskers themselves are huge fans of the game Last Fish! and often play to settle disputes, place bets, win glory, or otherwise pass the time. The game itself is based around some of the spells, skills, items, and locations that might be encountered during one&rsquo;s travels through The Great Pond.&#10;&#10;The game uses two main decks, the Draw Deck and the Encounter Deck. The cards in the Encounter Deck represent random events that a CHAMPION might face when adventuring in the world of The Great Pond. They have the unique ability to affect a myriad of players all at once, and their effects are not always good. ENCOUNTER cards include events like monster attacks, finding items, exploring locations, etc. that can drastically alter the game at any moment.&#10;&#10;Each CHAMPION, all of whom start with 3 HEARTS (health points &ndash; represented by 3 HEART cards), draw from both decks at the beginning of their turns. To win, you have to reduce the HP of all other CHAMPIONS to 0.&#10;&#10;To decide who goes first, play rock-paper-scissors (or whatever else you can think of)! The winner chooses their CHAMPION card first, and then the next player, and so on. Each player sets (3) HEART cards next to their CHAMPION then draws (5) cards from the Draw Deck.&#10; If either the Draw Deck or the Encounter Deck run out of cards then shuffle and flip the respective Discard Pile face down and proceed using that as the new deck to draw from. Any card mentioning the Discard Pile is referring specifically to the Draw Deck&rsquo;s Discard Pile.&#10; Note: Players cannot play ATTACK or CURSE cards on their first turn (ie: on the first player's first turn, second player's first turn, etc.).&#10;&#10;Every turn, each player faces a number of choices available to them. Turns follow a clear order for actions, which must be obeyed at all times and is outlined below:&#10;&#10;1) DRAW a card from the Draw Deck and add it to your hand, then&hellip;&#10;&#10;2) DISCOVER a card from the Encounter Deck and follow its effect, then set it face up in the Encounter Discard Pile. Next&hellip;&#10;&#10;3) The CURRENT PLAYER can choose 1 of 2 main actions per turn (after they are done following the effect of the ENCOUNTER card they drew), they can either:&#10;3a) DRAW until their hand has 5 cards in it; if they already have 5 or more cards, they DRAW (1). After drawing, they end their turn immediately OR&hellip;&#10;3b) Do any or all of the following actions in whatever order they prefer:&#10;-Use as many SPELLS as they want&hellip;&#10;-Use as many INSTANTS they want&hellip;&#10;-Play one CURSE card&hellip;&#10;-Choose between equipping an ITEM card to their CHAMPION OR playing an ATTACK card targeting an opposing player.&#10;&#10;4) END YOUR TURN. Notify the other players that your turn is over. Then, the turn order moves clockwise, so next is the player to the left of the last.&#10;&#10;",

The Korean version of dominoes are called kol-hpai (meaning &quot;bone tablets&quot;) or sometimes ho-hpai (&quot;Barbarian tablets&quot;) - possibly linked to the attitude of the korean nobility towards the game.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;ComponentsChinese Dominoes  differ from Western Dominoes in the number and distribution of the tiles, as well as the games that are traditionally played with them.&#10;&#10;A set consists of 32 tiles of a double-six pattern, distributed as follows:&#10;Two copies of 1-1, 1-3, 1-5, 1-6, 2-2, 3-3, 4-4, 4-6, 5-5, 5-6 and 6-6.&#10;One copy of 1-2, 1-4, 2-3, 2-4, 2-5, 2-6, 3-4, 3-5, 3-6 and 4-5.&#10;&#10;These differ from Western Dominoes in that they have no blanks.  The tiles are made up of the 21 different combinations of two six-sided dice thrown, plus the 11 &quot;duplicate copies&quot; listed above.&#10;&#10;The pips for one and four are colored red.  All other numbers are white, with the exception of six, which is half-and-half.  These colors have significance in the Chinese games.  Asian Dice have the one and four pips colored red as well.&#10;&#10;Pai Gow and Tien Gow (Sky Nine) are popular games played with Chinese Dominoes.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "The U.S. - Indian conflicts, a tragic period of history.&#10;&#10;Each turn, players are randomly assigned a side to play -- either Indian tribes or the U.S. Only one player represents the U.S. each turn, while the other players each have a number of Indian tribes under their control. Indian players get to select one or two of their active tribes, but the rest are dealt to them randomly. There are usually more Indian tribes available than what are active each turn, but players don't really know which ones are inactive.  This can be unsettling to the U.S. player as he must decide where to deploy his limited troops and columns.&#10;&#10;All players compete to earn victory points.  The U.S. player is faced with the task of building up sufficient resources (settlements, towns, railroads, mines, etc.) to maintain existing states and convert territories into states. The Indian players play the role of guerrillas to earn victory points, but also can deny resources to the U.S. player. However, he must be very careful not to suffer too many casualties, as this could cause his tribe to go on reservation or become extinct, which costs the player dearly in victory points.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "In The Red Claw, players are agents who have been compromised and must now flee. Every player is on their own and does not care about the fate of the others...&#10;&#10;The idea is based on a real situation in the 1970s when high class Stasi Agent Werner Stiller fled from East Germany towards FRG. When he left GDR, he took many classified documents with him that compromised hundreds of Stasi Agents deployed in West Germany. They immediately had to flee to avoid being captured. However the game does not adopt this scenery 100%, so players will not play Stasi Agents.&#10;&#10;At its core, The Red Claw is a damage avoidance game. Cards are put on the table in four rows of different colors. At their end are two tokens, usually with tracking (damage) points, and on the other end are the counteragents...&#10;&#10;In turn order, players play one of the cards in their hands. It contains two symbols. The Counter Agent of each corresponding row moves one card tile per symbol. All cards it touches go into the active player's hand. If a row is empty, the tokens at its end are scored. Whoever possesses more cards of the corresponding color &quot;wins&quot; the token and gets it. (Actually players usually want to avoid winning these tokens.) In case of a tie, the player with cards with the higher number gets it. This player then puts its cards of the corresponding color on the discard pile. Now the same procedure is done again for the second token.&#10;&#10;The discard pile of this color is shuffled and players buld a a new row from it and reveal new tokens.&#10;&#10;The game ends if one player has a certain number of tracking points. Points get counted, and whoever has the least wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Rummy 17 is a somewhat standard rummy game in that players want to meld sets and runs &mdash; and play cards on the sets and runs of others &mdash; in order to rid themselves of cards. A round ends whenever one player discards their final card, then everyone else loses 1 or 2 points for each card still in hand.&#10;&#10;At the start of a round, five goal cards are chosen at random from the deck, and at the end of the round each player who has satisfied a goal card scores points for doing so. On a turn, a player draws the top card from either the deck or the discard pile; if they draw from the deck, then other players have the option of knocking to take the top card from the discard pile. A player must lay down a set or run of at least three cards before being able to play on opponents' sets and runs, and a player must discard one card at the end of their turn, including their final turn when they go out.&#10;&#10;After a predetermined number of rounds, whoever has the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;Rummy 17 includes one joker card in each of the five suits, with each suit being numbered 1-17. A player can use the joker when laying down a run as long as the run includes at least three numbered cards. This joker can be replaced with the actual number on a later turn as long as the player who does so immediately uses the joker in a new run.&#10;&#10;",

Among exquisite guests there&rsquo;s a whole cross-section of South American fauna, with the titular rodents as the most prominent. Players can expect the finest tea, but also lots of biscuits and gossip. However, despite their innate hospitality, the capybaras have a hidden agenda: they want as many biscuits left in their paws as possible.

As a reward, this player takes the top card from the drawing stack and receives biscuit tokens valued equal to that card&rsquo;s value.&#10;&#10;Round scoring: from among the cards left in their hands, each player picks one highest-valued card per owned animal type and puts biscuit tokens valued equal to the total value of these cards into the common pool.&#10;&#10;If, after the round is scored, one or more players loses all their biscuit tokens, the game ends, and the player with the highest-value biscuit collection wins.&quot;&#10;&#10;PL version:&#10;W trakcie rozgrywki gracze wcielaj&#196;&#133; si&#196;&#153; w kapibary urz&#196;&#133;dzaj&#196;&#133;ce herbaciane przyj&#196;&#153;cie dla swoich przyjaci&oacute;&#197;&#130;.

Game takes about 10 minutes to learn and 1-2 hours to play, high solitaire playability.  The rules are as simple as possible. Units have Zones of control, which cannot be exited. When in enemy ZOC, combat is mandatory. Units may advance after combat. Retreats through ZOCs are forbidden, so you need to surround the enemy to eliminate him. Artillery may fire two hexes away (and not suffer from adverse results). Cavalry units are just faster and weaker infantry units .  There are two scenarios.  The historical one pictures Napoleon in Jena, outnumbering the Prussians, and Davout in Auerstadt, outnumbered by other Prussians. ). To win, you have to eliminate as many enemy units as possible at the end of the game (thus demoralizing the enemy).  The second &quot;what-if&quot; scenario assumes that all the Prussians have been sent to Jena, for the decisive battle. Davout will enter as reinforcement, on the flank/back of the Prussians, but in the end of the game.

    "description": "Game description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Red Dragon, Blue Dragon: The Huaihai 1948-49 is an operational-level game about the largest and most decisive battle of the Chinese Civil War: the Battle of the Huai-Hai. This showdown determined that the Nationalist forces of Jiang Jieshi (Chiang Kai-Shek) would be driven from the mainland into exile on Taiwan. It was the culmination of 20 years of on-again-off-again civil war between the Nationalists and the Communists.&#10;&#10;In 1946, the eight-year-long truce between Nationalists and Communists that had held together during the War of Resistance against Japan finally broke down. Both sides raced to seize cities and rail lines in China formerly held by the Japanese. By November, 1948, the Nationalists had suffered severe reverses in Manchuria and the north. The Communist leadership decided the time had come to move into central China, so they targeted the area around the strategically crucial city of Xuzhou, about halfway between Beijing (Peking) and Nanjing (Nanking). The result was an enormous battle of annihilation that involved over half a million fighters on each side. The Communists also mobilized as many as five million peasants to help move supplies.&#10;&#10;This is very much an Against The Odds! situation: The Nationalists are well-armed with air support, artillery, road mobility, and tanks. And yet it is the Nationalists who are going up &quot;against the odds&quot;! Despite their material superiority, most Nationalist units have morale so low that &quot;defectors&quot; from their army are the main source of replacements for the Communists! The Communists are light, lean, and very well-motivated. The battle develops asymmetrically between the powerful but ponderous Nationalists and the mobile Communists.&#10;&#10;Designed by Earl Dixon, Red Dragon, Blue Dragon: The Huaihai 1948-49 features a map drawn to 20 kilometers per hex, with one week turns. There are over 150 unit counters and markers. Units are mostly Nationalist &quot;Corps&quot; and Communist &quot;Columns&quot; of about 20,000-30,000 soldiers. There are also artillery regiments and tank battalions: the Communists have a few; the Nationalists have a lot more. Both sides are subdivided (as they were historically) into &quot;sub-commands.&quot; The rules cover unique aspects of this struggle: Nationalist Defections, Communist Guerrillas, the Propaganda Offensive, Communist &quot;Short Attacks&quot;, Communist Re-Education, Red Militia, Nationalist Final Defense Positions, and more. Players may discern the early origins of the ferocious Red Chinese attack against UN forces in Korea a mere two years after this battle, as well as elements of guerrilla warfare that later became familiar in Vietnam.&#10;&#10;Virtually unknown in the West, this battle is quite familiar to mainland Chinese and to those on Taiwan as well. It's a fair description to call it the &quot;Gettysburg&quot; of the Chinese Civil War.&#10;&#10;",

Only the choir of crickets breaks the tedious silence between the two travelers. The knight looks up and sights something in the distance. A gleam in his eyes appears from excitement.&#10;&ndash; Another giant! Quickly, my lance! &ndash; yells at his faithful companion.&#10;&ndash; But my good sir, it's only a windmill! &ndash; blinks the stumpy man towards the distant silhouette.&quot;&#10;&#10;Tilting at Windmills is a two-player game in which players control Don Quixote and Sancho Panza. The two characters move towards each other on the playing board. Players use movement cards to move either the knight or his companion. One round lasts until the two characters meet on the road. At the end of each round, a player gets a windmill/giant card with a victory point on it.&#10;&#10;There are two ways of winning the game. Either you collect more points than your opponent, or you force them to break all their lances; a player loses lances if they acquire a card with its giant side. The key tactic for this game is to force encounters at the right place and in the right time by adding up movement cards.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "(from Decision Games' website:)&#10;&#10;Breitenfeld was the first major clash involving the Swedish army of Gustavus Adolphus. Gustavus had adopted the advances of Maurice of Nassau, using smaller, thinner formations bringing mobility and flexibility to battlefields dominated by massive blocks of musket-ringed pikemen. But he faced a larger, more experienced Imperial army under Count Tilly, and had to rely on shaky Saxon allies. The battle becomes a contest between Swedish quickness and Imperial stolidity. Victory will go to the player who best utilizes his strengths and takes advantage of enemy weaknesses.&#10;&#10;Breitenfeld uses the new Pike &amp; Shot game system to portray the battlefields of the early gunpowder period. Infantry is based on pike formations with varying numbers of attached musketeers. Other musketeers operate independently, useful for skirmishing but vulnerable to both infantry and cavalry. Shock power comes from heavy cavalry, armored horsemen armed with pistol and sword, but relying increasingly on firepower to wear down opponents. Light cavalry roam the battlefield, too weak to stand up to their heavy cousins, but ruthless during a pursuit. The newest form of horsemen are the dragoons, men trained to fight mounted and on foot, ideal for seizing key points in advance of the main body. Artillery is still in its infancy; the large, powerful guns are all-but-immobile. However, different armies at different times experiment with lighter, more mobile weapons.&#10;&#10;Game Contents:&#10;&bull;    17 x 22&rdquo; map&#10;&bull;    140 die-cut counters&#10;&bull;    One Standard Rules booklet for this series&#10;&bull;    One Exclusive Rules booklet for this title&#10;&#10;",

You and your fellow monkeys jump in the bumper cars and away you go. You have no idea why there is fruit all over the arena floor, but you aim to grab as much of it for yourself as possible!&#10;&#10;Game synopsis:&#10;&#10;Spin Monkeys has each player starting on a junction at the edge of the board with a hand of 5 cards.  The cards have 8 possible degrees of rotation from 45 to a full 360 degrees.  On each turn players choose a card, rotate their monkey clockwise to the degree, then move one junction per played card in front of them.  On the first turn you only go one junction, but as the game goes you can travel more junctions as you play more cards, picking up all the fruit you glide over, apples, oranges and bananas, leaving peels. Some cards have text that let you do special actions, like taking more fruit, or rotating during your movement.  As you go faster, traveling more junctions per turn, it becomes harder to avoid running into the sides of the board or other monkeys.  When you bump into the side of the board you lose cards, slowing you down.  If you crash into another monkey you get to spin them, and steal a piece of fruit.  After you play your hand, you get 5 new cards to direct your monkey with. Game goes until only one kind of fruit is left on the board. Most points in fruit wins!&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Dragonfire was an attempt by Target/Heartbreaker to entice young adults into roleplaying, by means of devising a crossover between a roleplaying game and a fantasy miniatures boardgame similar to Milton Bradley and Games Workshop with their Hero Quest game system. This boxed game consists of 16 miniatures, various room and corridor tiles, cardboard doors with stand-ups, and some dungeon dressings represented by die cut cardboard pieces. The aim is to complete the task of each scenario given in the scenario booklet. One player is the Dungeon Master and sets up the rooms and monsters within when the other players reach them; the instructions are very specific about how to place the monsters, traps or items they encounter. Players are cooperative and do not compete against each other. Of course the players won't see the adventure booklet in advance or during the game, only the game master. All the players are knights of different colors (red, blue, green, and yellow). The same four colors are used for the plastic miniatures of: 4 orcs with bows, 4 trolls with clubs, and 4 Dragon Lords with swords.&#10;&#10;Between each scenario may the players increase their rank, depending on how many points they have collected during the scenario. They get points depending on which monsters they have killed plus one extra for a successfully done scenario. In the Dungeons are there monsters, traps, magic items and other stuff. Overall, the designers do a decent job of making the scenarios entertaining given a limited amount material in the game. Each turn, a new event card is overturned and strange things take place. This is fun at first but becomes predictable in later games.&#10;&#10;The dicing and combat system uses colored dice with different probabilities of scoring a hit - similar to Heroquest's Skulls and shields except that they are just circles on the dice and represent more of a yes/no answer when rolling. The game is slightly more advanced than Heroquest in that players can advance in levels similar to dungeons and dragons. As you increase in levels, you switch color of dice when attacking and defending, thus increasing your chances to score a &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;hit&quot; result on the dice. Otherwise the game is very similar to HeroQuest in general.&#10;&#10;Heartbreaker Hobbies produced a couple of lead elf miniatures designed for use with Dragonfire. At the same time, they put out a rare poster/magazine called &quot;Symmetry&quot; #1 that included two new magic items for the game, stats for two elf characters, and a short scenario using all of this with the Dragonfire game. One would assume that consumer response was lacking given that no attention was given to the Dragonfire game in later issues of Symmetry and the game went into obscurity. Still, the game could be used for a couple of night's gaming, especially if introducing children to D&amp;D style gaming or if one wanted to pirate the minis and room pieces to use with other game systems.&#10;&#10;",
