Four cards are dealt face up to form Society Row.&#10;&#10;The player chooses 3 of these cards to place below in their Royal Court as starting cards. The cards may be placed in any of the 4 spaces in either of the 2 rows forming the Royal Court. If any Daemon Prince cards are drawn, they are set aside and will be shuffled back into the deck after the player chooses the three they want (dealing out replacement cards to Society Row). The player also begins the game with 10 copper pieces (CP). These starting cards will not have their powers activated during the Game Setup.&#10;&#10;Play:&#10;A game turn consists of three phases:&#10;&#10;Phase 1A. The player may purchase 1 card from Society Row and place in the Royal Court OR they may skip this phase and go to Phase 1B.&#10;&#10;If the player purchases a card, any cards to the left of the gap slide to the right and a new card is drawn and placed in Society Row.&#10;&#10;Cards will be purchased during the game from this row in an auction format.&#10;&#10;Phase 1B. If the player does not wish to purchase any cards, the rightmost, non-Daemon Prince card is discarded and all remaining cards slide to the right and a new card is drawn and placed in Society Row. The player then receives 1CP and an additional 1CP for each Tax Collector in the Royal Court.&#10;&#10;Phase 2. The player may now use the combined strength of their Generals to combat one Daemon Prince. If the player has 3 or more Generals in the Royal Court representing each of the three clan icons, the player adds +2 to the total strength to the Generals. To defeat one Daemon Prince during this phase, the total of all Generals&rsquo; strengths must be equal to or greater than the Daemon Prince&rsquo;s strength (as shown by the black number). The player may additionally pay CP to add 1CP/1 Strength to this total. The defeated Daemon Prince is placed to the left of the draw deck, any cards to the left of the gap slide to the right and a new card is drawn and placed in Society Row. The player gains VP as listed on the Daemon Prince card.&#10;&#10;Phase 3. If Daemon Princes remain in Society Row, the rightmost non-Daemon Prince card is removed from the Society Row and placed in the Court of the Daemon Princes. All remaining cards slide to the right and a new card is drawn and placed in Society Row.&#10;&#10;Game End:&#10;The game will end after Phase 3 if either:&#10;4 Daemon Princes are in the Society Row or all 9 Daemon Princes have been drawn.&#10;&#10;The player then adds up the total VP gained during the game and additionally gains 1VP for every 3CP they have left. Each card in the Daemon Prince pile subtracts its listed VP from the player&rsquo;s VP score.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Hoping to bring a decisive conclusion along the Western Front despite the mud-and misery-filled trench deadlock, German General von Falkenhayn launched an attack from which the French could not retreat, and would prove costly for them to defend. The goal of the German offensive was the historic and symbolic city of Verdun.&#10;&#10;The German attack used new weapons such as poison gas, fighter airplanes to clear the skies of enemy observation planes, and a massive collection of artillery to devastate the defenders and obliterate the extensive French fortifications. The offensive was meant to inflict staggering casualties upon the defenders that would compel the Allies to negotiate. In the end, the Germans also suffered casualties that ran to the hundreds of thousands, making Verdun a symbol of war's inhumanity as well as tragic sacrifice.&#10;&#10;Designed by Roger Nord, Verdun: A Generation Lost is based on the same design as his other WWI game which appeared in Against the Odds magazine #11, The Big Push: The Battle for the Somme. Verdun: A Generation Lost features a 22&quot; by 34&quot; map that, like The Big Push, uses squares to regulate the game's functions, 264 large counters, and approximately 20 pages of rules and charts. Rules cover artillery, defensive fire, and close assault attacks, various types of weaponry, and there are six smaller scenarios covering pivotal aspects of the battle.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "As the guns of August were heard firing across Europe, the German Kaiserliche Marine began commerce raiding in the Pacific, targeting British shipping and colonial holdings to reduce their economic ability to fight on the continent. The Empire of Japan, eager to emerge as a global power and seeing an opportunity to expand at the expense of Germany's Asian and Pacific colonies, entered the Great War alongside their British allies.&#10;&#10;John Gorkowski's Empire at Sunrise: The Great War in Asia, 1914 depicts the struggle for control of Pacific sea lanes during the opening months of World War I. Its focus is largely on naval operations - on the cat-and-mouse dance of destroyers and battleships. The game presents its action at three different telescoping scales using nested playing surfaces, representing the area around Tsingtao at six miles per hex, the fight over the Asian Pacific at 240 miles per hex, and the entire Pacific Ocean at 1440 miles per zone. From the Battle of Coronel off the coast of Chile to the Siege of Tsingtao in China, this game elegantly captures the sweep of a forgotten chapter in the history of World War I.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "New from the father of VPG's Napoleonic 20 series, renowned game designer Joseph Miranda, the von Clausewitz series brings you the great campaigns of what historians call &quot;The Long 19th Century&quot; -- that period between the French Revolution and World War 1. The series seeks to faithfully demonstrate how war was thought about and waged during this epoch. It features quick, streamlined gameplay, simple but not simplistic mechanics, card play, and the fog of war.&#10;&#10;Unique to the series, and following the theories of Clausewitz himself, players must be aware that many of their actions will build Friction Points -- which a wily opponent can then use against them to sabotage their best laid plans. Careful management of reserves and reinforcements, clever card play, and knowing when to throw caution to the wind to strike at an opponent will win the day.&#10;&#10;The first game in the von Clausewitz series is Franco-Prussian War 40. Two continental heavyweights duel for supremacy in the conflict that smashed the French Second Empire, triggered the Paris Commune, and birthed the German Reich, with fateful consequences for Europe and the world. The German player must strike fast while holding the advantage in numbers, careful not to overextend his forces and put his tenuous supply lines at risk. The French player must seek to hold off the initial German invasion and defend Paris until he can unleash the Republican forces of the Third Republic. Will the war end in the streets of Paris, or Berlin? The fate of Europe hangs in the the balance!&#10;&#10;Game Data:&#10;&#10;Complexity: 5.5 on a 9 scale&#10;Solitaire Suitability: 4 on a 9 scale&#10;Scale: Each unit represents an army, or corps (approximately 20,000-60,000 men and their equipment). Each space on the map is approximately 30 kilometers across. Each turn represents a half month of operations.&#10;&#10;",

At night, sitting around the fire, they ate troll meals, told old troll legends, and played traditional troll games. Alas ! this golden age is past. Everything has changed for the worse since aliens, jealous of the troll wealth and culture, have settled in. The Trollland is now infested with Men, who ate cooked meat, Elves with dubious habits, Gobs who played barbarian music and hardworking Dwarves who steal the trolls jobs. As a result, Trollland is now in full decadence.&#10;&#10;The Troll king has decided to set it straight and put things back in order. As a troll governor, your mission is to arrest and send back home, in carriages or in dragon charters, as many unwanted aliens as possible. The trick of the game is that each charter scores point only for the player who placed the last alien in it. At the end of the game, the winner will be rewarded by the troll king and promoted as minister of national hideousity.&#10;&#10;Trollland&rsquo;s theme is in no way tacky, nasty or vulgar. It&rsquo;s the policy the game is rightly mocking which is tacky, nasty and vulgar.&#10;&#10;As for the game systems, Trollland (with three ls) is a very good filler card game . It&rsquo;s light, nasty and clever, in the line of many German style card games such as Coloretto, Mow or Take 5.&#10;&#10;",

Setbacks are coming your way: forest fires that drive away the animals, severe thunderstorms, extreme heat, a flat tire, a herd of hippos in the middle of the road and too little fuel or food are all factors that make it difficult to find the animals.

    "description": "Bibliogamo is a solitaire game of book production and libraries. In this game you will play the role of a publisher in the city of Bibliogamo. Using cards to hire artisans, you will put them to work in six city tower workshops, each devoted to a different kind of book. The Chief Librarian of the City will, in turn, tour the city buying books at what he considers their proper value. Prestige Collection cards generate victory points depending on how well you can fulfill the requirements of the Chief Librarian&rsquo;s collection.&#10;&#10;Needed to play: the game board showing the city of Bibliogamo, the 47 Artisan cards, the 7 Prestige Collection cards, 26 black eurocubes representing your Artisans, and 16 red eurocubes to act as track markers in the game. Additionally you&rsquo;ll need one pawn to represent the Librarian.&#10;&#10;Win: The game is over when the Time Track eurocube reaches [40] and you complete your turn. For each book you produce, you gain 1VP. For each 5 Florins you have, you gain 1 VP. Prestige VP is awarded as indicated on the Prestige Collection card chosen at the start of the game. Your total VP is your score for the game.&#10;&#10;The Five Turn Phases:&#10;1. Move the time track eurocube forward one day closer to [40].&#10;&#10;2. Move the Librarian Pawn clockwise 3 spaces, then turn over the top Artisan card from the draw pile on to the discard pile and move the Librarian accordingly as indicated by the Librarian icon on the left-hand side of the card.&#10;&#10;3. Look at the small Artisan icon below the Librarian icon on this same card. You may not play any card with that Artisan symbol on it this turn unless you discard a card from your hand with a matching small Artisan icon.&#10;&#10;4. You may now do any of the following, but in order:&#10;a. Pay 1 Florin to move the Librarian forward or backward one space. You may pay 1 Florin for each space you wish to move the Librarian.&#10;b. Sell a book, if completed, in the Tower the Librarian is currently standing on. Turn over the next 2 Artisan cards from the draw deck. Place the second card to the right of the first and look at the florin value on the second card as indicated by the Florin icon at on the first card. This is the amount the Librarian is willing to pay for this book. You may pay extra 1 day of time to turn over another card replacing the current Florin amount. You may continue to do this, paying 1 day of time per card turned over, until you are satisfied with the price.     &#10;Mark this amount on your Florin Track and return all Artisan eurocubes from the completed book to your pool. Then mark the production of a book on your Book track, moving the red eurocube forward one space, and if the book is one of those needed for a Prestige Collection, mark that book on the Prestige Collection card as well with a red eurocube. Note: you may pay extra days of time only if they remain on the Time Track. Lastly, place all drawn cards used to calculate the Florin value on the discard pile.&#10;c. Discard one Artisan card from your hand to the discard pile and place that number of black eurocubes on the Artisans indicated by the card, on any one Tower. Then discard one more card from your hand to pay for those Artisans. You may do this action twice if you wish. You do not receive any surplus Artisans from the discarded card. Nor do you receive any surplus Artisans if your tower already has the number required for that Artisan type. The second time you do this action you may add Artisans to the same tower or a different one.&#10;&#10;5. Draw back to a hand of 5 cards. If the draw deck is exhausted, shuffle the discard cards for a new draw deck.&#10;&#10;",

Equipment is a set of cards each showing one letter and a point value (there are also wild cards).&#10;&#10;You have a hand of up to 10 cards (you can draw as many as you like until you reach 10 - you start with 5). On your turn, you play a word to the table, with as many cards as you like face down. You announce the word, and everyone gets a chance to doubt you. You then show all the cards - if no one doubted you, you get the points for what you played (which could be QXZV, for a huge number of points). If someone did, you score if you were honest, with a bonus for each doubter. If you lied, the doubters get a bonus. You also get a bonus depending on your hand size and how many cards you played.&#10;&#10;",

You know time won't be enough and there will be things left unsaid. How do you make the most of this last instant together?&#10;&#10;When no story cards remain, it's time to say goodbye. There's no more time for stories. The person leaving says the words on the Goodbye card, then gets up and leaves. After a short break, get back together. Reveal the cards left on your hands. Those are the things left unsaid. Look at them together one by one, and silently reflect on their meaning, on how you wish you had just a little more time together. If you both had the same amount of cards in your hands, you at least feel you were on the same page, and your final conversation was in sync, like the good old days.&#10;&#10;",

However as this is a light RPG and a light Drinking Game there is a one chug per quest maximum which prevents Drinking Quest from being a &quot;Pass out in 10 minutes&quot; kind of drinking game. Over the course of 2 or 3 hours, a typical game averages 2 or 3 chugs.&#10;&#10;Whoever gets the most XP wins! Whoever loses had to chug the most so it's sort of like everybody wins.&#10;&#10;",

In each turn one player is selected as the Master of Ceremonies who secretly chooses between 15 and 20 tokens mixing different elements to create a unique pattern which he then tosses in the table to give everyone 5 seconds to see and remember. Each player will register on his Elemental Counter the amount of each of the four natural elements (water, fire, earth and air) that are present on the table. Then the players scores according to how near their guess was. But, its not as simple as it looks! Some tokens combine the elements in random ways and also if your guess is too high you score 0!&#10;&#10;&#10;Desde el inicio de los tiempos los cuatro elementos realizan una danza constante, de lejos pareciera ser una lucha.

    "description": "Each Anno Domini set consists of 336 cards, with a description of a historical event on one side of the card, and the year (and sometimes specific date) in which it happened on the other. Each player receives nine of these cards (or less, if you want the game to be shorter), and may only look at the descriptions. Players then put in turn a card on the table, *trying* to put theirs in chronological order. A player may, instead of adding a card, claim that the order in which the cards were put is incorrect. In this case all cards are turned over and the correct years revealed.  If the order was correct then the doubting player receives two cards and skips a turn. If the order was incorrect then the previous player, who accepted the order as correct, receives three cards. The first player that gets rid of all the cards wins.&#10;&#10;Bluffing is as least as important as knowledge in this game. Most events are rather obscure or are hard to date exactly, so this ain&rsquo;t no game for the nerds/geeks of this world, even they might think so, because it&rsquo;s full of surprises and pure fun. Highly recommended, because Anno Domini is a blast to play, is a very enjoyable social event and you even learn something from it.&#10;&#10;The set, for the Italian market, Penne e Pennelli contains historical events which are related to writing, printing, and art. Like all Anno Domini the Penne e Pennelli edition can be played as standalone or mixed with some or even all editions.&#10;&#10;Anno Domini the Penne e Pennelli is a functional merger of two previous set themes,  Kunst and Wort Schrift Buch.&#10;&#10;",

As characters progress through the dungeon levels, they grow in power and have more choices to make in how they play.&#10;&#10;Heroes &amp; Treasure is played on a modular board made up of large tiles, and each character and enemy is represented by stand-up pieces.&#10;&#10;",

However, as seen a few decades earlier during the Civil War, the US is able to rapidly ramp up their production capabilities and quickly expand the size of their army. As the game unfolds, the US receives production bonuses to reflect this. The geographical area represented by the US map is larger than in the other games, as such, each Martian Wave is made up of 5 Tripods, and they tend to move a little less often. To match this, the US must pay 3 PP to move Units during the Production step. The US game gives a more lumbering feel with large forces bashing against each other.&#10;&#10;",

Players then put in turn a card on the table, *trying* to put theirs in chronological order. A player may, instead of adding a card, claim that the order in which the cards were put is incorrect. In this case all cards are turned over and the correct years revealed.&#10;If the order was correct then the doubting player receives two cards and skips a turn. If the order was incorrect then the previous player, who accepted the order as correct, receives three cards. The first player that gets rid of all the cards wins.&#10;&#10;Bluffing is as least as important as knowledge in this game. Most events are rather obscure or are hard to date exactly, so this ain&rsquo;t no game for the nerds/geeks of this world, even they might think so, because it&rsquo;s full of surprises and pure fun. Highly Recommended, because Anno Domini is a blast to play, is a very enjoyable social event and you even learn something from it.&#10;&#10;Unfortunately there is no English edition in existence, but this game could be a good way, to improve your already existing German skills or a very good reason, to learn the German language in the first place.&#10;&#10;The Set &quot;Anno Domini - M&uuml;nzen&quot; contains historical events related to coins and money, can be played as a stand alone or together with the other sets, which is the best way of playing it.&#10;&#10;Part of the Anno Domini series&#10;&#10;",

In addition to sunbathing, you try to collect as many mangoes as possible, but take because some mangoes are more valuable than others. Only having the most points leads to victory.&#10;&#10;Sifaka is a tactical card game for up to four players, all of whom try to find the most valuable mangoes. By playing a card, the player activates his Sifaka, allowing him traveling through the desert. The movement speed and direction is determined by covering cards. If a player wants to move five fields, they must cover five palms; to change the direction, they need to cover an arrow. If you see a mango symbol mapped on the card, a corresponding mango token will be placed on it immediately. If a player stops their Sifaka on a field with a mango, they collect it immediately.&#10;&#10;Ones all the cards have been played, the game ends, and whoever has the most points on his mangoes wins.&#10;&#10;",

The gameplay is basically the same, but the rules have been revised and simplified for a more streamlined experience.&#10;&#10;The players assume the roles of adventurers with the ability to summon monsters. They delve into the dungeons, aiming to lay their hands on treasures and return safely, while hindering the progression of other players by summoning monsters into their ways.&#10;Of course, there is more hidden in the corners of the underground labyrinths! The heroes might encounter helpful characters, find powerful weapons and items, but they might stumble into traps and other nasty obstacles as well.&#10;&#10;Additional information: Monster Maker is a quite popular franchise in Japan, which became a considerably extensive fantasy universe over the years. It expanded into RPG, boardgames, collectible card games, videogames, novels, comics and manga as well.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "A clever racing game from Wolfgang Riedesser of Ave Caesar fame.  Players navigate flying dragons from North to South to reach the Golden Volcano.  You start with a set of wind stones marked N, S, O, W, SO, and SW (Ost is German for East).  You get a sloping rack in the shape of a dragon tail and at the start of the game pick the order for your wind stones on your rack, putting one stone underneath your own dragon at its starting position.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you draw the bottom stone from your rack, place it (in the wind direction indicated) next to a dragon on the board, your dragon or another player's, and move the dragon onto your stone.  The stone the dragon had been standing on goes to the top of your rack, to be used again when it rolls down eventually to the bottom.&#10;&#10;You make three moves per turn and try to put the other dragons into tough situations while making progress with your own.  So you generally want to play a North stone to move somebody else and the S, SO, and SW stones for your own dragon -- but there are blocks and corners, so this won't always be possible.&#10;&#10;The main strategic tip is to try to move the dragons that have been left standing on stones with southward movement so as to get the S stones onto your own rack.  You also have two Storm cards (to allow 5 moves instead of 3 on a turn) and two Lightning cards (to prevent another player trying to move your dragon) to deploy during the course of the game.&#10;&#10;Although the structural underpinnings and the slight benefit of memory might make you think you're going to have a serious, thinking game, Goldener Drache actually plays out as very light and take-thatty for a fun 15 minutes and &quot;Let's do it again!&quot;&#10;&#10;",
