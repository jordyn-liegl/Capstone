    "description": "REUTERS, 27 DECEMBER 2015&#10;After encircling the city for weeks, the Iraqi military launched a campaign to retake it last week and made a final push to seize the central administration complex on Sunday.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;By controlling the complex this means that we have defeated them in Ramadi,&rdquo; said Sabah al-Numani, a spokesman for the force leading the fight on the government side. &ldquo;The next step is to clear pockets that could exist here or there in the city.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;A U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the U.S.-led campaign against Islamic State was unable to confirm at this point whether the militants had been cleared out of the government complex.&#10;&#10;The Battle for Ramadi is a solitaire game that depicts the climatic seven days of the assault on this key town. You are the commander of the Iraqi Security Forces and must capture the Government Complex to secure the political victory, but your ultimate objective is to liberate the city and its inhabitants. You have elite Counter Terrorism Service troops supported by army, police and militia units. You can also call on Coalition air assets and special forces to give you the edge. Combat is brutal and unpredictable. The city is full of IEDs, ISIS fighters, and innocent civilians.&#10;&#10;You must plan carefully, take advantage of your freedom to deliver strikes against enemy territory at will, but also be warned that you can lose the game, even on the last turn, as your casualties mount and ISIS counterattack your exposed troops.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

In stock rounds, players auction the Private Companies and the Minor Companies. In operating rounds, the Privates pay a fixed income and the Minors lay track, earn revenues, and buy boats.&#10;&#10;In due course, the game enters the Railway Age. In stock rounds, players may buy shares in Public Companies (which start as 5-share). In operating rounds, Publics lay track, place station markers, earn revenues, and buy trains. If they have reached their destination, they may grow into a 10-share company. Minors become fixed-income like Privates, and may be acquired by Publics.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a Public share price exceeds a certain value. The player with the highest worth (cash + shares) wins.&#10;&#10;",

The starting player leads a card or set of cards with the same value &mdash; but they can play multiple cards only if the cards are adjacent to one another in their hand.

    "description": "Politics is always a risky business, but in the Wild West, where even the smallest slight could call for blood, being a politician was a particularly dangerous career choice.&#10;&#10;In Outlaws: Last Man Standing, you take on the role of a Governor in the Far West seeking to best his rivals by any means necessary. With the help of your supporters, keep your Governor safe as you seek to outmaneuver your opponent in this card-based game of bluff and deduction.&#10;&#10;Each player controls a set of 10 cards representing the Governor&rsquo;s constituents (or unscrupulous individuals in it for the gold), each with a different ability. These characters are lined up facing one another, their identities hidden from their opponent. During the game, the characters will move up and down the table, revealing their identity to collect tokens and use their abilities.&#10;&#10;Players must cleverly manage the information that they obtain and reveal, baiting and trapping their opponent to accomplish one of the three win conditions. The first player to do so will attain the power and glory of the White House, leaving his opponent with only the taste of bitter defeat.&#10;&#10;There are three ways to win the game:&#10;&#10;&#10;    The &quot;Good&quot; way: Win the election fair and square. Some of the facedown tokens are &quot;votes&quot; that you can use to get your Governor elected. If you have more votes than your opponent, then you can use your Governor to start an election and win the game.&#10;    The &quot;Bad&quot; way: If you can find your opponent&rsquo;s Governor and assassinate him with your Hitman, you can win the election by default. A dead man can&rsquo;t be President, it&rsquo;s as simple as that.&#10;    The &quot;Ugly&quot; Way: If you suspect that your opponent is after your Governor, you can attempt to arrest them with your Sheriff. If a Sheriff can foil an assassination attempt and arrest the Hitman, his employer&rsquo;s reputation will be left in tatters. A scandal will destroy a man just as surely as a bullet... &#10;&#10;&#10;Your objective is to hide your Governor amongst your other cards whilst you search for a way to win the game. You and your opponent will be able to look at each other&rsquo;s cards, move them around, and even lock some of them up! You&rsquo;ll need to use as much deception and bluff as you can to win because, whether it be by silver or lead, only one of you will make it out of this unscathed!&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "(from Legion Wargames website)&#10;&#10;The Battle of Blenheim is a tactical level two player game covering one of the pivotal battles during the War of Spanish Succession. One player takes the role of Marlborough, commanding the British and Allied forces, and the other of Tallard, leading the Franco-Bavarians.  At Blenheim Marlborough found himself confronting a superior Franco-Bavarian force in a strong defensive position. Like Hannibal's great victory at Cannae, Blenheim was won by the successful implementation of a bold and imaginative plan. The flanks of the Franco-Bavarian forces were pinned by furious attacks at unfavourable odds which denuded their centre of troops re-deployed to buttress the hard-pressed wings. Then Marlborough released his cavalry to smash what was left of Franco-Bavarian centre and cleave Tallard's army into two. The threat that Louis XIV's France would come to dominate Europe was over.&#10;&#10;The Seven Hex System (SHS) derives its name from the map which is divided into areas comprised of seven hexes which enables the player to adopt various positions within an area to reflect different tactical formations thereby making it more likely that an attack will succeed or defending units will stand firm.   The SHS incorporates several unique features intended to replicate in a simple and intuitive way the options available to a commander (the wargamer) of a large army.  So whilst the commander has complete freedom to devise a plan, and a good deal when positioning units which have yet to encounter the enemy, once battle is joined the options become increasingly limited and unforeseen events can play a part in determining the outcome of events but the commander can still influence these at a tactical level. The key to success is a sound plan with a margin for error which allows for ill-fortune, the shrewd deployment of units so as to be able to implement that plan, and the timely commitment of reserves.&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;&#10;    22&quot; x 34&quot; Game Map&#10;    176 - EasyPunch 6/10&quot; Counters&#10;    16 pages Game Rules&#10;    3 Charts Player Aids&#10;&#10;&#10;",

These entertaining contests require strategy, intuition, and nerve to determine who survives and who doesn't.&#10;   &#10;This is an auction bidding game. Each round, the lead off player flips over a card from the deck which will then be auctioned off. There are also Hidden Resource cards in the deck. When one comes up, players bid for the next card in the deck without knowing what it is!  Each player has 6 bid markers: 3 Pass, 2 Stop, and 1 Strike. Each round of each auction, a player must place one of these markers face down. The first round, the markers are placed in the '5 position'. This means if the auction is stopped at this position, the winner pays 5 for the item. If no one stops the auction, players place a marker in the '4 position'. Once again, if the auction is stopped, the winner pays 4 for the item. These rounds continue until the auction is stopped, or until the auction moved to the last '0 position'. Once the auction for that item is complete, the deck passes to the next player. Each time the deck comes to a player, he collects income as listed on each item card he owns. He may then choose to place an item sold back to the bank up for auction, or draw one from the deck to be auctioned. One thing that makes Shipwrecked stand out from other auction games is that you can't 'not bid'. You must participate in the auction, even if you really don't want the item.&#10;&#10;",

It is also the first one to be actually printed,&#10;&#10;A previous sort of &quot;beta&quot; edition was just sold as a .pdf and as an expansion for the Force on Force basic game. Extended playtesting and feedback has permitted the developing of a stand-alone game.&#10;&#10;From the Introduction in the book:&#10;&#10;Tomorrow&rsquo;s War is a science fiction military miniature wargame with emphasis on &quot;hard&quot; science fiction rather than &quot;Space Opera&quot; or &quot;Science Fantasy.&quot; This rule book contains background material for gaming in Ambush Alley's campaign setting, but the rules themselves are not background dependent. You can use them to game gritty science fiction engagements against whatever narrative backdrop you choose.&#10;&#10;Tomorrow&rsquo;s War can be played with figures of any scale.&#10;&#10;",

Players assume the roles of provincial governors, competing to have their respective regions chosen as the Queen's new capital. To secure victory in this contest, they must utilize all their resources and seek assistance whenever possible.&#10;&#10;However, this journey will not be without obstacles, as remnants of the old regime still lurk in the shadows, plotting an uprising.&#10;&#10;The core game loop of The Queen's New Capital is quite simple: Players draw six cards and play four cards each round. These action cards enable players to construct structures (the primary source of points in the game), recruit leaders with passive abilities, acquire more powerful action cards, and contribute to the kingdom's Political and Warfare crises.&#10;&#10;The winner will be the first player to obtain eight Recognition Seals, which are bestowed upon reaching five points in each of the four Province Status tracks: Might, Morale, Influence, and Wealth.&#10;&#10;The Queen's New Capital is a strategic game that immerses players in the difficult decisions faced by leaders when overseeing a community's ascent. Going all-in on dazzling new infrastructure may attract thieves and political dissidents, while dedicating all resources to safeguarding the frontiers can impede innovation and development. Striking a balance and establishing a swift engine is the key to achieving victory.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "In Grand Slam, originally titled Love Means Nothing, each player has a deck of 24 cards, each of which depicts two parts of a tennis court: One half-court can be used for defense, returning a ball that comes your way; the other half-court can be used for offense, sending a shot across the net. You never use both halves of the card at once &mdash; either one or the other.&#10;&#10;A turn consists of first playing a card to cover the shot your opponent played, then playing another card to dictate which of the six zones you'll hit the ball to. Finally, you play a preparation card, indicating which zones you're prepared to cover. The preparation card can be used to cover a shot if the appropriate zone is highlighted; otherwise you must cover the shot with a card from your hand, in which case the preparation card becomes the attack. Thus, by playing cards that your opponent cannot cover with her preparation card, you maintain control of the match because you'll see from where the next attack will come and will be able to prepare for that. Of course if a player cannot cover a shot at all, then the point is lost.&#10;&#10;Combinations of cards can create special shots, which if not covered by the corresponding combination of cards, leave a player off balance, with her drawing only one card at the end of the turn instead of the usual two. This will leave her with fewer options and make it less likely that she'll cover your shots.&#10;&#10;",

All told, more than 1000 tanks will face off over the course of three weeks and on a front of nearly 140 km! &#10;On 6 October 1944 the southern pincer of the 2nd Ukrainian Front attacks the forces of Army Group South around Arad and breaks the 3rd Hungarian Army. In 24 hours, the spearhead of the attack, the Cavalry Mechanized Group under Pliev, advances more than 50 km. The northern pincer &ndash; 6th Armoured Guards Army &ndash; throws itself full force against the counter attacks of the 1st and 23rd Panzer around Nagyvarad and cannot break through to the Hungarian plain. &#10;Redirecting Pliev&rsquo;s group toward the northeast, Malinovski hopes to make a pincer attack on Nagyvarad&rsquo;s defenders and open up the route toward Debrecen,  Ny&iacute;regyh&aacute;za and Tokaj, cut Army Group South in two and isolate the 8th Army, retreating before the 4th Ukrainian Front.&#10;On 9 October the southwestern barrier of Debrecen falls but the Germans engage reinforcements and launch two divisions, a Panzer and a Panzer Grenadier division, supported by a Tiger II battalion  &ndash; Operation Zigeuner Baron &ndash; at the flank of the Soviet penetration on 19 October.&#10;Debrecen finally falls on 20 October, Ny&iacute;regyh&aacute;za the 22nd, thereby isolating the 8th Army&hellip; &#10;Is it all over ? No &ndash; taking advantage of the advanced position of Pliev&rsquo;s cavalry corps, the Germans launch an assault with the units of the 8th Army and the Panzer in order to reopen the Soviet trap and destroy the mobile group.&#10;As the Soviet, will you be able to best use your powerful armoured forces to surround the enemy, and as a member of the Axis can you save the 8th Army and protect the outskirts of Budapest ?&#10;&#10;Game scale: &#10;A game turn represents two days of real time. &#10;One hex covers approximately 5 km. &#10;The units represent divisions, brigades, regiments, KGs, battalions or HQs, with their organic elements.&#10;&#10;",

From the Japanese invasion of China in 1937 to the end of the war, the entire conflict is portrayed.&#10;&#10;Like AETO, the forces in APTO are exactingly accurate and have been exhaustively researched. There's no guesswork; every piece is based on the most thorough study ever devoted to a wargame. It even features all the Soviet and Japanese forces that engaged in the Nomonhan Incident, along with the units of every nationality that fielded a military in the war. Indeed, this is actually a division-level game, and is even more detailed than the acclaimed AETO.&#10;&#10;APTO and AETO can be linked to simulate the entire Second World War more accurately than any other game ever produced. This is more than an AETO supplement; though, in that it features special rules for: elite pilots, atomic bombs, midget submarines, coast-watchers, tropical disease and more.&#10;&#10;Advanced PTO is the most realistic yet playable game on the subject; it includes admirals and generals, every type of aircraft and every capital ship that existed in the Pacific Theater, and even some refits. APTO represents the ultimate blend of playability and detail. In conjunction with AETO and also Africa Orientale Italiana (the East African expansion), no World War II strategic series has ever been so all-encompassing, detailed, playable and realistic.&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;&#10;1,680 Die cut counters &#10;    2 34&quot; x 22&quot;  Map &#10;    2 Rule booklets &amp; 1 Scenario  booklet &#10;      Player Aid cards &amp;  display &#10;    3 Dice &#10;      Storage bags&#10;&#10;",

Exiled from a once glorious city, tribes of scavengers are all that remains of a scientifically advanced humanity.&#10;&#10;As the regular offering to the gods was delayed, the ground split open and vile Beasts arose from the Abyss, relentlessly attacking everyone in their path. Driven out of their home and left for dead in the harsh desert, the people have lost all hope, until an unexpected discovery was made.&#10;&#10;Turris is a competitive Worker Placement game where players attempt to build the Tower as a final defense mechanism, utilizing the prehistoric technology of divine origin. You assign your Scouts to acquire resources and decipher the data from ancient machinery, all the while being constantly chased (and often devoured) by the unstoppable Beasts. The tribes all follow the Council's directives and complete its missions, but as a tribe leader you know that once the Tower is built and humanity is saved, it will dissolve without strong leadership. In building the Tower, you acquire Prestige Points which represent your standing amongst the tribes. The leader with the most Prestige will take control of the Council and lead humanity into the future &mdash; whatever it may be.&#10;&#10;Turris uses miniatures that represent the Beasts and Scouts, decks of Mission and Tactics cards, as well as Tarot-sized gold/silver lined Trionfi cards which represent the Tower rooms.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Originally created as a treatise on Whist published around 1742, later editions incorporated additional games. By the 10th edition, published in 1750, the book included chapters on Quadrille, Piquet, Chess and Back-Gammon. At least 20 different versions of Hoyle's have been published over the years, making it the best-selling series of books about games in history and giving rise to the popular phrase, according to Hoyle.&#10;&#10;The title page of an edition published around 1900 reads as follows:&#10;&#10;&quot;Hoyle's Games. America's Complete Hand-Book of Games, containing all the card games played in the United States, with their rules, regulations, technicalities, etc., adapted to the American mode of playing, from the text of Hoyle, and the best modern authorities. Also comprising Backgammon, Chess, Checkers, Billiards, Pool, Bagatelle, Bowls, etc., with numerous diagrams and engravings. Complete edition. Revised, corrected, and enlarged.&quot;&#10;&#10;One confusing aspect about this book is that there is no trademark on the name Hoyle (just like there is no trademark on the name Webster's for dictionaries), so referring to a book as Hoyle's Games could refer to a number of different volumes.  The popular Hoyle's Games was first published in 1907, with at least ten editions published in the twentieth century.  Each edition added to, edited, and clarified what had been presented in the earlier edition.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "In the distant past the Vikings came upon a great, hidden and uninhabited island, its verdant lands rich in resources. The Vikings hid the island&rsquo;s location from the rest of the known world, killing all those who stumbled upon it. Soon after, many great clans established settlements across the island. Then the true master of the island revealed himself: Deep below the earth&rsquo;s surface lay Ymir, the powerful Jotunn of old, slumbering since time began. Sensing the Vikings&rsquo; trespass, the giant awoke enraged and emerged a juggernaut of destruction as he rampaged across the island.&#10;&#10;Sk&aacute;lds from the various settlements soon discovered how to control Ymir in a limited way. Though the Jotunn was weak of mind, he was strong in will and his appetite for destruction unquenchable. Consumed with greed, rival Sk&aacute;lds turned the lumbering colossus against their enemies in a race to conquer the island and seize the riches of the other settlements.&#10;&#10;Rampaging Jotunn is a competitive fast paced board game for 2 players in which each both players create the island they will be playing on where they will populate it with opposing villages and armies.  Each player controls an army of Vikings trying to protect their villages while trying to destroy their opponents villages, at the same time the Jotunn rampages across the island destroying everything in sight.&#10;&#10;Players use cards to influence the giant and direct him towards your opponents armies and villages.  They also use cards to move their armies into battle across the island. The last player with villages on the board wins!  Rampaging Jotunn is a half hour long game and is for players 8 and up!&#10;&#10;Rampaging Jotunn features illustrations by the award winning artist, Nicolas Giancondino.&#10;&#10;",

The main difference is you can attack other players with your armies to gain land.&#10;&#10;The players take the roles of daimyos - local warlords - during &quot;Sengoku jidai&quot; (warring states period in Japanese history). While holding a balance between fighting the other warlords and control of their own realm, the players strive to become the most powerful warlord under the heavens of Japan. Are you going to use your resources to build castles, armies or cannons? Or do you establish a town of fine arts?  Famous generals from the Sengoku jidai period will have an appearance, with the only slight difference being that they appear as cute girls.&#10;&#10;Integrates with:&#10;&#10;    Kunitori!

    "description": "Operation Shoestring: The Guadalcanal Campaign, 1942, is an Operational level board-wargame covering the air, land, and sea battles between the United States Army, Navy, and Marine Corps and the forces of the Japanese Empire on and around Guadalcanal Island in 1942. The unit scale is company-level for the ground game and squadron-level for the air forces. Naval counters represent one ship for carriers and battleships, two ships for cruisers, and destroyer flotillas.&#10;&#10;&quot;We struck at Guadalcanal to halt the advance of the Japanese. We did not know how strong he was, nor did we know his plans. We knew only that he was moving down the island chain and that he had to be stopped ... From that moment in 1942, the tide turned, and the Japanese never again advanced.&quot; -- Maj. Gen. Alexander A. Vandegrift, USMC, Commanding General, 1st Marine Division&#10;&#10;The strategic situation at the time found both sides relatively equal in strength for one of the few times in the war. After the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor and the ensuing string of rapid conquests, Japanese fortunes had taken a turn for the worse. At the Battle of Coral Sea, American carrier-based air power fought to a draw with the vaunted Japanese, serving notice that the Japanese would not be allowed to project naval power with impunity. Later, the Battle of Midway saw four Japanese carriers sunk, evening the odds in the Pacific and laying the groundwork for the first American offensive of the Pacific War.&#10;&#10;The Japanese, having been blunted at Midway, turned their attention to the south, extending a siring of bases southeast through the Solomons chain. They established a seaplane base at Tulagi, and began construction of a large airfield on the island of Guadalcanal. Air pow- er based at these airfields would be able to effectively threaten American supply lines between the west coast and Australia. Shocked by the news of the Japanese airfield construction in the Solomons, the American high command gathered all available marine forces for a strike at Guadalcanal. The main force was the American First Marine Division assembled at Wellington, New Zealand. This Division, understrength and less than half trained, would bear the brunt of driving the Japanese from Guadalcanal.&#10;&#10;As the morning of August 7, 1942 dawned, weeks of boredom for the Marines and occasional skirmishes for the air forces were replaced by real battle. The Marines went ashore, first at Tulagi, then Guadalcanal, and finally at Gavutu/Tanambago. The Japanese, caught unprepared by the audacious amphibious assaults, nevertheless recovered quickly and sent air, land, and naval forces to Guadalcanal. The resulting clashes shaped the future of the war in the Pacific.&#10;&#10;Operation Shoestring simulates this fascinating campaign &amp; includes special rules to simulate such unique aspects of the battle as: Innovative combat resolution, integrating maneuver combat, close assault, artillery bombardment, shore bombardment, air support, and even Banzai charges into one easy-to-use system. Full-featured naval and air game that integrates with the island fighting. Engineers to rebuild airfields and construct improved positions. Japanese hidden units and limited U.S. intelligence.&#10;&#10;Operation Shoestring can be played by one to four players. Solitaire play is possible with a slight modification to the naval rules, while team play is easily accommodated with one player commanding the ground forces and one the air and naval forces for each side. An introductory scenario, several short scenarios, and a grand campaign game allow players to experience the battle for Guadalcanal over a variety of time spans.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 3.5 days&#10;Hex: 1 mile / 1.6 kilometers&#10;Units: Battalion to Army&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 22 x 34&quot; full color map&#10;Three dual-side printed countersheets (600 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 24-page Operation Shoestring rulebook&#10;Six single-side printed player aid cards&#10;One 10-sided die&#10;One counter storage tray&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: High&#10;Complexity Level: High&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 1-30 depending on scenario&#10;&#10;",

On their turn, each player places one of their god&rsquo;s followers on one of the buildings in the village.  Each god has the same two types of followers: Tsukumogami (Spirit Objects), household items possessing a soul that animates them and Zashiki-warashi (Kid Ghosts), playful child-like spirits.   Each follower has a strength value and once a building has five followers placed on it, the total strengths of each god&rsquo;s followers placed there are then compared.  Spirit Objects have a number that represents their strength, while Kid Ghosts have strengths that can vary through powerful special abilities which are triggered by the arrangement of other spirits at the same building.  If the strength of your faction is greater, you place one of your god&rsquo;s possession markers on the building.  Using clever placement of your followers to better capitalize on each Zashiki-warashi&rsquo;s special ability is key to victory in Fan and Mallet.

Each time a player purchases a Monster or Horror card, that card goes into the play area - or &quot;Room&quot; - of the player to their left.&#10;&#10;Any Ally cards that a player purchases go into their own Room, where they help defend against the Monsters and Horrors that have been placed there by the others players.&#10;&#10;At the end of the turn, the Allies, Monsters, and Horrors in the player's Room battle it out! If the Monsters are able to overwhelm the player's Allies, then any excess damage lowers the player's Health. When a player is reduced to 0 Health, they are eliminated from the game. The last player left standing survives the night and claims victory!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

In addition, players may flee from the scene, betraying the others to win the game on their own or be turned into zombies themselves.&#10;&#10;Zombies have different abilities, like stealing a die from the players when in play. They all require different die values and numbers to be rolled to be discarded. Some will be attracted by players, who attack them, others ignore them and stay focused on the bus. Each zombie attacking a player reduces their capability to reroll by one. If this is decreased to zero, the player is turned into a Zombie him- or herself and will stay in front of the bus for the rest of the game, eliminated unless another player finds a cure. Whenever there are four or more zombies next to the bus at the end of a turn (including players turned into zombies), the players lose. So distracting zombies from the bus, is sometimes a necessity. In addition, player gain loot tokens, whenever a zombie is killed in front of them.&#10;&#10;However, the winning condition is not killing the zombies, but rescuing all cheerleaders from the bus. For this, rolling star symbols is required. Cheerleaders are tokens, placed in two stacks on the bus, each showing two to four stars. Only cheerleaders on top of a stack can be rescued any given time, rolling the corresponding numbers of stars. Some zombies make use of stars impossible, while they are in play.&#10;&#10;In addition to the stars and different symbols, required to kill the zombies, there is also a die face with half a bullseye. One die rolled on that side is worthless, but two could be used as a wild for any symbol to kill a zombie.&#10;&#10;Players also have a special character ability, e.g. one gets two loot tokens instead of one for a zombie killed in front of them, one can ignore the &quot;no star&quot; restriction of particular zombies, etc.&#10;&#10;",

Or Mialee in the Dungeon with the Staff of Power?&#10;&#10;In Clue: Dungeons &amp; Dragons, a group of heroic adventurers has been called to the Archmage's castle, but one of those heroes isn't who he appears to be; one of the heroes is a doppelganger, a monster that can look like anyone! In the darkest part of the night, the doppelganger kills the Archmage, triggering a spell that seals the castle until the monster is caught. Now, in the grand tradition of Clue, the six suspects must determine which one of them is the doppelganger: Regdar the Human Fighter, Tordek the Dwarf Fighter, Lidda the Halfling Rogue, Mialee the Elf Wizard, Ember the Human Monk or Nebin the Gnome Wizard. The heroes try to figure out Who killed the Archmage, Where the crime occurred, and Which magical weapon was used.&#10;&#10;For the most part, gameplay in Clue: Dungeons &amp; Dragons is identical to standard Clue as players roll a die, move into different locations on the game board, then make accusations against a particular combination of who/where/which cards and a particular opponent; if that opponent holds one of those cards, she must reveal it to you. Eventually someone will narrow down the possibilities and make an accusation as to exactly which cards have been removed from the game; if correct the player wins, and otherwise she's out of the game and play continues for everyone else.&#10;&#10;One optional element in Clue: Dungeons &amp; Dragons is the Wandering Monsters deck. After landing on a &quot;claw-marked&quot; space on the game board, the player draws the top card from this deck, then battles the creature shown by rolling a die. If she wins, she gains a magic item that confers a single-use special ability, such as looking at a random card from an opponent's hand or taking an extra turn. If she loses, her token is placed in the center of the game board, from where it will take several turns to move back into a room (and get back into the game).&#10;&#10;",

The highest energy card revealed wins the wave, which is collected to be scored at the end of the game. However tied energy cards will cause surfers to wipe out, giving the next highest energy card surfer the win. &lsquo;Respect&rsquo; is the tiebreaker here, and a resource players can gain OR use to buy extra energy and surfboard (bonus point) cards from the beach when they win, or place second on each wave.&#10;&#10;The catch is that when you win and take a wave, the energy card you used is trashed (removed from the game), weakening your remaining energy, while the second place and other surfers discard their energy cards and may regain them later. So there is some advantage in coming second and strategically gaining more respect OR buying cards from the beach&hellip;&#10;&#10;Surfboards bought from the beach with respect add bonus victory points to some wave types, skewing the value of certain waves for some surfers as the game progresses. Temporary energy bought from the beach gives surfers an edge in later rounds. Bluebottle stingers sometimes blow into the breakzone, and players must avoid playing the lowest energy cards to escape their hidden sting (0 to -3 points on the underside of each chosen bluebottle token). Or bravely take a sting to save a playable card for the next wave! Players running low on energy can rest (pass) to gain 1 respect, and regain their previously discarded energy cards.&#10;&#10;The ideal play is to commit just enough energy to win a wave as efficiently as possible at the right time. And then carefully choose when you take more respect (max 4), or when to the beach and what you buy.&#10;&#10;The game end is triggered when either:&#10;&#10;1.

    "description": "&quot;Tarleton's Quarter!&quot; is a game about the British attempt to win the American Revolution by invading the Southern colonies, The game covers the period from the British landing in Georgia in 1778 to October of 1781 (the historical end of the siege of Yorktown and the surrender of Cornwallis' army). The object of British efforts in the South was to bring the four southern colonies - Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia-back under British sway after almost four years of uninterrupted Continental control. Ideally, the English wanted to &quot;restore civil government,&quot; i.e., to return the South to its status ante-bellum with British governors, taxes paid to the Crown, and no expensive garrison to enforce the situation.&#10;&#10;&quot;Tarleton's Quarter!&quot; highlights some salient aspects of the British campaign in the south. First and foremost was the effect of leadership, and the difficulty both sides had in finding leaders who were bold without being rash. Rarely did energy and sound judgment come in the same package. Another vital factor was the terrain of the southern colonies, or rather, one feature of it: water. The reason that water &mdash; in the form of rivers and swamps &mdash; is the dominant terrain feature is &mdash; surprise! &mdash; it rained a lot, particularly in the Carolinas. These facts &quot;on the ground&quot; raise the amount of non-combat losses, like those caused by disease, which made just keeping an army intact such a headache at the time. (There's nothing romantic about losing large numbers of men to something beyond a player's control.) As to why so many people lived in North and South Carolinas' pestilential swamps, it was because those swampy areas were precisely where rice and indigo grew best, and in the 18th century in the Carolinas, that was where the money was; cotton was a much later development.&#10;&#10;Perhaps the most important factor of all was the continuing British belief in an untapped reservoir of loyalist support in the south. Those in command of the British army knew they didn't have enough manpower to control even the southern half of the American colonies on their own. They were relying on the appearance of a &quot;silent majority&quot; of loyal, but previously suppressed, American subjects who would take control of those provinces swept of Continental forces. Appropriately, you are allowed to indulge in as much over-confidence as your red coat will allow.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Sneferu was an Egyptian pharaoh who reigned circa between 2543 and 2510 BC. He was the only pharaoh who had three  pyramids built. The first attempt to build a pyramid in Sneferu&rsquo;s lifetime was in Meidum, but the structure collapsed. The second attempt, which came to be known as the Bent Pyramid, had its original angle of inclination changed during construction, resulting in an unmistakable shape. Finally, there is the Red Pyramid. The first successful attempt at constructing a smooth-sided pyramid heralded a new era of pyramid building and became the precursor to the famed Pyramids of Giza.&#10;&#10;In the game, you become one of the Egyptian architects Sneferu called upon after two failed attempts. The pharaoh is wary of his inevitable demise and there is no room for error anymore. You must build a pyramid that will honor the great ruler. But only the pyramid that matches Sneferu&rsquo;s greatness shall be chosen as the pharaoh&rsquo;s final resting place. The builder of such a pyramid will be showered with gold and undying fame. And those who fail? They shall be trapped in the pyramids of their own making as they are torn down on top of their heads. Well&hellip; there is your motivation. So,  get building!&#10;&#10;Sneferu is a family-weight abstract game by Adam &Scaron;pan&#196;&#155;l (Project L) where players attempt to win the great pharaoh&rsquo; s favor by building the highest pyramid possible from mined blocks (with each block being a combination of two of the five possible materials). The players get these blocks by spending the two resources in the game: food and time. Time, represented by your boat moving forward on the Nile, is a finite resource with no way to gain more. The boats&rsquo; position on the river also determines player order: it is always the turn of the player who has used up the least time and is the furthest back on the Nile. Players can gain food by completing sections of their pyramids with matching materials.&#10;&#10;The blocks on offer change each round and it is up to the players to decide when is the best moment to invest a lot of time or food, or perhaps even pay extra for just the right block.&#10;&#10;Throughout the game, you will travel up the Nile, from Cairo all the way to the distant Nubian Desert , and then back down. Along the way, you will visit famous quarries providing gold, granite, limestone, white limestone, and basalt. Can you seize the best opportunities these quarries provide?&#10;&#10;The architect that builds the tallest pyramid wins! Or will you manage to build the entire pyramid in such a short time?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

A runway with sections A, B and C lies in front of all players.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player either discards 1-3 cards or takes an action. An action can be either playing a Delay card on an opponent's plane (which moves that plane back one space on the runway unless the opponent discards a Lucky Captain card) or playing a set of 1-3 cards of the same letter to advance one of the player's planes. If you play a single A, for example, you can place your small plane on the A section of the runway; if you play three As, you can place your large plane on the A. If you play three Cs, you can advance your large plane from B to C.&#10;&#10;To take off, you must play 1-3 D cards (depending on the size of the plane), then reveal the top weather card, which might show that one size of plane can't take off. If this size matches the plane trying to go airborne, then you discard the cards to no effect; otherwise, the plane leaves the runway and heads into the sky (a.k.a. the game box). A Lucky Captain card can represent any letter card when played.&#10;&#10;At the end of your turn, refill your hand to six cards.

Players must cooperate to defeat the king, but only one of them can take the crown thus backstabbing is always a concern.  The game is played through various decks of cards.  Players strive to gain prestige and influence points so that they can recruit characters to their side.  They also use natural disasters, plagues, interrogations, and other political problems against their opponents. Of 19 possible actions each turn, a player can only perform 2, thus creating a tension and need for strategy. Player interaction is very high because players can perform actions during opponent turns and because nobody is eliminated early from the game. A player who is killed just misses a turn and then returns as the former player's heir, usually with revenge in mind.&#10;&#10;",

Each player may only introduce two new villagers per turn across five or six turns total. Villagers start as farmers earning a fixed income. Part of that income may be spent to purchase trade licenses which allow your villagers to set up as traders. Traders earn an income based on the population of their village. Each village must also elect a representative to government each turn. These councilors move to town and have no income for that turn (so much for realism - there is no provision for special interest groups or political action committees!). The government must decide whether to tax the farmers, tax the traders, or revoke one type of trade license. When this session of government breaks up councilors can either pay their own way home or pay a small fee and remain in government for another turn (well, at least that sounds realistic!). Each turn a new marketplace is opened which doubles the income of the host village. The villages bid fiercely for the right to host the new market each turn. Finally, the villagers and traders earn income and pay their taxes. The player that has the most money after the last round of play inherits control of the lands of Keywood and wins the game.&#10;&#10;Keywood is Richard Breese's first game in the key series.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "From the Avalanche Press website:&#10;  &#10;Rome at War: Queen of the Celts&#10;&#10;In the year 43 AD, Roman legions splashed ashore in Kent, unopposed by the Britons led by Caractus, who had sworn to repel them. The Emperor Claudius had dispatched Aulus Plautius and 45,000 men to conquer the mist-covered island where Julius Caesar had failed almost a century earlier.&#10; Over the next 40 years, Roman would clash with Celt in a series of battles that neither realized would determine the future of Western civilization.  The Romans broke the Britons, whose furious courage could not match Roman discipline. The island would pass under Roman rule for the next several centuries, implanting a Latin-oriented culture and shoving Celtic ways to the very fringes of Europe. All that would remain were their legends; not least among them the fiery leadership of Boudicca, warrior-queen of the Iceni and resolute enemy of Rome.&#10;&#10;The Series: Rome at War (Avalanche Press) series covers Roman battles against both their neighbors and each other. The first game, Rome At War I: Hannibal at Bay, covered the last battles of Carthage&rsquo;s favorite son. The second, Rome at War II: Fading Legions, focused on the empire&rsquo;s latter years, when it was beset by barbarian invasion, an implacable rival, and civil war.&#10;&#10;Rome at War: Queen of the Celts is the third installment in the series. Rome has outstanding heavy infantry, good light cavalry (provided by her allies) and even an elephant. The Britons depend on the fury of their Celtic charge, and also chariots and slingers. Plus they have Druids to help inspire them. &#10; There are nine scenarios, or game situations, included in Queen of the Celts.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

At the start of your turn, you must choose to be Home or Away, giving you access to a different set of actions that you can perform. While Home, you can gain points and abilities by playing cards onto your yard and swaying Neighbors to your side. While Away, you can earn money and get new cards from a shared store, but you leave your yard vulnerable to your rival's mischief. When the last Neighbor has been swayed, the game ends, and whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "During the last space trip, a famous game console was forgotten by a crew member of the Soyuz. It was found by some aliens, that, trying to decipher the cartridge inside it... released thousands of pieces, which drift aimlessly and dangerously through space! Now, they ask humans for help to capture the pieces and clean, thus, the space superhighways.&#10;&#10;Intending to keep the diplomacy across the Galaxy, the International Earthling Government has organized a selection system to fing the best pieces collectors, named PLETRIX. DO YOU DARE TO JOIN IT?&#10;&#10;Pletrix is a game of 1 to 6 players, with a Roll and Write dynamic. The goal is to fill the 5 panels of our board (A,&#10;B, C, D, and E), using the figures obtained in the dice of the corresponding color. The player who gets the highest&#10;score will be the winner.&#10;&#10;Dices:&#10;&#10;There are 10 dice with the figures of the polynomials. 2 dice of each color from one of the 5 panels.&#10;&#10;Panels:&#10;&#10;Pletrix is a Roll&amp;Write game in which we must fill in our 5 panels. Each panel is identified with a letter and a color. To place the figures, the player must be able to choose the group of dice of the same color. You start in one of the initial cells and place the shapes always orthogonally adiacent to another.&#10;&#10;Each panel has its own rules for placement and scoring:&#10;&#10;A PANEL - The final score for this panel will be the result of subtracting twice the number of cells that haven&acute;t been covered from the total number of cells in the panel. For example, if the player has left 10 cells uncovered, they will subtract 20 from the total number of cells, which is 50, so their score will be 30.&#10;&#10;B PANEL- In this Panel, each covered cell equals one point. If there is a tie, the player with the most points on this panel will win.&#10;&#10;C PANEL- The figures in this panel &quot;fall from above&quot; so they will stop where they encounter an obstacle, like Tetris. When completing a line the player will indicate whis by crossing out the corresponding circle. The panel is also divided into 2 5x5 grids, when completing one of them, the player will cross out the circle. Each crossed-out circle is worth 10 points.&#10;&#10;D PANEL- This panel awars as many point as indicates by the star cells you have covered with figures.&#10;&#10;E PANEL- This panel is filled from left to right. To score the value displayed by the circles, the different sections must by completely filled in. If there are any unfilled shares, the previus value will be scored. For example, the player has reached 40, but in the section from 30 to 40, there are empty cells, so the player will only score 30 points.&#10;&#10;The most important cells within the boards are:&#10;&#10;Start- The first figure must be always touching at least one of the star cells.&#10;&#10;Bonus - These special cells grant actions we can activate later. When covering a Bonus cell, the player will draw a line across the corresponding cell to show they got it, and when the action is used, they will draw anoter line forming an X.&#10;&#10;Double - Duplicate a group of dice that we&acute;ve chosen.&#10;&#10;Copy -  Copies a single die of the ones we have chosen.&#10;&#10;Roll: This allows you to roll the dice again. This action can only by perfomed by the active player.&#10;&#10;1 and 2 - Give us the possibilitu to fill 1 or 2 cells. This bonus can&acute;t be saved, it is an immediate action.&#10;&#10;Figures - When we completely cover a figure that is highlighted on the panel, we get that figure, being able to draw it wherever we want.&#10;&#10;Figures blocked panel C - Some figures in panel C are blocked, to unblock them we&acute;ll have to fill them in panel D.&#10;&#10;SETUP&#10;&#10;To star playing, each player takes a notepad and a pencil, leave the dice in the center of the table.&#10;&#10;GAMEROUND&#10;&#10;First, the active player throws all the dice. Then, choose 2 groups of dice to draw the figures shown on their panels. To do this, the player will have to circle the cells drawing the figure in the panel of the same color of the chosen dice. Whenever possible, it is mandatory to place the figures, if it&acute;s not possible, mark one of the error boxes.&#10;&#10;Then, choose a group of dice to put aside, no player will be able to use those dice during this round. The player on their left will take one of the two remaining sets of dice and the rest of the players will have to draw the figures displayed by the remaining dice.&#10;&#10;When everyone has drawn their shapes, the player on the left will be the next active player.&#10;&#10;ENDGAME&#10;&#10;The end is triggered in 2 ways. Ifa a player completes 3 panels, the game ends immediately. If a player marks the third erro box, the game ends when all players have been an active player for the same number of rounds.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, the score is counted. The player with the highest score is the winner. In the case of a tie, the winner is the plauer with the highestscore in panel B, and if it persists, the winner is the player with the highest score in Panel C and then in panel D.&#10;&#10;Pletrix is a game for the whole family, easy, fast and very fun.&#10;&#10;",

The playing map shows in detail the interior of deep space station &lsquo;Prometheus&rsquo;.

The other player controls the various Allied contingents. TOTO has been designed by Joseph Miranda.&#10;&#10;The concept and exploitation of victory points is central to play of the game. Players begin with a designated number of victory points, which they may keep, or expend them to gain reinforcements and execute other actions. Players gain new victory points as a result of achieving their strategic objectives. Players lose victory points when they suffer losses in combat. To win, you must have more victory points than your opponent; so play becomes a competitive balancing act between attaining new objectives without spending too many of your previously earned victory points to do it.&#10;&#10;Each player has a range of unit types available: infantry, cavalry, expeditionary combined arms forces, early mechanized units, air and naval, as well as guerrillas and the major personalities of the era, such as Lawrence of Arabia. Logistics are also critical, as players utilize supply units to enhance their movement and combat capabilities.&#10;&#10;The 34x22&quot; large-hex map covers from Mecca and Medina north through Mesopotamia to the Caucasus, west to the Nile Delta, east to Persia, and northwest to Adrianople, at 87 miles per hex. Each game turn equals a quarter of a year.&#10;&#10;There are 280 half-inch, NATO-style (and some iconic), unit-counters. Units of maneuver are primarily divisions, but numerous corps, brigades, regiments and battalions are also included in the orders of battle.&#10;&#10;There are two short scenarios, one early war and one late war, along with a full campaign game. The rules run to approximately 15,000 words; so two experienced players can finish the campaign game in about six hours.&#10;&#10;",

As such, you must lay out and manage the resources of his district and try to grow as much as you can.&#10;&#10;Each construction that takes place in the game has its advantages and disadvantages, possible to levy taxes or produce food, but also increase the risks of the district making it more prone to flooding, fire, or be unsafe.

On both the Eastern and Western fronts the Allies were on German soil. It seemed only a matter of time before the final battle for the Third Reich would begin...and the victor of that battle could not be in doubt.

In these dense, misty forests, fully 200.000 Gemian troops, 1.500 pieces of heavy artillery and almost 700 tanks assault/guns moved into their assault positions. From his Zaegenberg castle headquarters, Generalfieldmarshall von Rundstedt relayed the following message to the thousands of German troops assembling in the snowy Eifel: &quot;Soldiers of the Western Front!

Whether or not you want to reduce your hand size to push on farther and beat your competition to a castle is just one of the decisions you'll find yourself making every turn.&#10;&#10;Merchants must build paths wisely, for if you can't fully make use of the tiles you play, there is a chance that a competing merchant might be able to speed past you on the path and make his delivery to the castle first. Merchants must also be wary of possible rock slides that can make a path impassable and force them to have to change their plans and find a way around the obstruction. The first merchant to accumulate 18 pieces of gold is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "In Cthulhu: Rise of the Cults, players impersonate cult leaders who are worshipping the Great Old Ones, while at the same time fighting other cults as unworthy of revealing and tasting the prohibited knowledge. It&rsquo;s not an easy task when apart from submitting the acts of faith they must simultaneously carry out the perpetual fight against other cults and maintain maximum discretion around curious investigators and other organizations. Their activities focus on the constant quest for spreading influence as well as celebrating dark rituals which are meant to sow the seeds of insanity and uncertainty in people's minds so as to create the power ready for the advent of what is unnamed and lead to the collapse of the present system at the same time.&#10;&#10;The main arena for the cult activities are cities on the board in which they seek to gain dominance by creating places of worship and celebration of the rituals, as well as challenging other cults into open confrontation which causes disorganization in their structures.&#10;&#10;Cthulhu: Rise of the Cults is an area-control type of game with elements of deck-building in which every leader plans their commands for the turn in order to achieve their goals and destroy their enemies. The leaders have at their disposal their own pile of cards (Cult cards) which reflects the abilities and the potential of their cults. Over the course of the game, each player tries to augment their capabilities by obtaining useful cards in particular cities that will efficiently help them carry out the rituals to sow terror among the residents and hold their own against other leaders.&#10;&#10;Custom-made followers' dice are an element that brings uncertainty and fragility into the game. Players roll them at the beginning of the recruitment phase each turn to gain a temporary group of believers who will support the leaders' planned actions.&#10;&#10;If you hunger for forbidden knowledge, try and join these ranks; perhaps you will meet your worst nightmares...&#10;&#10;",

But unlike Lamarck's giraffes, they may find themselves competing with others for the very same improvements. In the end, the player who has accumulated the best Poker hand wins.&#10;&#10;Can be played using a standard Poker deck without Jokers.&#10;&#10;Players start with four cards. Each round, there are four new cards available. Each player simultaneously chooses a card from her hand. The cards are revealed and then resolved in order from highest to smallest, with suit order breaking ties. Each card takes all the cards of same value OR same suit from the pool and then goes into the pool, so a card played never returns to the hand of the player and later cards can capture earlier cards. The cards that are left in the pool are discarded and a new pool of four cards is dealt.&#10;&#10;This process is repeated as long as there are cards left in the deck, then the player who has the best five-card Poker hand wins the game.&#10;&#10;",
