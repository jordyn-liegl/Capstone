    "description": "Tracticts was created in 1971 by Mike Reese and Leon Tucker with contributions by Gary Gygax.&#10;&#10;Its theme was World War 2 Combat and it was published by Guidon Games in 1971 and republished by TSR, Inc. in 1975. Its combat style involved 1:285 scale micro armour miniatures. When it was first created it used the 1/87 scale miniatures that were common but this later changed.&#10;&#10;The game came as a boxed set containing three booklets illustrated by Don Lowry.&#10;&#10;Tractics was innovative when it was published due to the fact that it was the first game that was published using a 20-sided die.&#10;&#10;In 1968 Reese and Tucker, two members of the LGTSA, began play-testing rules for tank combat that would eventually form the core of Tractics. Gygax contributed some rules on infantry, covered in the second booklet, and the third booklet would cover additional topics such as airstrikes and the MODERN period (which at the time included rumors of the XM-1 tank).&#10;&#10;The players must first acquire the miniatures and build the terrain. Reese and Tucker were interested in an accurate simulation, and as a result the game provides data describing the rate of movement, thickness of armor, and rate of fire for the makes of tank in service from 1940 to 1970. The tanks in Tractics have a 30% chance to hit a target which in essence means rolling at least a 15 on the 20 sided die. The modifiers of battle apply depending upon several factors such as concealment. The game is consequently slower to conduct than a board wargame such as Tactics II. For miniature wargamers who felt that the amount of detail was excessive, Reese and Tucker recommended their earlier Fast Rules (1970) although that set covered WWII only.&#10;&#10;Tractics requires the use of a judge. Since players are unaware of their enemies locations, the pieces are placed on the map only when they are detected or they march to an open view.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Dragon Chess first appeared in Dragon Magazine issue 100, and was also featured in the short story &quot;At Moonset Blackcat Comes&quot; in the same issue. It is a 3D Chess game that is played on three 8x12 boards stacked above each other. The top board represents the air and features pieces like the Griffon and the Dragon. The middle board represents the land and has pieces like the Oliphant, the Thief, and (of course) the King. The bottom board represents the underworld and contains pieces like the Dwarf and the Elemental.&#10;&#10;Like regular chess, the object is to checkmate your opponent's King. Many pieces move like their chess counterparts, but many others have unconventional moves taken from other chess variants that are further complicated by the game's three dimensional nature.&#10;&#10;For example, on the upper board, a Sylph piece moves like a Berolina pawn. It may make a non-capturing move one space diagonally forward, or it may capture by moving directly forward one space. It may also capture by moving straight down to the middle board. While on the middle board, the Sylph cannot move at all except to make a non-capturing move back to the top board. It may move to the square directly above it OR any empty one of the six home squares that any friendly Sylph occupied at the start of the game.&#10;&#10;",

Each player receives three or four stacks of four cards, depending on the number of players. On the cards, you can see cats in thirteen different moods: sometimes winking, sometimes friendly, sometimes grinning widely. Your goal is to have only cards of a single mood in each stack.&#10;&#10;Once a round begins, all players simultaneously exchange exactly one card from one of their stacks with a card from the center of the table; exchanging cards from one stack to another is forbidden. As soon as a player has collected four identical cards in each of their stacks, they shout, &quot;Stop!&quot; to end the current round. Everyone then reveals their stacks, and for each stack with four identical cards, the owner of that stack scores 1 point. The player who ended the round scores 1 bonus point as long as they didn't make a mistake; if they did, they score 0 points for the round. The game ends as soon as a player has reached 20 points, and whoever has the most points wins!&#10;&#10;",

At the beginning of the game, players will take two different cards of their &quot;team&quot; (in favor, against, or to be neutral in the &quot;magnicide&quot;) and they must discard one of these cards before the second round of votes take place in order to choose their final team.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

In accord with tradition, the leaders of the major bands of thieves have only until dawn to gather the wealth that will prove them worthy to be the new Arch Thief. They must steal from strangers and fellow thieves alike, avoid the watch, keep their gold close, and keep a very close eye on their rivals.&#10;&#10;Deck of Thieves is a fast-playing, tactical, cut-throat card game of hand-management for two to four players (up to eight players when using two game sets).&#10;&#10;Each player receives an identical deck of cards. In addition to Gold Coin cards, the action cards in the game each have up to three effects: Ability, Activate, and/or Reaction. In turn, each player may play a card to his play area and apply its Ability or Activate a card already in his play area from a previous turn. On another player's turn, players may play a card with a Reaction effect to counter an opponent's card. In addition to these three actions, during their turns, players may move Gold Coin cards around within their play areas (placing a Gold Coin card on top of a Coin Purse card for protection, for example).&#10;&#10;Example cards include Dagger, Cutpurse, Pickpocket, Lock Box, Guild Hall, Traveling Merchant, Lock Pick, Thieves' Tools, and the Dirty Thief.&#10;&#10;Using these and other cards' Abilities, Activates, and Reactions, players both seek to steal the Gold Coin cards from their opponents--adding them to their play area--and protect their own Gold Coin cards from being stolen. Once a player has 7 Gold Coin cards in his play area, the game ends after one more complete set of turns or when one player is completely out of cards.&#10;&#10;Each card in the game has a gold value; the player with the highest gold value wins the game!&#10;&#10;",

Players will be using cards to buy scientific inquiry and field research resources racing to activate their golems before the tide of public outrage turns against them. A Public Outrage Track is used for this. If this track reaches (25) both players will lose, so they must work cooperatively to keep the public at ease about their experiments while still competing against each other.&#10;&#10;Requirements:&#10;For this game you&rsquo;ll need the deck of 54 cards consisting of:&#10;&#10;&bull; 12 Capek Golem body part cards, 6 per player&#10;&bull; 39 game cards showing areas of scientific inquiry, gold coins and field research journal entries&#10;&bull; 3 cards which make up the Auction House and Public Outrage Track&#10;&bull; 40 markers for the Capek Golem cards (eurocubes work well) [Alternately you can use 6d6 per player, placing one die on each Golem card and rotating the die up each time a resource is gained towards the specified total.] and one additional marker for the Public Outrage Track&#10;&#10;To win a player must activate all six parts of their Capek Golem. Activating a single card includes having all Field Research resources as well as playing one set of Scientific Inquiry cards matching the number total on one of the two colored circular icons. If the Public Outrage Track ever reaches (25) both players lose the game.&#10;&#10;Play:&#10;A player may do any of the following actions but may do each action only once during that turn:&#10;1. Buy cards from the Auction Area and play them immediately or place it in your hand.&#10;Purchase a single card at its Auction value by discarding cards with an equal or greater number of gold coins. Then discard it immediately and take Field Research resources as indicated, and move the token up or down the Public Outrage Track, or place the card in your hand and use it later on for its gold value or to complete a Scientific Inquiry set. Repeat buying a card as desired.&#10;&#10;2. Discard a set of Scientific Inquiry cards and mark gained resources on your Capek Golem Cards.&#10;Discarding a completed set, matching both a color and number as indicated on a Capek Golem card, allows you to place a marker in that resource area, helping to activate that card. You can choose either of the two color types to collect for a set, but you cannot make a set with a mix of both colors. There are 3 special wild cards in the game which may be used in any set and can take the place of one or two cards (as marked). If you use one of these cards in a Scientific Inquiry set, you must move the token on the Public Outrage Track as indicated.&#10;&#10;3. Discard one card to draw two new cards from the Draw Pile.&#10;A player may discard any one card from his hand to draw two new cards from the Draw Pile.&#10;&#10;Additional Rules of Play:&#10;If at the start of a player&rsquo;s turn the player has fewer than two cards in hand, they should draw two cards from the Draw Pile before completing any of the three actions.&#10;&#10;If the Draw Pile is ever exhausted, shuffle the Discard Pile and create a new Draw Pile.&#10;&#10;If at any time the marker is moved to the (25) space on the Public Outrage Track the game ends immediately and both players lose.&#10;&#10;Winner of the BGG Quick Print and Play Design Challenge&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Filled with magic and mystery, Germany&rsquo;s Black Forest is a place of legend serving as the backdrop for the classic tales we&rsquo;ve all come to adore. Darkness and danger lurk around every corner, but those who dare to enter the forest and face challenging encounters with creativity and cunning will come out on the other side enriched for having taken the journey...into the Black Forest!&#10;&#10;The game takes places over 2-3 rounds (depending on the number of players) with each round consisting of three &quot;encounters&quot; or hands. In the game, each player uses their own deck of cards numbered 1-12 that depicts four creatures that will help them journey through the forest: frogs (#1-3), squirrels (#4-6), lynx (#7-9), and owls (#10-12). In addition to the creatures on the cards, each deck has a unique distribution of four suits of magical items: wands, potions, spell books, and swords.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of each round, players draw six cards from their personal deck and reveal three cards from the central encounter deck. The encounter cards direct the play of each hand and provide a glimpse of what challenges lie ahead for future encounters. Players take turns playing a card to an open slot around the outside of the encounter cards with each side scoring in a different way once the encounter card is surrounded. At the bottom, the low card beats the high card, taking the value of the high card for points. To the left side, the card played scores its value only if its suit matches one of the cards played above. On the top, the high card beats the low card, taking the value of the low card for points. And on the right side of the card, players may each play one card face down, hoping to meet the unique win condition for the card or to bluff or sluff to throw off the other adventurer and buy themselves extra time. After playing three hands, new encounters are revealed, then players choose from their remaining cards and newly drawn cards to prepare for the next round.&#10;&#10;Into the Black Forest is a new classic card game that provides a challenging puzzle of hand management, planning, and tactical decisions. Fans of trick-taking, area control, and light bluffing will love taking a journey into the Black Forest!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

Gameplay loosely resembles poker, while hand scoring resembles blackjack. Players are dealt an initial hand, then can draw more cards to their hand, while wagering over the value of hands. Wagers are paid into two pots, a Hand Pot and a Sabacc Pot. Once the hand has been called, players reveal their hand to win the Hand Pot: the winner is the player with the highest hand value that is doesn't exceed 23. A player with a hand that totals exactly 23 or -23 has Pure Sabacc and wins the Sabacc Pot. Since unwon pots roll over into the next hand's Sabacc Pot, the Sabacc Pot can grow to be quite large.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Play as one of six characters from The Office, as their boss Michael Scott forces them to play a real-life game of Clue to determine who killed the HR rep, Toby. Gameplay is similar to standard Clue, with special &quot;intrigue cards&quot; new to the game.&#10;&#10;Intrigue cards come in two varieties: Clocks and Keepers.  They are obtained in one of three ways: rolling a question mark on the included custome dice, landing on a question mark on the board, or if your character is moved to a room as part of someone starting a rumor (equivalent to Clue's &quot;making a suggestion.&quot;)  The first two situations incur a forced draw, while the third is optional.  There are eight clock cards in the intrigue deck, and if you draw the eighth card then you automatically lose.  Keepers give a one-time bonus that allow you to slightly alter some of the game's parameters...risk of drawing a clock; potential reward of benefiting from a keeper.&#10;&#10;Additionally, each of the six characters have a &quot;personality card&quot; which alows for a one-time power.  For example, Dwight's reads: &quot;Once per game, you may move twice.  Roll the dice, move, then roll again.&quot;&#10;&#10;The winner gets &quot;an extra week of vacation&quot; from Michael Scott!&#10;&#10;",

Each player receives a hand of three cards.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you draw 0-4 cards from the deck depending on which card was played the previous turn. (The first player of the game optionally draws one card.) Then you can play a card face up or face down in the pyramid. Within a row, card values must escalate from left to right; when placing a card on a higher row, that card must be supported by two other cards and the newly placed card's value must be between the values of the two supporting cards. When you place a card face down, you ignore the value restriction.&#10;&#10;Alternatively, you can discard two cards to the reserve, then draw a card from the reserve that equals the sum or the difference of these two cards. (You can discard other cards in your hand from the game to raise or lower this sum/difference by 1 for each such card.) You then place this card from the reserve in the tower, either in an empty spot or in place of another card (with you adding this replaced card to your hand).&#10;&#10;If you manage to create a card tower seven layers tall (i.e., with 28 cards) and all those cards are face up, then you win.&#10;&#10;Once you play a few times, you can add the Finish card (#25) to the game. During set-up, you shuffle this card in the bottom half of the deck. Whoever draws it places this card in front of themselves, then draws a replacement card. The Finish card is part of this player's hand, but doesn't count against their three-card hand limit. The Finish card cannot be played face down, and if it's removed from the tower, it must be placed face up in front of the active player. The Finish card must be the final card played at the top of the tower for players to win.&#10;&#10;",

During the game, players place and replace the agents adjacently to others with matching colors &mdash; the same or one of the two neighbored colors on the color circle. Tiles can be flipped before being replaced, and later flipped again and again. Since the tiles show different colors on the sides - again two colors neighbored on the color wheel - there is a strong deduction element in the game (while younger kids rather will play it using their memory).&#10;&#10;For the highest score you need to score for all colors more or less equally.

The aim of the game is to assemble gangs, destroy your rivals and overthrow the Cartel to win. You do this by collecting sets, stealing from your opponents and matching the Cartel cards. As you play, you&rsquo;ll learn what gangs you gotta collect to topple the Cartel. And then you&rsquo;ll need to bluff, steal and screw people over to get the gangs you need. There can be only one winner; everyone else will sleep with the dishes.&#10;&#10;Throughout the game, you&rsquo;ll draw gang and action cards from the draw deck, and then take up to three moves. You can lay gang cards in your Turf - that&rsquo;s where your gangs are assembled; you can protect your gang cards with security cards; you can use an action card to steal from an opponent; and you can start a Turf War with the Cartel. But be warned, the more you steal from your rivals, the more likely they&rsquo;ll be to take revenge. And if you don&rsquo;t match at least two full gangs with the Cartel during a Turf War, you&rsquo;ll lose those gangs to the discard pile.&#10;&#10;Plant Based Riot is a light strategy, set collecting, card matching tabletop card game for 2-5 players. There&rsquo;s gangs of terrible edibles, there&rsquo;s thieving fruit, and there&rsquo;s tons of card-based carnage. It&rsquo;s got all the brutality of an actual food fight, only with way less clearing up afterwards. It&rsquo;s designed with fluidity and fun in mind. It&rsquo;s adaptable to all experience levels - from beginners to veterans - and age groups from 8 to 88. It&rsquo;s also scalable, so the experience is just as riotous whether you&rsquo;re playing one-on-one or a 5-way battle royale.&#10;&#10;A typical game takes between 15 and 30 minutes, depending on the number of players. And, like organic mushrooms, no two games of Plant Based Riot are the same, thanks to its unique mechanic. You won&rsquo;t need any dice or additional pieces to play. Just a dastardly desire to collect and conquer.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "From DecisionGames.com:&#10;&#10;Air War Over the Solomons&#10;&#10;The island of Guadalcanal in the South Pacific was the base for American aircraft squadrons that engaged Japanese Navy and Army air forces over the Solomons. Those squadrons became known as the &ldquo;Cactus Air Force&rdquo; (from the codename given to the island itself). Cactus Air Force is a two- player wargame covering the air campaign over the Solomon Islands during critical period late in 1942. Both the American and Japanese players move their bombers to attack critical targets while using fighters to struggle for air superiority.&#10;&#10;Each player controls units representing air groups. All of the famous aircraft are here: Japanese Zeroes, Bettys and Oscars, and Allied F4F Wildcats, P-40s, and B-17s. Each unit is rated for air superiority, bombing and speed. The game uses a new and unique system that facilitates aerial operations, dispensing with the usual record keeping. The map covers the entire Solomon Island chain centered on Guadalcanal.&#10;&#10;Cactus Air Force is part of the Air Wars mini-game series. Each player has a deck of Campaign Cards. They generate a range of events, including major naval battles such as Eastern Solomons, to which players can commit their air units. Certain cards can be played in combination to gain operational advantage, leading to tense decision making. There are special rules for Henderson Field, fighter-bombers, and the Tokyo Express.&#10;&#10;",

Your training had just begun when a Black Wizard murdered the Wizard King to fuel an evil ritual. Unguided, you must complete your training to be able to stop the Black Wizard. You must stop the ritual, and do it quickly, because not only could the ritual destroy this way of life, someone less worthy might rise and take the throne before you.&#10;&#10;In Heirs of the Wizard King, each color of Wizard uses a unique type of spell that you can choose to command or absorb. Commanding a wizard allows the player to use their spell one time. If absorbed, you can then permanently use a reduced version of that spell. This absorbed power starts small, but you can continue to invest in, and eventually master, that spell.&#10;&#10;To defeat the Black Wizard, players forge Chains of Wizards by matching any combination of color/number. This task appears simple, but with each completed Chain, the difficulty increases as each Chain requires one additional card. The first player to reach the top of the score track defeats the Black Wizard and becomes the next Wizard King.&#10;&#10;Meanwhile, the Ritual of the Black Wizard is not an idle threat. On every player's turn, the Black Wizard's Chain is dealt one card from the deck. If that weren't bad enough, whenever the Deck runs out of cards, the Black Wizard advances one spot on his score track. Unchecked, the Black Wizard would quickly overwhelm and destroy the players. Players must work together to stop the Black Wizard, but in the end only one can be crowned the next Wizard King.&#10;&#10;What type of King will you be?&#10;&#10;",

Mr M remains hidden amongst them, poised to exact his justice...&#10;&#10;This is cooperative deduction game that pits 1 player against the remaining players who seeks to deduce the identity after 5 rounds or characters have been eliminated.&#10;&#10;The 13 characters are placed in the palace and the player playing Mr M receives 10 Murder cards. Mr M takes the top 2 cards from the Suspects deck and picks 1 as his character.&#10;&#10;The turn continues with Character cards laid out (exact number based on players) in a row. The other players take turns activating 1 of the laid out Character card (the activated character then moves and activate his/her ability if necessary)each in order to deduce Mr M's identity and/or limit his killing options. Lastly, Mr M either activates the 2 remaining unused characters or 1 of the used characters. He finishes off his turn by playing a Murder card that kills one of the other characters in the palace, following all the rules and limitations listed on the murder card. The other players know which character died - but they do not know how. The used Murder card is then placed over the Character card of the murdered character.&#10;&#10;After 5 rounds or 5 characters have been killed, whichever is earlier, players would have to deduce the identity of Mr M.&#10;&#10;If a character is moved into a murdered character's location, the players can reveal the Murder card and use the information to isolate their suspect. For example, the Murder card:Death by Hanging might read; use to kill any one character in a room that is in the same column of rooms as Mr M. Another Murder card:Gunpowder Plot, would say; kill all characters in a room adjacent to Mr M.&#10;&#10;",

However, some cards allow you to remove fatigue from other cards and others allow you to increase population without fatigue, and finding these options can be the way to victory.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Players must guide Ichabod from the Van Tassel mansion through the forest to the covered bridge before time runs out and the Headless Horseman chases him down. Players will need to push their luck, avoid frights, and keep their wits to get Ichabod safely home!&#10;&#10;In the game, one player will have 60 minutes (12 units of Time) to travel across 9 Woods cards in the Forest Row and reach the Covered Bridge. To do so, players will draw cards from the Journey Deck, typically placing them next to the deck to form the Fright Row. Woods cards that appear will have one of three good luck symbols on them. When there are two or more Woods cards in the Fright Row with a matching symbol, the player can spend one Time to take one of each matching Woods cards and place them into the Forest Row. The catch is that Woods cards cannot be placed in the Forest Row next to another Woods card that has the same good luck symbol.&#10;&#10;Fright cards may appear from the Journey Deck, as well. These three cards - a wolf, a bat, and an owl - are placed into the Fright Row. If at any time there is a matching pair of Fright cards in the Fright Row, the entire Fright Row is discarded. If there was a matching set of Woods cards in the Fright Row then the player loses no time. If not, the player loses one Time.&#10;&#10;If there are ever three different Fright cards in the Fright Row then the entire Fright Row is discarded and the player loses two Time.&#10;&#10;There are also several Event cards in the deck that, when drawn, trigger an effect and are discarded. These can range from the Torch which allows the player to discard Fright cards from the Fright Row, to the Headless Horseman himself which forces the player to discard the lead Woods card in the Forest Row if there are any Fright cards in the Fright Row.&#10;&#10;",

The goal is to be the first player to catch the required number of trophy fish, which varies by player count.&#10;&#10;Players take turns rolling or flicking a D12 dice from their jetty towards the cards in the middle, trying to get as close as possible to a target card. When the dice stops, a fish is caught if the dice roll (along with any bonuses) is equal or higher to the catch rate of the closest fish. Players can also use caught fish as bait, and items from the Bait &amp; Tackle shop to increase their chances of catching fish. The game is fast to learn, but offers strategic options as players become more familiar with the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
