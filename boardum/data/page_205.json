Players place these cards on the table, creating a pattern, and score points for matching gems on adjacent cards.&#10;&#10;A player always has a hand of 3 cards. On his turn, he places one on the table, adjacent to at least one other card half. He now scores points for the number of gems matching the type/color of its neighbours. Placement and scoring are limited by the fact that there may never be more than 7 gems of one kind in a continuous row.&#10;&#10;The game ends after 7 rounds. The player with the highest total points wins.&#10;&#10;An enhanced edition from Wargames Club Publishing will include a sand timer and variant rules for more tight playing.&#10;&#10;",

Flooded with radiation, the planet surface is largely unfit for life. Handfuls of survivors have found refuge in antinuclear bunkers, the largest of which is the Moscow Metro. The Metro has become humanity&rsquo;s last haven after Judgment Day.&#10;&#10;Metro 2033 is based on the popular Metro 2033 universe created by Russian writer and journalist Dmitry Glukhovsky. After the nuclear strike, thousands of survivors have found refuge in the Moscow underground (a.k.a., the Metro) &mdash; the biggest shelter in the world. In the stations and tunnels deep below the surface a new civilization emerges.&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;&#10;Each player is a leader of one of the many factions of post-nuclear underground. In order to win, a faction has to achieve ten victory points (VPs). Each station under the faction's control gives it 1 VP; different quests also bring VPs when completed. The other way to win is to capture all four stations of Polis &mdash; the cultural and political heart of Metro. Each faction has a hero at its disposal. Heroes can travel the underground, gain quests and equipment that increases their abilities, fight opponents' heroes, attack stations, and so on. The army of a faction can also attack stations, and usually with better chances to win, but it can target only adjacent stations. Stations under factions' control produce resources &mdash; pigs, ammo and mushrooms &mdash; that are used to capture new stations, strenghten the army, buy equipment and obtain quests. The production of resources and other game events are determined by a special sequence. This sequence tells what will happen each round: production of certain recources, a vote for a new law, or a sudden attack from the dark that must be repelled.&#10;&#10;Players can attack stations with their armies or their heroes. Both have strength that may be increased by hiring new troops or buying useful equipment. When attacking a neutral station, the army/hero fights a random threat from the special deck and has to beat its strength. When attacking an opponent, the attacker confronts his army or hero. In battles between players a special set of combat cards is used; these cards give various bonuses to strength depending on the card chosen by the opponent, so the goal is to deduce which combat card will be used by the other side.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Tako Judo &ndash; the timeless sport of octopus wrestling &ndash; is an abstract strategy game for 2 to 4 players in which the object is to prevent your opponent(s) from being able to move. Played on a 64-square board (for two players) or a 100-square board (for three or four players), each player controls the head and eight tentacles of an octopus. The head takes up a 2x2 square area, and each tentacle takes up one square. Any piece can move like a Chess queen (any distance along an open orthogonal or diagonal line, but without jumping) provided that there is also a clear line of sight between that piece's original location and the head piece for the octopus to which it belongs. A player whose octopus is no longer able to effectively move its head or any tentacles (either move them at all or only harmlessly move a tentacle back and forth between a couple of squares) is pinned and eliminated from the game. Last octopus to move freely controls the sea and wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Desperados is a partnership game where players in teams of two must work together to get the most points. In Reiner Knizia&#039;s first published game, there are nine mine-opening cards and nine mine-closing cards.  To score any points you've got to play gold, silver or copper cards onto the corresponding open mine and then close it.  Trouble is, your opponents can close your mine before you want or even try to steal it with bandit cards -- a tough gauntlet to run, but here and there a few points trickle through and into the scoring column.  On your turn you either play a card OR draw a card -- not both -- making this rapid-fire card game move at its own special pace, which is very quickly indeed. It was designed primarily for partnership play, and appreciated best by players with good partnership skills. For players who do not want a partnership experience, there are variations for 2 or 3 players.&#10;&#10;Originally published as Digging by Hexagames in 1990 (Later by Avalanche Press with new pictures on the cards and a trivial rules tweak). Released as Desperados in 2009 by Eagle-Gryphon Games.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Subtitle: Six Bridges: The Battle of Pittsburgh, October 1, 1863&#10;&#10;It was early September 1863 &amp; Gen. Robert E. Lee was perplexed. He'd smashed the Army of the Potomac at Gettysburg, then chewed up its remnants as it tried to defend Washington, captured that city, though much of it was burned in the process, and came within card throw of bagging both Lincoln &amp; Grant. But instead of gaining the Confederacy the ultimate victory Lee had sought when he began that risky campaign, the fall of Washington served only to radicalize &amp; galvanize the North.&#10;&#10;Lincoln has sailed to Boston to set up a new US capital. He declined the 'offer of mediation toward peace' extended by the ambassadors of Great Britain &amp; France. London &amp; Paris soon recognized the Confederacy - the government of which now housed in the charred &amp; bullet-pocked city of Washington, DD (that is, the District of Dixie!), and announced they would join the war to secure its independence.&#10;&#10;But then, before Union &amp; Anglo-French naval vessels even exchanged their first broadsides, the Prussians made their move, declaring for the Union &amp; launching strong attacks into France &amp; Bavaria. That led the Austrians; ever jealous and fearful their Prussian cousins were aiming to supplant their primacy in the Germanic world, to throw in with France. Then the Czar mobilized his millions of newly emancipated serfs, creating the largest single army yet seen on the planet, leading them in an attack on Vienna.&#10;&#10;With the CSA, Britain, France &amp; Austria on one side, fighting the USA, Prussia &amp; Russia on the other, World War I began in August 1863. &quot;Home Before the Leaves Fall&quot; was the cry heard across the northern hemisphere.&#10;&#10;Lee convinced Jefferson Davis to reinforce him by shifting troops fromBragg;'s Army to create a 4th Corps for the Army of Northern Virginia. Comprised of Tennessee men &amp; recruits from the new Confederate state of Maryland, Gen. Pat Cleburne was picked to run it. Lee intended to use the new Corps as a screen for his next offensive.&#10;&#10;With the fall of Vicksburg, &amp; Port Hudson, Lee reasoned Gen.Sherman would move east to relieve the Union's fortunes. If he could intercept Sherman &amp; destroy his army before it linked with Grant's, the war would surely end. Scanning his maps, Lee determined Pittsburgh was the key. If he controlled it, he would sever the only east / west rail line left to the Union. It was also the perfect place to meet the British (actually Anglo-Canadian) Expeditionary Force forming in Canada for a crossing of Lake Erie.&#10;&#10;Lee sent an outline of his plan to the Commander of the BEF, Sir Patrick Macdougall, who was highly receptive, sending a reply in which he promised to rendezvous with lee at Pittsburgh on or around October 1.&#10;&#10;Until 14 September, Grant &amp; Lincoln had assumed Lee's next move would be in the Northeast. On that day a minister of the Canadian government, a strong abolition man, defected with a copy of the Confederate general's letter. After much debate, the two US war leaders convinced themselves the document was authentic &amp; set about to counter Lee's plan. The 3rd Corps was left to defend the Susquehanna River line, in case they were wrong, and a telegram was sent to Sherman instructing him to move to Pittsburgh as quickly as possible.&#10;&#10;By the 17th, when Lee began marching northeast towards Pittsburgh, Grant had already stolen a day's march on him. The question became who would get to the city first to meet Lee &amp; Grant: the BEF, shuttling across Lake Erie then marching down the western borderlands of Pennsylvania, or Sherman, coming up the Ohio valley. Neither Grant nor Lee knew who would be reinforced first or exactly when, but both understood there would be a savage fight for Pittsburgh. It would go into southern history books as the Battle of Six Bridges.&#10;&#10;As noted, it is an alternative history of American Civil War, prequel of this is Wahoo! -- The Battle of Washington, July 8, 1863.&#10;&#10;",

In the game, you will control the Persian forces and must fight the small band of Spartans warriors who are blocking your path at the Thermopylae pass in 480 BC. All units on the board are represented by dice which are rotated to show their current strength. You goal is to eliminate all the Spartan units so that Xerxes army can use the pass and continue their invasion of Greece.&#10;&#10;The game uses a simplified Command and Colors system similar to C&amp;C Ancients or The Great War. Each turn you will draw two cards and choose one to use to command certain troops on the board and one to use for its tactical event. Each card also has a Spartan Event, which will modify the way they fight and give them advantages against your troops.&#10;&#10;The game is played using a total of 9 cards, 16 dice, and 2 cubes. One card contains the map for the game, another the turn and status tracks, and the other seven cards contain the game's activations and events. Each of those card has three sections on it 1.) Persian Command 2.) Persian Tactics and 3.) Spartan Event. You will only need to look at the relevant event for the current phase of the game.&#10;&#10;Each turn is played out in a series of phases.&#10;1. Card Draw Phase&#10;2. Spartan Event Phase&#10;3. Tactics Phase&#10;4. Command Phase&#10;5. Spartan Attack Phase&#10;6. Victory or Loss Check Phase&#10;7. End of Day Phase&#10;&#10;Despite the small number of components and short playing time, the game presents a challenging experience and interesting historical narrative for this famous battle. Can you beat the historical result and lead your Persian soldiers to victory over the Greeks with minimal Persian casualties? Or will your soldiers get massacred by the Spartan war machine?&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Between 1767 and 1846, war and intrigue dominated the Indian sub-continent. War constantly flared between the Indian kingdoms, both against one another and against the British and French interlopers. The Europeans, meanwhile, also busily fought each other.&#10;&#10;Rob Markham's Soldier Raj builds on the highly successful model of Soldier Emperor to portray these conflicts. Over a dozen scenarios cover these wars, from Hyder Ali's defeat of the British in the First Mysore War in 1767 to Britain's final conquest of the Sikhs in 1846. Colorful leaders of the time are all present: Hyder Ali and Tippoo of Mysore. Sir Arthur Wellesley, the &quot;sepoy general&quot; who would become Duke of Wellington. The brilliant Madhav Rao of the Marathas. France's Admiral Suffren. Zaman Shah of Afghanistan, and the Sikh ruler Ranjit Singh. These and more lead your armies.&#10;&#10;The playing pieces are the decadently thick tiles seen in Soldier Emperor and Granada: The Fall of Moslem Spain. Artist Terry Moore Strickland has gone well beyond those games; pieces like the Mysore Tiger Soldier or the Maratha War Elephant are tiny works of art.&#10;&#10;As in Soldier Emperor, successful card play is a key to victory. Soldier Raj features high-quality playing cards, and includes a new deck of these for use in Soldier Emperor when playing the two games together.&#10;&#10;Soldier Raj can also be played together with Soldier Emperor: Napoleon's Wars 1803-1815. Players can either add more seats at the table, or assign the Indian kingdoms to players with only European holdings. Britain becomes both more powerful in the combined game, and more vulnerable.&#10;&#10;As in Soldier Emperor: Napoleon's Wars 1803-1815, players command their nation's military, political and economic destiny. The map is a painting of South Asia, with a network of areas and routes between them laid over it. Generals move their armies along these routes, attempting to conquer territory for their nation. Fleets control the seas around India; the locals have very little seapower, and Britain outnumbers France on the seas.&#10;&#10;Combat is resolved by dice rolls, with larger armies casting more dice. Good generalship is even more crucial in India than in Europe. Players win by taking the most territory, or by destroying their nation's enemies.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Manila '45: Stalingrad of the Pacific (M'45), is a two-player, low-to-intermediate complexity wargame that simulates the American liberation of the capital of the Philippines in World War II, which took place from 3 February to 4 March 1945. To control complexity and present an overall-force-commander's-view of the battle, the game uses a tactically scaled map and units of maneuver coupled with an operationally scaled game turn length. The American player is generally on the offensive, trying to clear the entire Japanese defending force from the city prior to the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Each game turn of M'45 equals three days. Each hexagon on the map represents 0.3 miles (0.5 km) from side to opposite side. The units of maneuver in the game are companies, batteries and battalions, representing anywhere from a about 100 to 1,000 men and their equipment.&#10;&#10;Historically the Japanese fought to the last man (literally, not metaphorically), and the game's victory conditions represent that brutally absolute mindset. To determine the winner, both players examine the map at the end of Game Turn 10. If at that time there's one or more Japanese units still in play anywhere, the Japanese player is declared to have won the game. If there are no Japanese units left on the map at that time, the US player is declared to have won the game. Of course, if all Japanese units are wiped out prior to the end of the last game turn, play stops and the US player is declared the victor. No draws are possible.&#10;&#10;Tacticians will enjoy the fact there are 22 unit types in the game: heavy artillery, heavy anti-aircraft, heavy mortar, heavy rocket artillery, naval infantry (armed ship crews), regular infantry, combat engineers, heavy weapons (machineguns), anti-aircraft, military police, anti-tank, field artillery, rear echelon ad hoc infantry, glider infantry, paratroopers, bridging engineers, mortars, armored cavalry, tanks, self-propelled artillery, amphibious tractors, and self-propelled anti-tank.&#10;&#10;",

The Gangs, Thugs, Minions, and Villains of New Dover immediately noticed the power vacuum in the city and began to assert themselves.  The city is reeling from their attacks!  What can be done?&#10;&#10;The Sidekicks of the Super Heroes haven't given up the fight!  They know they aren't as powerful as the Bad Guys, but they are courageous and resourceful.  They know where the Heroes have helpful technologies, weapons, and devices.  To help each other out, the Sidekicks have set-up supply lines between themselves to share useful things! They will protect New Dover!  And maybe along the way, they can find out what happened to the Super Heroes...&#10;&#10;This is their story: this is The Sidekick Saga.&#10;&#10;Sidekick Saga is a cooperative adventure, combat, and exploration game for 1-4  players (ages 13 and up). It takes 60-90 minutes for one game.  There is also an ongoing story to find the missing Super Heroes!&#10;&#10;For 2--4 players, each player takes control of one of the Sidekick characters in the game. A solo player will take control of two Sidekick characters and will play them both as if it were a 2-Player game.&#10;&#10;The players work together to defeat the current Villain and their Villain Forces.  This is a cooperative game: the Sidekicks win or lose together! There is only one way to win (usually): the players must defeat the main Villain by reducing him to 0 Hit Points!   There are many ways to lose!&#10;&#10;If all Sidekicks are defeated (reduced to 0 Hit Points), the Villain wins! Note: only 1 Sidekick needs to survive for the Sidekicks to win! Sometimes, other Sidekicks will take one for the team to defeat the Villain!&#10;&#10;If time runs out, the Villain has stalled long enough to bring his evil scheme to fruition, and he wins!  This happens if the Villain is still alive at the End of Act III (when the last Bad News card comes out).&#10;&#10;If the City Terror ever gets too high (16 on the City Terror track), the Sidekicks lose!&#10;&#10;Sidekick Saga is a light legacy game of exploration (moving around the city), &quot;drafting&quot; (sharing cards cooperatively), variable player powers (each Sidekick has different powers) and hand management (playing cards appropriately), and combat (fighting bad guys).  Players move around the city looking for weapons, ideas, leads, anything to help them take out the Bad Guys!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Your objective is to finish the day (after playing 2 matches, morning and afternoon) as the most decorated gladiator school of Rome, and winner of the day! Players can achieve this in 2 ways: either capture an opponent's Eagle (and receive Medal of Eagle), or by having the most denarii (GladiGala's coins) in your Treasury as a match ends (receive Medal of Coin). In GladiGala all the results of what happens in the arena are translated into coins, by which players can also manage their gladiator team during the match (upgrade a hurt gladiator, create advanced maneuvers, or enter the arena's &quot;Safe Zone&quot;).&#10;&#10;As a Gladiator School Leader it is up to you to gain coins and fill your Treasury for marvelous tactical performances and for making accurate strategic choices. Outwit your opponents, make the most of your gladiators' formation, manage your Treasury wisely, and get the crowds on your side chanting GladiGala's mantra: &quot;Always aim for an eagle &ndash; always stand guard!&quot;&#10;&#10;GladiGala is a simultaneous game played in multiple rounds. First, players use magnetic panels/cards to give movements, maneuvering, and action orders to all gladiators. Each game players enter the arena with a different gladiator formation, made from GladiGala's 4 gladiator types: Sword, Spear, Dagger, and Club, each has a different set of abilities. After giving movements orders, players place their attacks trying to anticipate their opponent's moves. Finally, cards are revealed and all gladiators perform accordingly. A gladiator moving to an attacked area is marked as &quot;Hit&quot;. A gladiator hit twice is out of the arena!&#10;&#10;Welcome to Rome, 101 A.D.&#10;&#10;The city's center stage is set up and ready for GladiGala, the year's greatest show of skill in the arena.  Rome's 4 finest Gladiator Schools; ACADEMIA &ndash; LEO &ndash; SOLIS &amp; SPIRITUS &ndash; appear in the arena for a glorious day of tactical contest in the pursuit of title and Medal of Champion!&#10;&#10;Morning rises and the crowds make their way to the arena. The teams all gear up, final preparations are made, last instructions are given. Your gladiator formation for the morning match is set and ready to head out the gate. Your gladiators are holding to their eagle, your house symbol of honor and respect. You hope they will be holding it to the end&hellip;&#10;&#10;Trumpets are blown, the crowds are ecstatic: &quot;open the gates!&quot; you hear them shouting, frantic.  GladiGala begins: Shlak Shlak Shlak &ndash; all gates are raised announcing it's time to storm Rome's most celebrated central stage!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Each player starts with 11 cards in hand, and 11 cards are placed in a deck on the table. Each round, reveal the top card of the deck; each player then selects one card from hand and reveals them simultaneously. Whichever side - duck or robot &mdash; has the highest sum has won the round, and whoever has played the lowest card of this side wins these cards. (In a tie for lowest, the next lowest card of this side wins; if no cards of the winning side are unique, then the deck wins.) The winner stacks these cards and places a card of the winning side on top of this stack, then a new round begins.&#10;&#10;As soon as a side has won four times, the game ends with this side being victorious. Each player scores one point for each stack in front of them that shows this side and one point for each card of this side still in hand. Whoever has the most points wins! (Alternatively, play a number of games equal to the number of players and sum your points over those games.)&#10;&#10;RevoltaaA includes a &quot;bananas&quot; variant in which the face-down deck is not used and cards aren't played simultaneously. Instead one player leads a card face up, then each player lays down a card in turn, with the winner being chosen the same way and the first player breaking ties. The winner of one round leads the next, and points are scored as in the original game.&#10;&#10;",

During set-up, each player takes a set of tokens and two tiles, keeping them secret from other players; four tiles are turned face-up to form a communal pool.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player adds one or more tiles to the playing area from his personal area, the communal pool, or both locations. Each tile must be laid adjacent to at least one other tile in play, and the color of the tile must be next to the color of adjacent tiles on the color wheel. Thus, a green tile can be placed adjacent only to yellow or blue tiles, a red tile only next to orange and purple, and so on.&#10;&#10;If a player completes a hexagon &ndash; dubbed a &quot;wheel&quot; &ndash; on his turn, he marks the center of the hexagon with a token. A &quot;full wheel&quot; with all six colors is worth three points, a bi-colored wheel worth two points, and all other wheels worth one point each. To end a turn, a player optionally refills his hand up to two tiles, then adds new tiles to the communal pool to fill it to four.&#10;&#10;When all the tiles have been played, the game ends and the player with the highest score wins. Vizia includes five variant rules for advanced play that can be mixed-and-matched as desired, such as scoring a bonus for a player's largest group of tokens, removing a token from play in order to move a tile already on the board, and reducing the number of communal tiles (which lessens luck of the draw).&#10;&#10;",

The rules are in  Italian, German, English, French and Spanish (would that other publishers tried so hard!), but please note the English rules use the word 'card' for both tiles and cards.&#10;Players move their car by rolling a die and laying tiles to make the winding course (which includes garages to repair damage and refuel etc). But you also draw a card to your hand from which you offer a card to another player. Some are good (go ahead, pass, shortcut), others bad (wrong way, engine trouble, flat tire, breakdown). If they accept, they play the card on themselves; if they refuse, you play it on yourself.&#10;An odd mix of bluff and dice rolling, with little strategy. Works best with more players and children will enjoy it. The graphics are jolly and the game has 6 neat little metal roadsters. Worth a play, but don't chase this one down.&#10;&#10;",

(Ex: You can&rsquo;t say the word &ldquo;no&rdquo; and you can&rsquo;t refer to anyone by their first name.) Draw a card and follow the instructions. Start a story, rhyme a word, test your memory, name a celebrity, point left, answer a question with a question, and many more.&#10;&#10;The player whose turn it is, draws the top card from the MOOSE MASTER deck and places it face up on the table so that all players may read it.&#10;&#10;The player reads the card, performing the action immediately or following the instructions.&#10;&#10;Every player must keep a watchful eye and attentive ear on all other players. Here&rsquo;s why, when a card from the MOOSE MASTER deck is turned over, the last player to perform the action shown or the first player to incorrectly perform the described task receives a penalty. Penalties are recorded by taking a Penalty card and placing it face up in front of the offending player.&#10;&#10;There are two ways to play:&#10;ELIMINATION: Playing with the elimination rules, once a player accumulates 7 Penalty cards, they are eliminated from the game. The last two players remaining win.&#10;&#10;FEWEST PENALTIES: Play through the whole deck and the player with the fewest Penalty cards wins the game.&#10;&#10;Moose Master is a great ice breaker and turns any gathering into a great party. It&rsquo;s a must have for your college dorm, cabin and your family game library.&#10;&#10;",

It is still widely played today.&#10;&#10;Players push ('shove') polished coins (half pennies, traditionally) along a board which has been marked out in horizontal bands, called 'beds'. The most common method is to place the coin on the bottom edge of the board, slightly overhanging, and tap it with the heel of the hand. The aim of the game is to position coins within the beds, with no part touching the bands. This requires considerable skill.&#10;&#10;Players must get a coin in each bed three times. Each success is scored, often with a cribbage style peg and hole system up the side of the board or with chalk tallies.&#10;&#10;Boards are made of wood or slate.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Before Hitler. Before Napoleon. Another European strong-man invaded Russia&hellip; and came to grief. He was Charles XII of Sweden. In later years, they would call it &ldquo;The Great Northern War.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Whether the blame can tagged to Swedish expansionism or Peter the Great&rsquo;s desire for that warm-water capital city and &ldquo;window on Europe,&rdquo; the clash was a seemingly inevitable clash over who would own what in northern and eastern Europe and what shape Poland would take (if any). When the war started, it resembled something Frederick the Great would face, a &ldquo;everyone against one country&rdquo; conflict that saw Russia joined by Denmark/Norway and a Saxon-Poland-Lithuania combination, with others joining later, all seeking to take advantage of the 18-year old Charles XII&mdash;who was perceived to be weak and inexperienced. Like Frederick, he would parry multiple invasions and survive. Unlike Frederick, he would launch a serious invasion deep into Russia&hellip;and fall from power.&#10;&#10;A Thunder Upon the Land looks as the Sweden vs. Russia portion of this war, with the two battles that rather started and finished the conflict. The Battle of Narva took place in 1700, as Russia and a Saxon-Polish contingent aimed to push Sweden out of the Baltic, with the Saxons threatening Riga and the Russians besieging Narva. But it was November, and Peter left his army feeling secure that his 40,000 men could bottle up and capture the 2500 Swedes holding the city. Charles rushed to relieve the city with an army that was well-drilled and well equipped, but numbered only about 8000 men. So, including the troops in the city, he would be attacking at something like 1-4 odds. And attacking in a blizzard. But the surprise and wretched weather worked to his advantage, and virtually the entire Russian army was killed or captured, along with their artillery and equipment. It was Russia&rsquo;s finest force at the time, and an immediate invasion by Sweden might well have succeeded. But there was Riga and the Saxons to consider, and Charles let the moment pass.&#10;&#10;Three years later, having knocked the Saxons out of the war, Charles turned again to Russia, who had surprised Europe by founding St. Petersburg on what was then still Swedish territory. Charles aimed for Moscow, and this time, it was a Swedish army that vanished from the map.&#10;&#10;A Thunder Upon the Land brings you both battles of Narva and Poltava, with full color maps and over 250 die-cut counters. Each turn represents about one hour of real time and each hex represents about 500 yards. This game uses chit-draw for wing activation and allows players to make tactical choices like forming squares or deciding if their dragoons will press home charges or use the safer (but less effective) Carracole attacks, with optional rules for volley fire and desperation attacks.&#10;&#10;Can you, as Charles XII, maintain Sweden&rsquo;s status as the rising power in Europe? Can you, as Peter I, defeat the invaders and open the great city you gave your name to? The choices are yours as you refight the battles of Narva and Poltava.&#10;&#10;&#10;    Map - One double-sided full-color 22&quot;x34&quot; mapsheet&#10;    Counters - 264 full-color large 5/8&quot; diecut pieces&#10;    Rules length - 12 pages&#10;    Charts and tables - 2 pages&#10;    Complexity - Medium&#10;    Solitaire suitability - Average&#10;&#10;&#10;",

(Destination: Treasure Island) is formally a race game, but in fact you need to employ tactics to meet challenges, complete missions and earn victory points. Your decisions will largely influence your score, although elements of luck are also present in the game.&#10;&#10;2-4 pirate ships set to sea to reach Treasure Island ahead of the others. But being the first is not enough: the real winner will be the one who scores best in the various challenges on the way. &#10;The pirates (48 character cards) have certain skills of different strength which can be boosted by using the appropriate weapons and tools (24 weapon cards). The set of cards held by players in hand continuously changes as cards are played and replaced during actions. This determines the actual power of a player&rsquo;s crew when facing a particular challenge.  Playing the cards tactfully can earn considerable advantage and valuable treasures for players, which will improve their final score.&#10;&#10;The game starts with an empty board and a series of blank fields on the sea, leading to Treasure Island. As the ships move ahead, the board is gradually filled with event cards randomly drawn, all indicating an action. Players will gather and sell pearls, trade with weapons, spy out and occupy islands, collect treasures, complete various missions or even kidnap other&rsquo;s sailors.  Often they master their skills to compete against each other or fight the forces of nature.&#10;&#10;The winner will be the player who achieves the most victory points by sailing fast, completing missions and having a valuable collection of treasures.&#10;&#10;Description from the publisher:&#10;Ir&aacute;ny a Kincses Sziget!&#10;Verseng&eacute;s &eacute;s k&uuml;zdelem a tengeren&#10;&#10;Az Ir&aacute;ny a Kincses sziget! formailag egy versenyj&aacute;t&eacute;k, de a gy&#197;&#145;zelemhez j&oacute; taktik&aacute;ra &eacute;s n&eacute;mi szerencs&eacute;re is sz&uuml;ks&eacute;g van. &#10;N&eacute;h&aacute;ny kal&oacute;zhaj&oacute; nagy zs&aacute;km&aacute;ny rem&eacute;ny&eacute;ben nekiv&aacute;g a tengernek, hogy a t&ouml;bbiek el&#197;&#145;tt &eacute;rjen el a Kincses szigetre.

Any player may call for a guess after this turn. If they do, the pixie draws a flower card from the deck and places it next to them to track the number of guesses, then each player writes down and reveals their guess. If anyone is correct, the round ends, with the correct guesser scoring 1 point for every two cards remaining in the deck and the pixie scoring 2 points per guess. If no one is correct, the next player takes their turn, with players taking turns until someone guesses correctly or the deck has fewer than two cards remaining.&#10;&#10;After everyone has been pixie once, whoever has scored the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

Moby Dick prevails by destroying the whaleship Pequod, while Ahab won't rest until the white whale of his nightmares is slain.&#10;&#226;&#128;&#139;&#10;Leviathan offers players a simple set of rules but a rich wargame flavor in about 15 minutes and is highly portable. This is a great piece of introductory level naval combat for both new and experienced gamers across the age spectrum, and a wonderful homage to two of literature's most notorious monsters.&#10;&#10;",

The initial (physical) release was crowd funded and contains the first set of 200 cards.&#10;&#10;In this fantasy world of the Shadow creatures have fallen over the realm of mankind. The player assumes the role of a powerful character on either side and fights his enemies using a customized deck of cards.&#10;&#10;Each deck contains a hero card with a different special ability and number of hit points. A player loses the game when his character's life drops to zero. Each turn players may sacrifice a card from their hand to build their resources and then use those resources to play cards or execute abilities. Cards can be allies with which to attack the opposing side, abilities such as spells and items including weapons and armor.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "&quot;Black stories: Stadt-Land-Tod&quot; is a very fast game that can be played with at least 2 players. Theoretically an unlimited number of players can join the game - the only limiting factor is the number of pencils and sheets of paper you have at hand.&#10;&#10;In each round a letter is randomly determined. Then each player writes down a substantive for each word category that start with the determined letter.&#10;&#10;The categories are (among others): Place of murder, weapon, escape vehicle. They are predetermined on the sheets that come with the game.&#10;&#10;The first player who manages to find a word for each category stops the round and the results from all players are compared.&#10;&#10;For each word a player wrote he gets points: 5 if other players wrote the same word / 10 if no one else thought of this word.&#10;&#10;Example: &#10;Random letter: C&#10;&#10;Anna wrote for the category &quot;escape vehicle&quot;: car&#10;Bob wrote: cab&#10;Roy wrote: car&#10;&#10;Anna and Roy get 5 points each. Bob gets 10 points.&#10;&#10;After this the next round begins.&#10;&#10;The game can continue as long as the players agree on.&#10;Finally all points are summarized and the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;This game is the &quot;black stories&quot; variant of a classical game called &quot;Stadt, Land, Fluss&quot; (City, Country, River) which is played by almost every child in Germany (e.g. at school during breaks).&#10;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;============================From the publisher website:&#10;&#10;Duisburg, D&auml;nemark und Donau waren gestern- in dieser bltur&uuml;nstigen Version des Klassikers &quot; Stadt Land Fluss&quot; geht es um Mordmotive, Tatwaffen und Fluchtfahrzeuge.&#10;50 Blatt mit Spielanleitung&#10;&#10;Translation:&#10;&#10;Duisburg, D&auml;nemark and Donau were yesterday - in this bloodthirsty edition of the German classic &quot;Stadt, Land, Fluss&quot; (categories) it's all about murder reasons, weapons and escape vehicles. &#10;50 playing sheets and manual&#10;&#10;",

In each round players take one card, may play a special action, then add the card to their collection. Each card is divided in three segments and shows only part of a painting &mdash; at least one quarter of it, half at most.&#10;&#10;The aim of the game is to choose which parts of the cards to connect and when and how use the special one-time actions.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Five-up is a point Traditional Games: Dominoes game in the &quot;Fives Family&quot; of Traditional Games: Dominoes games played with a standard Western Dominoes set of 28 tiles.  This variation adds the ends of the dominoes to make a multiple of five for scoring. Five-up is very similar to other games such as All Fives, Muggins, and Sniff.&#10;&#10;In Five-up, each player starts out with five dominoes in their hand, and the first player can play any domino in their hand.  Thereafter, each player must play a domino from their hand if they can match it to a domino end on the table.  If they cannot play a domino from their hand, they must draw from the &quot;boneyard&quot; until they can play a domino on the tableau.  If the ends of the dominoes add up to a multiple of five, the player adding the domino scores one (1) point for each multiple of five (5) (IE: if the ends added up to ten (10), the player would score two (2) points).  The first player that plays their last domino from their hand, adds up the count remaining in their opponent's hand and scores the total divided by five (5) (IE: if the opponent had a count of fifteen (15) in their hand, the scorer would score three (3) points).&#10;&#10;Five-up is played to a score of 61, and is usually played with a Cribbage board to keep score.&#10;&#10;Five-up is unique in that every double domino played is a possible &quot;spinner,&quot; and plays can be played on all four sides of a &quot;spinner.&quot;&#10;&#10;The rules for Five-Up were standardized and popularized in the 60's by Dominic C. Armanino, who wrote at least four books on Dominoes. He was a strong advocate and PR agent for this version of the game.  Life magazine called this version, A big new go for the humble domino.&#10;&#10;",
