    "description": "Splash Attack is a fast reaction game in which players must quickly react to the roll of the dice. The game comes with several chunky wooden fish in three different colors, with three of each color of fish, each having a different design on them consisting of either squares, circles, or triangles.&#10;&#10;On each turn, someone rolls the two special dice. One die has colored faces, and the other die has shapes. Players look at the die roll and quickly grab the matching fish from the table! For example, if blue and square is rolled, you would want to grab the blue fish with squares on it.&#10;&#10;However, if a player already has the matching fish in his play area, the players yell &quot;Splash Attack!&quot; and grab the red piranha. If the player that already had the matching fish is the first to do this, he gets to permanently keep the fish as a point. If a different player is quickest, however, the player loses the fish back to the center of the table. Thus, you must be the quickest to react to a matching pattern twice in a row to score. The first player to score three fish wins!&#10;&#10;",

Every turn a player picks a tile and connects it with the tiles already on the table and then moves his/her pawn if desired or possible.  Players attempt to keep their paths open and to block or trap their opponents with strategic placement of the wall tiles.  After the fourth exterior corner tile has been placed, tiles may be replaced as well as placed, and the exit tile is shuffled into the draw pile.  The first player to the exit tile when it appears scores zero points.  Every other player gets points depending on how far their pawn is when the exit is reached by anyone.

The battlefield, divided by hills and streams, became known as Austerlitz and would be celebrated as Napoleon&rsquo;s greatest victory.&#10;&#10;After fierce fighting amid the morning mists, the sun broke through the clouds. The French stormed the key Pratzen Heights, and after a bloody bayonet fight with the Russian troops manning the lines forced the Allied army into a disorganized retreat.&#10;&#10;The 34&quot;x22&quot; map features not hexagons but irregular-sized areas which relate to the actual topography of the area being depicted.  198 counters in two sizes (2/3&quot; square and 1 and 1/3&quot;x2/3&quot; long pieces) depict the infantry, cavalry, artillery units and the leaders so necessary in this activation system; the better leaders activate their troops more readily and more often.&#10;&#10;This is a new rules set , bearing some resemblance to the earlier Napoleonic games by Avalanche Press, but also borrowing from their War of the States and Rome At War series.&#10;&#10;",

These cards are played on your turn and are used to move or exchange a partner figure. There are 3 different types of sympathy cards: the cards with the numbers are used to move the corresponding colord figure on the board; the cards with an arrow moves the corresponding piece forward to the space of another playing piece; finally the cards with the text are played and the actions carried out immediately.  Alternatively, each numbered or arrowed sympathy card can be used to exchange partner cards with another player.&#10;&#10;The game starts with a player playing a numbered Sympathy Card and moving the corresponding piece forward that number of spaces, then drawing a new card. The next player then takes his turn, etc. Play continues in this manner - moving or swapping pieces until a player is able to get to the finish (7th Heaven) while holding the correct colored partner card for his playing piece. If no-one makes it to 7th Heaven, the game ends when the last sympathy card is played. The winner in that case is the player with the correct partner card who is closest to 7th Heaven.&#10;&#10;",

Many civilizations were already on the brink of collapse, and had already left their deteriorating home worlds behind in search of resources, peace, and solidarity.&#10;&#10;As new civilizations arrived in the TAU CETI system, they settled among the planets, terraforming them into more hospitable worlds. With this mass migration a new alliance was quickly formed, known as the TAU CETI Authority, which encouraged diplomacy among the different cultures and emerged as the new economic power.&#10;&#10;Trade began, with each civilization utilizing their strengths and comparative advantages to maximize productivity. Heralded among the civilizations, a sense of friendship, economic prosperity and peace enriched the star system.&#10;&#10;But all is not well. Soon after forming the alliance, unprecedented crises afflicted the colonized planets, causing civil unrest and economic disharmony. The fragile new alliance&rsquo;s existence is now being threatened!

Once your King has become completely surrounded by pyramids and cannot move, you are out of the game, unless there are two pyramids of the same color (there are eight pyramids in five different colors) leading out in a straight line from your King, in which case you can move the one closest to your King to anywhere else on the board, and then move your King into the empty space.&#10;&#10;Oddly, the box this game came in is completely devoid of any extraneous info (including game designer and year of publication), and even the manufacturer's initials are in tiny print with a &copy; symbol, crammed down in the corner of the cover.

The ninjas succeed by the clever use of special dice, exciting action cards, and real ninja stars. Fight in the dojo and defeat the opposing warriors with ninja dice! A mix of strategy, action and luck decides which ninjas will claim victory in the end!&#10;&#10;This game is reminiscent of Stratego. The game is played on a 5x8 board. Each player has fifteen ninjas: nine 1-star ninjas, five 2-star ninjas, and one Soke.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, each player places his ninjas on the three rows on his side of the board, in any formation he likes. The type of ninja (Soke, 2-star or 1-star) is hidden from the opponent.&#10;Each turn, a player has zero to three moves; the exact amount is determined at random, using so-called weapon cards. He can use these moves to move one or more ninjas. If he moves a ninja into a square occupied by an opponent, a battle ensues. Each player rolls a die for his ninja. Higher level ninjas roll better dice: a 1-star ninja rolls a six-sided die, a 2-star ninja rolls an eight-sided die and a Soke rolls a twelve sided die. The ninja whose owner rolls the highest defeats the opposing ninja, which is removed from the game.&#10;&#10;The players can further influence the game by means of five action cards, which give special bonuses, and ninja stars, which allow a player to reroll his combat die.&#10;&#10;",

So thematically, it's neat, but what I most remember about it are the various &quot;no dice&quot; movement systems.&#10;&#10;All players start with their pieces &quot;clicked in&quot; to a spinner in the middle of the board, which, when spun, randomly puts each player in front of one of the six paths. On your turn, you can get off and attempt that path, or spin again, possibly rearranging you - and everyone else.&#10;&#10;Each path has its own movement system. A few of them are flip-a-tiles, with each tile set having movement from 1-5 on them. Health has a bicycle theme, with one wheel being the tiles and the other wheel being the discard pile. Self Improvement tiles were books in a bookcase.&#10;&#10;The Love path has an arrow-through-a-heart spinner, with the arrow pointing to your movement, 1-4. Two other paths also have themed spinners.&#10;&#10;But the coolest of them was the Friendship path. The Hand of Friendship is a seesaw hand with a little marble in the &quot;wrist&quot; and when you seesaw it, the marble &quot;pachinko's&quot; into one of the five fingers, each having a different movement number 1-5.&#10;&#10;When you finish a path - and they have text on some of the squares (&quot;start over&quot; &quot;get a hang-up&quot; &quot;move forward&quot; etc.) - you click back in to the spinner and hope you land on the next path you need.&#10;&#10;",

They try to guide their ships to the most advantageous cities, and find the best crews to sail them. Each successful unloading of goods in a city earns the player silver, and the game ends on the round someone reaches 100 silver marks.&#10;&#10;The game is set in 16th century Europe, and revolves around choosing the best routes for your ship, finding the best crews to get there the fastest, and planning for the future. Loading Cards are revealed to show what products are available in which cities, and Unloading Cards show which cities are buying what products. A further future card of both kinds is also revealed, to show the players what's coming. Old cards go out at the end of a round, and new ones come in instead.&#10;&#10;Each round all players choose a new crew for their ship. The first player token rotates over the rounds, and the last player is stuck with the only crew that is left. Each card shows a movement number, and an expertise either in coastal sailing or open sea. However, the choice of crew is not always obvious; the lowest movement number will move first, and the highest moves last. Any ties are solved with the first player token. During a turn, a player can freely move their ship between ports, load it for a fee and unload it for a reward. The faster a ship reaches a port for unloading, the greater the profit will be. The player with the most money when the game ends, wins!&#10;&#10;",

The problem is there aren't enough available in total for more than one company to achieve that goal.  You win by assembling a full staff and making it safely around to a New Fiscal Year (the &quot;Go&quot; square, in other words).&#10;&#10;As you move about the (bilingual, two-sided) board, you'll have opportunities to hire or raid competing companies.  You must decide how much to pay your people --not enough and they'll switch companies, too much and your company will go bankrupt.  Managing your money is an important aspect of the game but it isn't the victory condition.&#10;&#10;Amusingly, the early editions had all-female secretaries and all-male higher personnel; later editions kept the illustrations but shuffled them throughout the positions.&#10;&#10;From Waddington ad: &quot;Ulcers is the big business game that recognizes an important business fact: PEOPLE are among a company's most valuable assets. And people are why executives get ULCERS. Suppose you had to form a company and had to hire a staff of executives, managers,salesmen and secretaries. You probably think it would be easy but it isn't. ULCRES puts you in the owners chair. You form the company, hire the staff and you try to keep them.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

The game is packaged in a wedge (&quot;piece-of-pie&quot;) shaped box.&#10;&#10;The game does not feature a game board, and thus, there is no roll-and-move mechanic. Instead, players roll the color-coded die, and answers a question matching the color rolled. If a player correctly answers a question, he may &quot;go for a wedge&quot; by answering another question in the same category. If he does so, he keeps that card. If the player answers a question incorrectly, it is the next player's turn. Play ends when a player has collected six cards/correctly answered 12 questions.&#10;&#10;",

If the property is not owned then the player purchases it for free!&#10;2.    Magic Moments and Show Time cards replace Chance and Community Chest and are pleasantly well-themed.&#10;3.    Gameboard spaces contain the Disney films as the properties you are buying.  In the center of the board is a magnificent pop-up Disney-style castle.&#10;4.    Stations have been replaced by modes of transport (including Mr Incredible&rsquo;s car).  The &lsquo;stations&rsquo; are linked by a &lsquo;pixie dust trail&rsquo;.  If a player ends their turn on a station they can choose to move to the next station (using up one point of their dice roll) and so on to move around the board quicker (and to avoid paying rent!).&#10;5.    The traditional houses and hotels have been replaced with Fairytale Cottages and Sleeping Beauty castles.&#10;6.

The crew cards also have effects which give players the opportunity to take actions in addition to providing their value towards winning the encounter.  Players who judge their hands to be strong based on their values and/or abilities can bet on them in order to increase the reward for winning.  For players unsure of their hand, but who still want to play the abilities of their crew, they can take a loan token worth minus 2 and still stay in the hand.  Players who have less confidence in their crews may fold to avoid risking their own precious gold.&#10;&#10;By winning encounters players may claim treasures and items which give them special abilities and the gold necessary to win the game.  The airship pirate who has claimed the most gold at the end of the game receives the title of Pirate Admiral and declares victory over the competition.&#10;&#10;",

Your goal is simple: turn as many mall shoppers as you can into zombies. Achieving your goal is not simple. Human Heroes attempt to put you down permanently and the roaming horde of your victims is trying to eat up your food supply.&#10;&#10;We Are Dead is for 2-5 people ages 13+ and plays in about an hour.&#10;&#10;Art for the game was done by two amazing artists, Mike Morris and Mike Collins. I cannot rave enough about how well they brought the vision for this game to life (or unlife).&#10;&#10;Players take turns attempting to attack the mall shoppers trying to satisfy their recently unlocked hunger for humans. Players will use attack cards from their hands and infection tokens they receive to defeat heroes and turn the humans.&#10;&#10;During other players' turns each opponent will have the opportunity to play hero cards in the hopes of stopping the player. This interaction during other players' turns reduces down time and keeps all players engaged in the game.&#10;&#10;While players are busy with their own struggles, the horde grows from their victims. When the Horde! card appears the players must work together to make sure they do not all lose to the massive horde.&#10;&#10;We Are Dead is easy to learn, but provides enough depth and random elements to allow for good replay-ability. The game uses a hand management mechanic with elements of co-op play and resource management that add layers of strategy to the game.&#10;&#10;",

Mint Control is designed by the same designer as Mint Works and Mint Delivery as a deep strategy meets ease-of-play area control game that fits in your pocket, teaches in under a minute and plays in 30! It expands the world of these games such that these candy companies are now starting to vie for control.&#10;&#10;Each player has five influence tokens that are placed onto buildings (that represent presence and potentially control).  The first person to play all influence tokens ends the game.  For each location, the player who has control of that location (determined by having more influence tokens than each other player), earns the victory points associated with that location (represented by stars in the top-right corner).  During play, if a player has presence on a card, they can use the actions on the cards by paying their cost.  These are effects like: kicking other players out of a location, taking more mints, and placing influence tokens.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "'Crazy Farmers And The Cl&ocirc;tures Electriques' is a strong emerging strategy game (2p) which tends to be more lightweight and chaotic in 3-4p (better around a table with friends and a good drink in this mode). In any case it&rsquo;s a game with a pinch of &laquo; take that &raquo; and cutthroat maneuvers where you&rsquo;ll get to experience the best UFC games ever. As you may wonder, UFC stands for Ultimate Farming Championship. In 2042, the European Union has long since cut off financial aid to farmers. In order to get out of this situation, farmers created a competition for the installation of electric fences, which very quickly attracted the attention of the public and sponsors.&#10;&#10;So now is the time for you to enter the arena and become the best electric fence installer. During your turn, move your tractor along the paths on the board. Place electric fences behind you. As soon as you surround a plot with your fences, take control of it. As soon as you control a certain number of plots (depending on the number of players), you win the game. However, it will not be that simple. You will need to be on the lookout, as your opponents will try to stop you by cutting your electric fences or playing event cards...&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

After the events are resolved, the players bid for the resources. Then the active player uses his action points and resources to acquire building permits, acquire tools or erect buildings which differ in their resource costs and advantages conferred. Bandits may also be used to further the player's goal, but may backfire if the dice are not friendly. Then players engage in a subgame somewhat akin to Blackjack -- but with a greater range of results -- to distribute gold useful for the next auction. What's tricky is to take in more gold diggers than anyone else, but not to take so many that the ensuing brawl wipes out all of the profits. The eventual winner is the player who has managed to construct the best set of buildings with bonuses for achieving multiple buildings of the same type. This player is elected Mayor of Goldrush City.&#10;&#10;Created by the designer of Strand-Cup.&#10;&#10;",

Lucrative advertising contracts are needed for you to profit from your media operations, but they bore and repel your audiences, requiring you to balance profit and sustainability at all times&#10;&#10;Each turn is divided in multiple phases: the business phase, the media phase, the advertising phase, the boredom phase and the mogul phase.&#10;&#10;In the business phase, players must select two actions to branch out into new media outlets, break into new continents and secure advertising contracts. They may purchase a media outlet, draw a media card, invest in their outlets or confirm advertising contracts. Once every player has chosen two actions, the process is repeated twice more. In the media phase, players bid for the attention of patrons on different continents and receive awards according to their global and specific media performance on each continent. Bids are made using permanent content bought for each player's office in the first phase (investment) and temporary content from media cards. To maintain an outlet, players must meet minimum content requirements. In the advertising phase, players earn revenue through advertising from patrons they've attracted. In the boredom phase, players lose patrons from their office according to a pre-determined pattern found on the turn order track. In the mogul phase, the turn order marker is advanced, face up cards are changed and the leading mogul marker is passed to the next player.&#10;&#10;The game ends once the media deck has run out twice or if the turn marker reaches the end of the turn track. The winner is the player with the greatest media value.&#10;&#10;",

To win, find out who did it, where, when, how, and why.&quot;&#10;&#10;This is a card game that shares some similarities with Clue, but adds some other questions to the mix, like what time of day did it happen, and what was the killer's motive? To the usual process of elimination and deduction found in most Clue-type games, they've added scoring elements.  You can collect sets of clues and reveal them to score points.  Obviously, though, this aids the other players as well by eliminating some categories.&#10;&#10;You start with a number of cards, each of which contains a specific clue. As play progresses, you can attempt to accumulate all the clues in a category, which will earn you points based on what turn you choose to reveal your set.&#10;&#10;Each turn, you are allowed to direct a question to a specific player.  The question must be answerable with a number.  For example, you may ask &quot;How many Cookie Carpenter cards do you have?&quot;  or  &quot;How many Jealousy cards have you seen?&quot;  Doing this will help you eliminate some of the icons (clues) on your score sheet.&#10;&#10;Your other option during your turn is to make an accusation. You need to be careful though, since this also will end the game! On the other hand, you do get some bonus points for being the First Accuser.&#10;&#10;Cards are passed after each player's turn. For the first round it is only one, but it increases by 1 for every round the game lasts.&#10;&#10;Once someone decides to accuse, all players can make any guesses they want to, filling in the answers they've come up with for each category (Suspect, Place, Weapon, Emotion).  You can also fill in the specific answer within a category for more points. The problem with guessing, though, is that wrong answers result in negative points, and the First Accuser loses double!&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Around 1300, a supernatural event opened a few breaches between two distant worlds: ours and the world of FATAL. Following this event, the Queen of Fatal disappeared, and a few enchanters left that world and arrived on Earth.&#10;&#10;The five breaches in Europe gave origin to as many magic birth-signs: Flambeaux (Paris), Aquat&eacute; (Brno), Terranova (Rome), &Aring;ngb&aring;t (Tallinn), Lichtenborn (Nuremberg). Five families who over the centuries kept wavering between open war and armed peace, but who never lived in harmony.&#10;&#10;Since then, the enchanters have influenced humans politics, arts, and science: either directly or by inspiring and taking control over all humans who were useful for their cause, and FATAL is a piece of this tale.&#10;&#10;The game features a deck of 110 cards. Each player belongs to one of the birth-signs and tries to catch the greatest number of treasures by playing &quot;trimagics&quot; (combination of three cards) and/or beating other players.&#10;&#10;During his turn, the player:&#10;&#10;     may play a special &quot;enchantment&quot; card,&#10;     may steal a card in front of another player (with a rock-paper-scissors system printed on the cards),&#10;     may play up to two cards in front of himself.&#10;&#10;&#10;Each player has two &quot;virtual&quot; columns where he can play cards: the first card of a column is played normally, the second card is played rotated by 180&deg;, the third card completes the column (the &quot;trimagic&quot;) and must be placed rotated by 90&deg;.&#10;The three cards of a tri-spell have a different meaning: the first card decides the performed action, the second one fixes the number of targets or the power of the spell, the third one closes the trimagic.&#10;&#10;Each player has also a designed enemy (by secret role assignment at the start of the game): if he defeats this player, he is the winner. If nobody reaches this goal, the winner is the player with the most powerful treasures at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;",

Redakai cards have Blast 3D technology, making them appear 3D, as well as making attacks appear to animate as the player moves the card.&#10;&#10;In Redakai, a player is trying to eliminate the character(s) controlled by the opponent to win the game. In the basic game, each player starts with one character and on a turn you draw a card from your deck, then play it immediately. The card types are monster &ndash; which are played on your own character to boost defenses and heal damage &ndash; and attack &ndash; which are played on the opponent's character. A character can have defenses in three colors &ndash; green, red, blue &ndash; and if an attack is stronger than a character's defense in that attack's color, then the attack hits and damages the character.&#10;&#10;The cards are transparent and they stack on top of each other during play. A character's health is represented by three damage zones on the card, and if all these zones turn red (by playing one or more attacks on that character), then the character is eliminated. An attack can also cover up and remove a character's defense, while monsters can boost defenses and cover red damage zones with yellow ones, thus healing the character.&#10;&#10;In the advance game, each player controls three characters and starts with a hand of three cards and a maximum Kairu value of three. Each turn, a player boosts his maximum Kairu by one (to a maximum of 20), draws one card, then (optionally) plays monster and attack cards, spending Kairu to do so equal to the cost on each card. Some cards have &quot;react&quot; abilities that allow you to spend Kairu to defend against attacks. At the start of each turn, your Kairu refreshes to its maximum value.&#10;&#10;If you eliminate all three of your opponent's characters, you win the game. If you cannot draw a card on your turn because your deck is exhausted, you lose.&#10;&#10;",
