    "description": "A trivia game developed in cooperation with the Finnish Donald Duck magazine. The questions have a heavy emphasis on stories by Carl Barks and Don Rosa.&#10;&#10;Each player starts from a different location in Duckburg and is given a personal route card. The route card lists four other places the player has to visit in the given order. The winner is the first player who manages to visit all his locations, and then snatch the Number One Dime from the other players and return it to the Money Bin.&#10;&#10;Every turn a player has an allowance of five action points. These can be used for moving, answering trivia questions, or using the spinner. Correct answers give you action cards, which are usually very beneficial. The spinner might give you more action points.&#10;&#10;Question categories&#10;Pictures (Red) - the questions in this category are about the picture on the other side of the question card.&#10;Donald &amp; Co (Blue) - these are questions about the inhabitants of Duckburg, their likes and dislikes, hobbies, enemies and much more.&#10;Stories (Green) - these questions concern classic stories from the Donald Duck comic books.&#10;This and That (Yellow) - this category comprises of miscellaneous questions about the world of Donald Duck.&#10;&#10;Conducted in cooperation with the editorial of Donald Duck.&#10;&#10;",

Money can be earned at bank.&#10;All roads, railroads, forests and buildings are neutral.&#10;Additionally, each 1 and 6 rolled for movement result in a  card drawn from random events deck.&#10;Unique mechanic allows one to build a safe house for storage of found parts and possessions.&#10;Interesting system of randomly &quot;dropping&quot; helicopter parts and players on their starting positions on the island.&#10;&#10;Despite poor production quality of the gaming elements (board was the exception) the game has interesting gameplay, powerful marketing campaign (tv commercials) and was very popular at the time. &#10;There was a poster included with the game (on the poster: bigger version of box cover).&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "A collectible card game (CCG) where players take the part of an owner/coach of a professional (United States) football team and play a football game vs each other.&#10;&#10;It uses a built play deck reminiscent of other CCG games, and that same play deck is used as both a timer and an indicator of results for the games called offensive and defensive plays.&#10;&#10;The opponents match decks versus each other, as well as a lineup of face-up starters on each side of the &quot;ball.&quot;&#10;&#10;Each coach calls a play simultaneously, and results of the combination of the plays and the performance of the individual player(s) involved are checked also.&#10;&#10;The Play wheel chart makes this quite efficient.  Base gamers, who do not have this wheel are left to consult a chart which cross-references the results.  The Play wheel streamlines the game--and decreases the down time significantly.&#10;&#10;The game is played in quarters like in regular football, timed by the use of a time-deck.  Coaches can implement double-teams, and run trick plays versus the other.&#10;&#10;The offensive plays available in the expansion set was significant to opening up the play books for each coach, including never-before-seen plays on both sides of the ball.  Additionally, certain players were hybrid players.&#10;&#10;The most notable of these was the Kordell Stewart card which we used to call &quot;slash&quot; like his on the field nickname:  Because he is a QB/WR/RB, and has stats which are superlative for all three positions.  This makes him a valuable asset to any team.&#10;&#10;Special Rare and Ultra-Rare cards allowed special abilities or results to be played from the hand of either coach, assisting in particular offensive and defensive plays.  Some cards also result in penalties, fumbles, interceptions, and big plays.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Firefly: Shiny Dice lasts three rounds, and whoever has the most points after three rounds wins. In each round, each player takes one or more turns. On your first turn in a round, you roll all fifteen dice &mdash; seven crew dice (brown), three passenger dice (white), and five bad guy dice (black) &mdash; then place them in the appropriate places on your display. Crew members and passengers all have unique abilities, some of which involve the option of rerolling dice.&#10;&#10;After any rerolls, you reveal your mission for the round. If you have dice on your board that match the numbers given at the top of the mission, then you're unaffected by the bold line &mdash; Bushwhacked, Gorram, etc. &mdash; immediately underneath. Otherwise, you might be forced to end your go after the current turn, forced to take an additional turn, or affected in some other way. After revealing and resolving the mission, the bad guys strike:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Each Badger die holds one supply die.&#10;    Each Saffron die moves a crew/passenger die of your choice to the cargo hold.&#10;    If Niska dice are present, KO a crew/passenger die of your choice.&#10;&#10;&#10;After this, you then use any remaining crew and passenger dice to defeat the bad guys, which generally require one point of damage to defeat. Remove them all, and you score 1 VP for each type of bad guy defeated, with half-points for each supply delivered; fail to remove them, and you score no points for the defeated bad guys. If you clear the turn, you can opt to take another turn &mdash; rolling all the bad guy dice and all non-KOed crew and passenger dice &mdash; or end your turn. If you opt to continue, but then fail to defeat the bad guys, you lose all the VP that you earned previously on that turn.&#10;&#10;After three rounds, whoever has the most VPs wins.&#10;&#10;",

In the Ancient World ('Kingdoms and AntiKingdoms Division Age), the Summoners (you) own several decks. The basic one is the Duel Stack that consists mostly of Figures  and Characters which belong to the Eragra Saga as well as several new Card Leagues such as Ploys Ad Hoc (Artefacts n' Constructions), Relics, Walls, Incantations and many other. The next 2 Stacks are the Mastery (10 cards) and the Grim (15 cards) one where you must Unfold, meaning you cannot use them from the beginning of the Duel. The rest of the cards form a Common Space which can be used by all the Summoners! There, a War of Incantations and Artefacts take place and the most powerful combinations with Minions wins&#10;&#10;Purpose in the Ancient World is to send as many Rival Minions as you can, to Limbo, in order to collect as many as you can from your Crystals (max. 25). The next step is to enter the Future World which can be done by activating 1 specific card from your Mastery Stack, a Vortex called Cyberspace. You can enter there any time you want but will you have enough Crystals? If you enter the Future World, then the rest Summoners must follow you with the Crystals they have collected from the first phase. Tough balance? No, the game in the Future World is totally different and much faster. In this world all change, so the rules.&#10;&#10;&#10;     The Future Stack is divided in 4 parts. Each Summoner owns a Stack of 30 cards. The cards you handle here are Viruses, Machines, Weapons, Ambushes, Resources &amp; Future Survivors. Here you use your collected Crystals. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Each Future card has the sing of a Crystal along with a number. For example you may have a Hybrid Machine and on it the Crystal sing and the number 3. Since you activate this card, place the equivalent Crystals on it. That means, your rivals have to beat this card thrice. Following this way, this Machine will be destroyed. Each time the rival wins a small battle, you remove a Crystal from your card and gives it to him. This world is faster since the Machines are moving in each round and carry dangerous tools capable of the ultimate destruction.. here the Duel here may last...few minutes!! &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Final Goal' of the Duel is to remove by any mean the Crystals from your rival(s) or to destroy their Future Survivor (there are 4 Future Survivors (1 for each one of you): A Hacker, a Cybermage, a Rebel and a member of the Torrius Syndicate who are protected by your Machines). &#10;&#10;&#10;In this game you will find more and more things to discover while you play. The point is to combine your cards well. You will enjoy it more, if you play with more than 1 rival and then you will face the brutality of Eragra. You can create Alliances with a rival Summoner to defeat another, but at the same time you must defeat your ally too. Your only true ally is your Minions. Are you ready?&#10;&#10;",

Player rings may only be placed where a legal partial path leads from the player's own base post. If an opponent undermines this path, the player's rings are removed from the board.&#10;&#10;The game is dynamic, deeply strategic, and highly competitive.

Each player must keep their children alive and sane through the night.&#10;&#10;The school bus sat waiting in front of the fairgrounds. Children from all parts of Harlington County were excited to start their trip, eager to see the Blue Mountain Campground on its opening weekend.  It was late evening when the Mayor wished the kids luck as they rose from their picnic tables, hurriedly shoving bits of cake into their mouths as they climbed aboard the old school bus.  Songs and the laughter of children would fill the first few hours, only to be cut short when one of the children called out &quot;I just saw a dark man standing in the road ahead of us.&quot;  As the laughter subsided and the children strained their eyes to see into the darkness, tree limbs burst through the windows, sending tiny glass fragments into the air that found their way into the soft flesh of the children. Metal groaned and cried out as the bus pitched over onto its side, sliding before finally ending up in a ditch on the side of the road. Screams echoed out of the interior of the bus as the children begun moving and freeing themselves from the wreckage. The driver lay dead against the wheel. It was almost midnight, and the children were alone in woods that could swallow them from every angle. It would be daybreak before anyone would even begin looking for them...&#10;&#10;Players choose 1 card from the six gifted children cards and 4 random cards from the 24 children and assemble their survivors. Each child card displays the child's name, age, sanity level and &quot;end game&quot; point value. Your goal is to keep as many children alive and as sane as possible by sunrise. The gifted children have high sanity values and a special ability to help their group survive. These special abilities include the power to absorb a creature&rsquo;s damage, evade enemy attacks and even pass damage meant for you onto your opponent's survivors. Survival is key and differs from child to child. Some kids are young and low on sanity, while others may have increased sanity due to age or street smarts. Each child card contains a simple descriptive term like Bully, Class Clown, or Doll Baby to give insight into each child and add flavor to the core game.&#10;&#10;The goal of Zero Hour is to survive from midnight until dawn. Each turn, a card from the Hour deck is flipped over, advancing time forward by one hour. The player with the highest point total at sunrise is declared the winner.  Each child has a point value indicated on their card that comes into play once the game is over.  Each player adds together whatever cards they are still holding to determine their point value total. This number will be between 0-25 points.&#10;&#10;The Game contains:&#10;6 Gifted Child cards&#10;24 Child cards &#10;30 Sanity cards&#10;8 Clock cards&#10;1 black/white Creature die&#10;1 white Escape die&#10;1 rules booklet &#10;100-card Exploration Deck (The Slender Man)&#10;&#10;",

Avoid getting wet by playing cards such as Powder Ball and Bad Aim that affect your opponent's chance to hit.  With the roll of a die and a little luck, you'll send your opponents home for hot chocolate and to change out of their soaked clothes.&#10;&#10;This game is basically a &quot;take-that&quot; style card game where players take turns targeting each other with various &quot;damage&quot; inflicting snowball cards and rolling a die to see if you hit.  Targets can defend by playing various cards that affect the die roll and sometimes allow a counter-attack.  Much more friendly for young children than similar games such as (e.g.) Lunch Money.  Most clever aspect of the design is the round snowball-shaped cards.&#10;&#10;",

So one morning he summoned his children.  &quot;I am prepared to hand over the kingdom to one of you.&quot;, he said. &quot;But first, you must pass a test --the same test I passed, and my father before me, and my grandmother before him.  You must go out into the land and find four Jewels of Justice and a crown which I have hidden.  You must uncover the Ruby of Love, Emerald of Faith, Sapphire of Wisdom, Amethyst of Truth and the Crown of Enlightenment.  The first of you who finds these precious objects and brings them to me will have demonstrated worthiness.  This is the one who will rule the kingdom&quot;.  Not wanting to be recognised by their enemies and delayed in their quest, the children disguised themselves as sage old men.  And, leaving the safety of the castle, they ventured out into the world --each with a guardian dragon, each hoping to be the one who returned with the four Jewels of justice and the fabulous Crown of Enlightenment.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to find a Crown of Enlightenment and one of each color of the four Jewels of Justice and return to home base with them.  The first player to do so inherits the kingdom and wins the game.&#10;&#10;The rules include several variants.&#10;&#10;Also included are rules for &quot;Emperor's Chess&quot;, which is considerably different, and two more two-player games (The Emperor's Secret and Sage &amp; Dragon Sets).&#10;&#10;Lovely bits.&#10;&#10;",

The hunters must work together to maximize their skills to search the surrounding waters and locate the shark before it can bring more terror to the island, or quickly respond after it attacks to do as much damage to the creature as they can. When the shark is found, the hunters engage in a rapid form of combat, intent on killing it or driving it to sea. If the hunters kill the shark, they win! The shark needs to outsmart the hunters and terrorize the island to accumulate enough terror to win the game by achieving the terror goal they chose at the start of play, which includes a minimum of nine terror tokens.&#10;&#10;The game takes place over several turns, made up of three phases. The shark tries to hide among debris and other sea creatures, and the hunters try to flush out the shark that can ultimately lead to an all versus one card battle. Special abilities of the shark and hunters can influence the outcome of the game.&#10;&#10;",

On a turn, a player first sees whether she can play the top card of her discard stack onto a pile in the center of the table (with numbers always being placed in ascending order) or on an opponent's discard pile (with both ascending and descending plays being valid). After this, the player draws her top card and plays it in a similar manner, if possible.

Encounters require various symbols to beat them, and those symbols are found on the twelve custom dice, which are divided up between the players as evenly as possible. Each player rolls her own dice, but once rolled the dice are pooled together to use them as best you can as a team. If you don't roll what you need, you can play Portal cards (as seen in the &quot;Sugarbellies&quot; episode of the show) or use your character's Special Abilities. Conversion Portals, Re-Roll Portals, Gift Portals and more can make the difference between success and failure.&#10;&#10;When you fail a challenge, the team suffers a calamity and the Encounter is placed into the Failed! pile. If you fail five Encounters, you lose the game! If you run out of Portal cards, you lose the game! If too many Bravest Warriors get K.O.ed, you lose the game! But if you score enough Victory Points or use up all of the Event cards, your team wins!

All the game pieces fit in a neat little printed bag. &quot;&#10;&#10;From the &quot;Handbook Of Pirate Lore&quot;:&#10;The Rules - The top has six sides. The marks generally mean:&#10;T1 - The spinner, or pirate in this case, takes one (1) Ante from the pot.&#10;T2 - The spinner takes two (2) Antes from the pot.&#10;P1 - The spinner Re-Antes one (1) into the pot&#10;P2 - The spinner Re-Antes two (2) into the pot&#10;AP - The spinner and &quot;All Players&quot; Re-Ante one (1) into the pot&#10;TA - The spinner &quot;Takes All&quot;&#10;&#10;The spinner establishes the &quot;Ante&quot; amount to start a round. There can be any number of rounds to a game. The &quot;Ante&quot; can be anything from a set amount of money, to goats. That's why soldiers and pirates loved this game! Any spinner can start a round of play. The top can be passed in any direction as long as it maintains that same direction the entire round.&#10;&#10;This game is a simple repackaging of traditional Teetotum or the later 60's version Put & Take Game&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Knights of the Rainbow is from FX Schmid USA. The box rates the game for 2-6, the rules rate it for 2-4, and the body of the rules refer to a maximum of five players. It is recommended that players stay within the 2-4 range, where 3 players seems ideal, otherwise the benefits of the honor cards (see below) are far too strong.&#10;&#10;Players start with seven strength, two gold, and no cards. On each turn a player can flip one, two, or three cards from the deck, keeping one of them and discarding the rest. All of a player&rsquo;s cards are kept face-up, stacked by type so everyone can see them.&#10;&#10;Players win by knocking out all opponents or having the highest score after three passes through the deck. Most of the cards are distributed among five color-coded types: strength, force, gold, magic, and honor. The player with the most cards of each type gains an advantage, usually at the start of his turn. The simplest of these increase a player&rsquo;s strength or gold, or decrease other players&rsquo; strength. The leader in magic can trade any of his cards for any card from the discard pile, or sacrifice any one of his own cards to destroy an opponent&rsquo;s card.&#10;&#10;Honor works differently. Shuffled into the deck are four &ldquo;King&rsquo;s Favor&rdquo; cards. When one of these is turned up, the player with the most honor gets two gold, two strength, or the top card from the deck. Misfortune cards are the dark side of the same coin, forcing loss of gold, strength, or cards from all players. Many cards bear a rainbow icon, however, and the player showing the most rainbows at the top of their stacks is protected from Misfortune.&#10;&#10;A player can spend gold at the end of his turn to buy another card from the deck, decrease an opponent&rsquo;s strength, or trade cards with an opponent. A player losing his last strength is knocked out of the game. Anyone who survives to the third appearance of the Long Live the King card (which triggers a reshuffle) scores a point for each magic card, strength, and gold they have. The highest total wins.&#10;&#10;",

You need to escape or else end up as supper, and unfortunately only one spot remains behind the controls of the hydroplane!&#10;&#10;In I Will Survive, players take on the role of one of six explorers, each with a unique combination of shield and weapon abilities. Each round consists of turns, and on each turn each player secretly chooses one of three moves &ndash; attack, defend, reload &ndash; then they all simultaneously make a gesture to signal their move. If a player defends, which costs a shield, no one can damage him this turn; if a player attacks, which costs a weapon, he injures the player targeted if that player did not defend himself; if he reloads, he reclaims spent tokens. Anyone injured moves one step closer to the cannibal's cauldron.&#10;&#10;Players continue taking turns until one or fewer explorers are uninjured. When this happens, everyone stands up, reclaims their shield and weapon tokens and starts a new round. When a player falls into the cauldron, he's out of the game.

    "description": "There are 106 cards: 5 suits (red, yellow, green, blue, purple) of 1-14, four Wild cards and 28 Action cards (Cards Up, Black Out, Pass One, Lose One). Each suit contains one special &quot;BIG&quot; card used in scoring (Red 10, Yellow 6, Green 7, Blue 12, Purple 2). Initial deal is four, Action cards in a separate stack.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you turn over an Action card and follow its instructions. You then match, build or discard one card from your hand. Cards Up turns all cards on the table face up, Black Out face down. Pass One means everyone passes a card to one's right. Lose One means you put a card down face up.&#10;&#10;Matching concerns the card values; you can collect cards of the same value as the played card, or pairs of cards that add up to that value. Building means you match as above but leave the matched cards as a pile, vulnerable to another player's matching. This is usually done so you can collect another card from your own hand (so you would &quot;Build eights&quot; with the table's 5+3 and your 8, hoping to &quot;Match eights&quot; on your next turn with your other 8). Discarding is what you do if you cannot Match or Build. This increases the table's pool of cards open for matching or building.&#10;&#10;After you've played your 4 cards in this way, another round ensues, and so forth until the entire deck has been gone through. Scoring is +10 for the most cards collected, +8 for the most Purple cards collected, +6 for the most Red cards collected, +4 for each &quot;BIG&quot; card collected, +2 for each 1 card, +2 for each Wild card.&#10;&#10;During a Black Out, you must memorize which card is which; if you declare a play but get the cards wrong, your played card is simply added to those already face down on the table.&#10;&#10;",

The Spy card can also be used to defend against another Spy.&#10;&#10;",

The winner is the first to save all her people or the most efficient to save them in the moment the island collapses.&#10;&#10;Game Development&#10;&#10;Even though the Atlantida already works as intended and the general idea is defined, it is still subject to changes. The game was developed directly for the yucata.de website, aiming to benefit from multiple plays which can provide a fair amount of players' feedback and suggestions. It is possible to play it &quot;live&quot;, though, using the print and play files and rules at the Files section.&#10;&#10;Online Play&#10;&#10;     Yucata (turn-based)&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The game is an irony of life in Poland under communist regime at the 80's.&#10;&#10;The players impersonate the TV series' characters, that attempt to adapt to the circumstances, where the omnipotent &quot;Host of the House&quot;, Mr. Aniol (the name translates to: Angel) rules. Mr Aniol is a minor dignitaire of the communist party, that has temporarily fallen out from grace, but is ready to seize any opportunity to jump back to a more fitting position at the party's ladder (one of the players takes over his role). He runs the house at his convenience, keeping the inhabitants at check, invigilating them, organizing their lives, making them (or tricking them) to do his own duties for him, using them to impress the party dignitaires with his capabilities. The inhabitants, on the other hand, try to make their own lives in the block more bearable, preferably a bit comfortable too, and to ocassionally return Mr. Aniol the favor, undermining his position.&#10;&#10;The game is full of humorous situations and negative interactions. It consists of several turns in five rounds. Turn reflects day of life. At the beginning of each round, players choose the location to which they want to go and perform the associated action given a location (or a card on hand).&#10;&#10;Each character in the game has different bonuses and ways of scoring. First person who at the end of all the rounds has the most victory points.&#10;&#10;",

Can you end up on top down below?&#10;&#10;In Dice Devils each player takes on the role of one of six devils, each ranked from 1 to 6 and each with a different special ability. On a turn, players roll their dice in secret, then one by one they each choose one of the hot items on offer on the table, starting with devil #1. When players have chosen the same item, then their dice and special abilities come into play to see who gets the goods. Fewer items are available each round than the number of players, so conflict must take place!&#10;&#10;Don't think you can rely on that ability the entire game, though, as a devil's rank in Hell is never secure and the top devil might find himself demoted to Clean Freak or Problem Child.

Each of the companies produces a slightly different product, which is made by combining two different raw materials.  The raw materials come from various parts of the center of the board.  When a company harvests these materials, they can choose to either take one, which retains the environment's purity, or they can take multiples, which can turn the area into an ecological wasteland.  Players must balance a work force which is used to collect and process the raw materials, and they must then try to get the best price for the finished product in a randomly adjusted market.  Typically in games of this nature, the corporation who makes the most money is the winner, but in this morally corrupt environment, it's the CEO who makes the most money who's deemed the winner.  And the only way to make money is by embezzling from your company...&#10;&#10;",
