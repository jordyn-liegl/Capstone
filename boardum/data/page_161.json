It&rsquo;s a place where we constantly look beyond our own physical boundaries to see what else is out there and dream of helping humanity get there one day. Each and every one of you make this place a veritable wonderland of dreams.&#10;&#10;My dream was to build such a place, but it was only an empty building before each and every one of you made it what it is today. For that, I thank you.&#10;&#10;This place has been and always will be a blessing to those who seek answers and mysteries. This is my home and I pray you feel just as welcome here.

The player is a pilot of the Italian famed Squadriglia 278, the so called &ldquo;The Same 4 Cats&rdquo; (I Soliti 4 Gatti), which flew the Italian SM79 torpedo bomber during World War 2, scoring several torpedo hits despite the technical difficulties. Through 10 mission the player must score hits, fix its plane and survive and receive the most important Italian Medal: the Gold medal to the Military Valour!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the rulebook&#10;&#10;63 colorful cards, a A3 game mat and English rules wait for you in this narrative card war game!&#10;&#10;The game components are several cards which must be divided into decks to be set up on the map; the cards are the core mechanic of the game.&#10;&#10;The player puts on the map the Damage Card (for the SM79, or for a more challenging experience, for the SM84) and the Experience Card at Value 0 or without value on the top.&#10;&#10;The decks to set up are: Campaign deck, Resolution deck, Target Ship deck and Mission deck.&#10;&#10;Campaign deck (yellow back): it is composed by the Mission cards; the player draws a card per Mission from this deck where it is shown the Mission to be accomplished by the pilot. It shows the geographical area, the number of Target Ship to draw and the type of Cards to add to the Mission deck. If the player manages to hit the Target Ship, it can receive a Reward (cards with white back), as per Reward Chart.&#10;&#10;Resolution deck (red back): it is composed by Hit and Missed cards and it is formed by a number of these cards depending on the Resolution Draw Chart. It is the engine of the game: it is used for AA draws, Torpedo draws and Damage draws.&#10;&#10;Target Ship deck (green back): it is composed by all the target ships available in the game and these are historical ships hit by the Italian SM 79; every card shows the type of ship and the number and type of Cards to add to the Mission Deck; some of them indicates a Special Decoration that the player can earn in case of successful attack to that Target Ship.&#10;&#10;Mission Deck (blue back): it is formed by a certain number and type of Event Cards plus the ones indicated on the Mission cards, on the Target Ship cards and on the Experience Chart. The player must draw a maximum of 7 Event Cards, indicating the distance from the Target Ship, a card per turn and resolve it, following the instructions indicated. Then it can decide to continue the Mission or abort it or try a Torpedo Resolution Draw, trying to torpedo the Target Ship chosen!&#10;&#10;The Campaign is composed by 10 Missions; during the Set up, the player shuffles the Mission Cards and put them face down in the Campaign Deck Area. At the start of each turn, the player draws the first Mission Card and put it in the Mission row, starting from the first (number 1).&#10;&#10;The player reads the Mission Card drawn where it is shown the Mission to be accomplished. It shows the geographical area, the number of Target Ship to draw and the type of Event Cards to add to the Mission deck. The player must choose a single Target Ship and put it on the map, in the dedicated area.&#10;&#10;The player prepares then the Mission Deck. It takes from these following Event Cards (blue back): 1 Sun Card, 1 Clouds Card, 1 Waves Card, 2 Fly Cards, 2 AA Card&#10;&#10;Then the player adds the Event Cards indicated in the current Mission Card, the Event Card(s) indicated in the Experience Chart and the Event Card(s) indicated on the Target Ship Card. All together they form the Mission Deck, which must be shuffled and put on the map, face down.&#10;&#10;The player must draw an Event Card from the Mission Deck per turn and resolve it, following the instructions indicated. Then it can decide to continue the Mission, drawing another Event Card from the Mission Deck or abort the Mission or try a Torpedo Resolution Draw, trying to torpedo the Target Ship, if within the Distance. The player can draw a maximum of 7 Event Cards, which indicate the distance from the Target Ship.&#10;&#10;The player should try to hit the Target Ship with its Torpedo.... it is not so easy!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

At the start of the game, each player receives five number cards at random along with a zero card.&#10;&#10;At the start of each round, lay out one row of number cards for each player, with two cards in each row. Each turn, all players secretly choose a card in their hand, then reveal them simultaneously. Whoever played a number card chooses all of the cards in one row and adds them to his hand, discarding the card used for bidding. Whoever played a zero card adds a card from the top of the deck to a remaining row, then reclaims the zero card. All players who played zero cards then repeat this process. If a row reaches five cards in length, add the top card from the Bull deck to this row; if all rows end in Bull cards, then players must play number cards.&#10;&#10;Whenever a player picks up a row, they must then immediately reduce their hand to five number cards (not counting their zero card, which they keep throughout), playing any excess cards in hand onto one or more stacks in front of them, with cards being played in ascending order. Bull cards are placed separately.&#10;&#10;After the last row has been picked up, the round ends. Players then create new rows and play another round. When the deck runs out, shuffle the discards to finish the round, after which the game ends. Players then score positive points for Bull cards and for the bullheads in the pile with the most bullheads; all other bullheads are negative points. The player with the highest total score wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Nobura is a forgotten planet shrouded in mystery. The story told that a cosmic being sacrificed its divine essence to breathe life into its desolate lands. Etherstones shaped the planet's biomes and interconnected all living beings with nature.&#10;Yet, the lurking threat of the Vacuous, a parasitic force born from the depths of Nobura, poses a challenge to life on the surface, weaving a tale of divine sacrifice. Nobura has always been part of a paradoxical loop of life and death, where the forces of creation and destruction dance in an eternal cosmic struggle.&#10;&#10;In Etherstone, players embody faction leaders uniting forces to avert the impending extinction, striving to gain the most victory points through various means, such as summoning cards, overcoming threats, and utilizing their abilities as effectively as possible.&#10;&#10;The first stage of the game will be drafting your hand of 7 cards and your leader card, alternatively for the first few matches, players can take a pre-made hand of cards with the matching Leader.&#10;&#10;Leaders have a set number of life points, a strength value, and a persistent asymmetric ability.&#10;&#10;The game is played in turns starting with the first player and going clockwise.&#10;&#10;There are three types of cards in the game: &#10;&#10;     Followers: That can help you during the attack when facing a threat.&#10;     Rituals: Powerful spells &#10;     Technology: Artifacts that can modify your game strategy&#10;&#10;&#10;Cards might also have abilities that activate during dice drafts based on the drafted color or number.&#10;&#10;During your turn, you can take only one action among the following:&#10;&#10;1) Dice Draft: Etherstones contain concentrated Ether, and they can be spent by players to summon cards and activate powerful effects. Five different dice representing each of the Etherstones are rolled in the center of the table.&#10;Players can draft one die from the ones available on display to immediately get 2 etherstone tokens of that color and eventually activate any summoned card effects by taking into account the drafted color and face value of the dice.&#10;&#10;2) Summon: Players summon one card from their hand by paying the relative Etherstone cost in tokens.&#10;&#10;3) Attack: With this attack action, the player overcomes one Threat card from the center of the table. They begin the attack action with an attack value of 0. They must decide if they, as the Leader,  want to personally join the attack. If so, they add the strength value of their Leader card to their attack value, but they will also be vulnerable to taking damage from the Threat. Leader cards are never exhausted, so their card is kept upright even when used.&#10;&#10;After this, they may exhaust any number of their Ready Followers to add the Follower&rsquo;s strength to their attack value. Exhausted Followers are turned to the side to show they may not be used in attack actions until rested.&#10;&#10;4) Rest: Ready all your cards and skip the turn.&#10;&#10;5) Void Pact: In case the Leader is defeated, players will skip the turn to revive their leader at full health and gain a void pact token that will be worth negative victory points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;There is no winning strategy or play style.&#10;&#10;Players will win by gaining victory points while doing several different actions and the game will end if any of the following three end-game conditions are met: &#10;&#10;     The active player has cards left in their hand. &#10;     There are no cards left in the Threat deck. &#10;     The victory point pool has no more tokens in it.&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "The official tabletop adaptation of the hit video game, Sea of Thieves: Voyage of Legends is a competitive 4X game for 2-4 players. From fulfilling bounties and following treasure maps, to raiding forts and boarding ships to steal their loot, players live the life of a nefarious pirate as they compete to earn the title of Pirate Legend before their rivals.&#10;&#10;But, players must be wary. Gaining reputation will not be easy, and they&rsquo;ll have to contend with more than just their rivals. Ancient ships prowl the oceans, and foreboding forts blot the horizon, both crewed by hostile skeletal foes. Behemoths like the kraken and megalodon, easily capable of capsizing a ship in moments, lurk in the deep just waiting for unsuspecting craft to pass overhead.&#10;&#10;Earning reputation enough to become a pirate legend can be achieved in a variety of ways, and there&rsquo;s no one way to victory. Searching out and completing contracts from one of the trading companies is a just as much a path to success as hunting enemies, and however you choose to earn your coin, spending it to upgrade your fleet with special crew and bigger ships is always a good choice.&#10;&#10;Gameplay is intuitive and easy to learn, with a fresh and streamlined approach to 4X games. Player turns follow a straightforward action economy and are designed to be quick to keep the action flowing and reduce downtime around the table. At the end of each round a fortune card system provides rubber-banding for players that are lagging behind, helping to keep the game competitive until the very last moment.&#10;&#10;The playing area, special crew, locations of treasure and enemies, and events that occur are randomised each game, meaning that every game will be different even before factoring in the actions and decisions made by the players at the table.&#10;&#10;Players will have to be engaged at all times, thanks to these cards, which can be played at any time, and because unlike other games in this genre, they won&rsquo;t have safe or fixed bases &mdash; all players ply the same seas around the outpost in the middle of the table, and must constantly be on guard for attacks.&#10;&#10;Can you win the race to become a pirate legend before your rivals? Or will you forever be a scurvy knave? Find out the answer on the Sea of Thieves!&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "There are many family games out there. On the other hand, Games for 6 players arent available that often - and at least not those with simple rules, which work fine for two and for 6 players.&#10;&#10;&quot;Stein im Brett&quot; is one of those few games. There is a big bag, which contains the playing pieces in six colours. If you play a two player game, each player will have three colours. At a game with 3 players, everyone gets two colours and with 4-6 players, each person will just have one colour on his own, whereas the remaining ones will count for nobody.&#10;&#10;With all constellations, all playing pieces will be at the bag. You will need them in order to fill up the board three times. A round will end, if there are no empty spaces on the board anymore. You only count your playing pieces and get points, if a piece wont have a neighbour of the same colour and is &quot;isolated&quot; from the others of his kind.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you grab three pieces out of the bag and place them onto empty spaces on the board. Bribing the others, telling them the -best- positions for those pieces are a vital point in this fun game, where children and parents are equal at play.&#10;&#10;&#10;Publishers Info:&#10;&#10;&quot;Familienspiele gibt es viele, Spiele f&uuml;r 6 Personen sind schon nicht mehr so h&auml;ufig anzutreffen - und Spiele mit kurzen, einfachen Regeln, die sowohl f&uuml;r zwei Personen als auch f&uuml;r 6 Personen gut sind, gibt es ganz wenige.&#10;&#10;Stein im Brett ist so ein Spiel. Im gro&szlig;en Baumwollbeutel liegen Spielsteine in 6 Farben. Spielt man nur zu zweit, besitzt jeder 3 Farben. Bei drei Spielern sind es je 2 Farben und bei 4 - 6 Spielern wird jedem nur eine einzige Farbe zugeordnet und gewertet.&#10;&#10;Es bleiben also immer alle Spielsteine mit im Spiel - das ist wichtig, denn alle Spielsteine sind notwendig, um das Spielbrett genau 3 x komplett zu belegen. Gewertet wird nach jeder Runde. Siegpunkte gibt es immer nur f&uuml;r Spielsteine ohne gleichfarbigen Nachbarstein.&#10;&#10;Da die Spielsteine blind aus dem Beutel gegriffen werden, kommt es sicher zu turbulenten Diskussionen, an welche Stelle ein bestimmter Stein gelegt wird. Es entsteht ein kurzweiliges Spiel f&uuml;r den Familien- und Freundeskreis, bei dem Kinder und Erwachsene die gleichen Chancen haben.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

Each player chooses one column, placing the story card on the table and the character cards in his hand. From the fifth round on, a player can have only four story cards in front of him, so each time he chooses a column, he must discard a story card from his collection. After the final round, players reveal their character cards and tally their points to see who wins.&#10;&#10;",

One described as the &quot;the times that tried men's souls.&quot;  One where Washington the hunted became the hunter in a miracle winter campaign across New Jersey.  One that saved the Revolution.&#10;&#10;Can you do the same playing Washington or as British General Howe can  you cross the frozen Delaware, take Philadelphia and finish off your nemesis from New York?&#10;&#10;Trenton 1776 has a campaign game that covers the entire campaign from  the chase of Washington across New Jersey, his refuge behind the Delaware river and the winter battles that reversed his fortunes.  Also included in the game are shorter scenarios; Christmas surprise: Trenton December 25/26 1776 and Bagging the Fox: Trenton and Princeton January 2/3 1777.&#10;&#10;The game has an easy rules set, playtime of 2 hours or less, and the pleasure of using wooden blocks for units.  Wooden blocks provide a &ldquo;fog of war,&rdquo; and can be rotated during battles to keep track of losses easily.  Series rules are based on New York 1776 game system so game mechanics will be familiar to owners of that game, though both games play very differently.&#10;&#10;",

You will hunt through all of history to hire the brightest minds to your cause, and each will be given command of one of your precious chronoships.&#10;&#10;However, you are not the only one with a grand vision for the future and must watch out for rivals, who will attempt to meddle with your plans!&#10;&#10;The aim of this 1-4 player worker placement game is to be the first to complete three Butterfly Effect Missions.

Each Butterfly Effect Mission will require knowledge to be collected or technology to be developed.&#10;&#10;Chronoships travel through wormholes to visit different locations in space and time, known as Time Zones (TZs).

New Alternate TZs will also spawn throughout the game, the &ldquo;Butterfly Effect&rdquo; of players meddling with the space-time continuum.&#10;&#10;Each player will start by drafting two crew-members to activate their first two Chronoships. These crew-members will be famous people from history or the future and each will have different primary and secondary abilities. It is possible to control an additional three Chronoships by recruiting new crew-members to command them.&#10;&#10;Primary abilities enhance the collection of one of five types of knowledge: Military, Exploration, Science, Politics or Culture.&#10;&#10;Secondary abilities come in 13 varieties which will help the player to compete with their rivals, ranging from Merchants to Medics, from Spies to Superstars.&#10;&#10;Utopia provides a unique experience every time, as the combination of different crew-members, technologies and missions call for the constant revision of player strategies.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Each character brings their own skills and signature equipment in order to survive against endless waves of Werewolves as Dusk turns to Night.&#10;&#10;The hordes of Werewolves are controlled by simple AI rules and to survive against them you must work together using ammo efficiently, searching supply drops for larger more brutal weapons and equipment and scavenging materials to craft your own unique items.&#10;&#10;No one game is ever the same. With unique modular boards randomly positioned, supply drops and werewolves randomly spawned and the mission objectives randomly moved, adjust your tactics in a bid to escape the ever changing situation.&#10;&#10;One of the main objectives for Full Moon Jacket was to create a strategic game with simple to learn rules and mechanics.  Over 30 blind playtests with board game and non-board game fans the mechanics have been understood within 10 minutes of playing and with many new players falling in love with the game.  The game has several play modes for Solo play, Quick play, Standard mode with crafting, Nightmare mode (for those ready to be tested!) and Survival mode (last man standing).&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Team Yankee presents the expertise that the modern tank company commander needs in easy-to-follow game rules format.  Two players each form their own strategies as they fight out potential, very real situations on the battlefield of World War III.  Soviet units have numbers and firepower; U.S. units have speed and technology.  To each side's advantages and disadvantages the players add strategy and leadership.&#10;&#10;Rules cover the essentials of movement and combat between modern combat units.  On this foundation are built special rules covering artillery, morale, chemical warfare, air support, and the other special aspects of modern warfare.&#10;&#10;The game maps cover the same ground shown in the novel.  Eight game scenarios walk you through the rules, unveiling the effects of all the rules, and showing you in detail how to play the game.  In the course of playing the scenarios, you will be able to recreate the situations in the book (and perhaps alter their course).&#10;&#10;The rules chapter on variants lets players change the scenarios to add new rules and replay scenarios to see what effects they will have on the situation.  The rules chapter on new scenarios lets players build their own forces and fight out totally new battles.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

All other rules, namely the effects of buildings, are written on the tiles.&#10;&#10;Each neighborhood tends to specialize in a few resources, but to undergo new construction you will need a little bit of everything, so there are many trade-based interactions between players.

    "description": "&quot;Goose Green&quot; is a Tactical Combat Series (TCS) board-wargame covering the first land battle of the Falklands War on May 28, 1982. The outcome of this engagement was crucial for both the Argentinians and the British: The Argentinians needed to prove themselves against the professional British war machine, while the British needed a land victory to satisfy the government and the public after recently suffering naval losses. Originally intended as a raid, the clash became a full 14-hour battle resulting in a hard-fought British victory.&#10;&#10;Goose Green covers this entire battle in turns representing 20-30 minutes each, and a map scale of 125 yards per hex. Units range from sections to platoons. Both sides fielded what was roughly a reinforced Battalion, making for a battle that made for a quick playing game with great replay value. With just a minimum of special rules, this game brings the TCS to the 1980s, where in a classic infantry confrontation, not a lot has changed since WWII.&#10;&#10;The British player must orchestrate a fast-paced attack crossing the entire map, removing all points of Argentinian resistance, and capturing Goose Green with a minimum of losses. He must make good use of few supporting arms available (half a battery of artillery, MILAN ATGMs and light mortar and MG support) to overcome dug-in Argentinian forces that outnumber the British by 2:1.&#10;&#10;The Argentinian player has solid troops with reasonable artillery and air support but must create a defense in depth against a better lead British force accustomed to a higher operational tempo and greater firepower. Every turn requires important decisions of when to hold the line, when to withdraw, and where to commit the few remaining reserves to delay and possibly stop the British attack.&#10;&#10;The Argentinians do not have the motivation and training level of the British but are dug-in with the benefit of minefields, trenches, numerous heavy weapons, and AA guns to assist the defense.&#10;&#10;Scenarios:&#10;&#10;The Battle of Goose Green (historical deployment, 39 turns)&#10;Burntside House and Low Pass (5 turns)&#10;Darwin Hill (15 turns)&#10;The Airfield and the Schoolhouse (14 turns)&#10;Bloody Goose Green (full battle with better Argentine deployment, 40 turns)&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;TCS rulebook (version 4.01)&#10;Goose Green game-specific rulebook&#10;2 x TCS Charts &amp; Tables&#10;One Full Color Game Map (22&quot;x34&quot;)&#10;140 Counters&#10;Zip Lock Bag&#10;&#10;-description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The woman that Prince Micah is about to marry is not his one and only Princess Abigail, but is really an impostor who hopes to take over the kingdom for her own evil plans! She has placed an enchantment over the real princess, who now lies fast asleep in a cottage deep in the forest.&#10;&#10;The fairy godmother has explained to you that the only way to save the kingdom from a terrible fate is to awaken the princess with a rose and get her back to the castle in time to stop the wedding.

However, saving a kingdom is hard and dangerous work, and other events have you meeting up with robbers, dragons, and other unsavory characters who are hazardous to your health. Not only must you survive these encounters, but you must find the rose, awaken the princess, and return to the castle before the sun sets (three times through the event deck) in order to succeed.&#10;&#10;A number of scenarios have also been created to vary the gameplay.&#10;&#10;",

Depending on what cards a player has, they can form a strategy for which Slimes they think they can push into first and second place at the finish line. The players bet on which Slimes they think will win. Players then take turns playing cards to move the Slimes until there is a first and second place winner. Players tally up their score and advance their score marker. First player to reach 50 points wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "The Battle of Albuera has gone down in history as the bloodiest battle of the Napoleonic Peninsular War. Marshal Soult thought he could roll up a mixed Spanish/British/Portuguese force and claim a great French victory. He was wrong. A clever flank attack was stopped dead by some of the best Spanish troops of the war. Then, despite a devastating charge by his fearsome Polish Lancers, the Allies held firm and Soult's efforts were in vain.&#10;&#10;Lines of Battle is a new series, of which Albuera 1811 is the first game. It features a fresh take on Napoleonic gaming where the essence of Napoleonic combat is distilled into an enjoyable and interactive battle experience - you can feint, outflank, form square, charge with cavalry, bombard, withdraw - it's all here.&#10;&#10;As well as the historical battle, Albuera 1811 contains optional rules for Leaders (counters included), and you can construct any number of scenarios based on a combination of &quot;what if&quot; optional rules.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "DEATH IN THE TRENCHES is a strategic-level World War I game covering the entire war, from the opening shots in Serbia and Belgium to the final defeat -- or victory! -- of Germany and Austria-Hungary in 1918. The game includes a map stretching from the Pyrenees to Moscow, and from Norway to the Sudan, covering every square inch of territory in Europe and the Near East which saw combat from 1914 to 1918, in a manageable 34x22&quot; format. An additional map shows the German colonies&#10;&#10;The game also features 400 beautifully-illustrated counters depicting the national armies that fought in the war -- from the Germans, French, British and Russians all the way down to the Persians, Montenegrins, Armenians, South Africans, and a host of other specialized units (French Foreign Legion, Gurkhas, Italian &quot;Arditi&quot;, Cossacks, Tyrolean Kaiserjaeger, Zionists, Bavarians, &quot;Dunsterforce&quot;... even the Chinese may send a small expeditionary force).&#10;&#10;DEATH IN THE TRENCHES includes a deceptively simple twelve pages of rules (and an additional twelve pages of random events) detailing the game's unique combat system (no CRT!) which portrays the grinding nature of World War I combat in a realistic way that still gives players plenty of options to pursue. Using army-level units (which contain numbers of divisional level formations, represented off-map), players use numerous special military abilities to drive back the enemy.&#10;&#10;Detailed random events rules give you more gory details about World War I than you've ever seen before in a game, while helping keep play simple and straightforward. Lenin, the Senussi revolt, intrigue in the Romanian court, the Cruise of the Emden, the Armenian Massacre, the Sinai Pipeline, the Ukrainian Reactionary Hetmanate, Rasputin, Mata Hari, the Russian shell shortage, the murder of Edith Cavell, Wilhelm Wassmuss (the &quot;German Lawrence&quot;), Lawrence of Arabia, the Nestorian resistance, Pancho Villa, the Grand Duke Nicholas, Thomas Masaryk, the Red Baron, Czech Legion, Irish Rising, Berber Revolt, air raids, typhus, influenza... they're all here.&#10;&#10;For the World War I buff, &quot;DITT&quot; has everything: Tanks, Alpenkorps, artillery barrages, flamethrowers, poison gas, Krupp guns, Mustapha Kemal, the Royal Air Force, French elan... while the great wartime leaders all leave their mark (good or bad!) on history: Bruchmuller, Haig, Hoffmann, Mackensen, Hindenburg and Ludendorff, Rennenkampf and Samsonov, Sarrail, Von Francois, Foch, Brusilov, Nivelle, Plehve, Putnik, Yudenich... they're all here. Players command the armed forces of nearly forty nations, in a game that still manages to be small enough to fit on your table!&#10;&#10;It sounds like a massive game, but it isn't. DEATH IN THE TRENCHES is designed to be played--easy to play, hard to master. You'll learn things about World War I you never knew before, and you'll have to face the same crises the leaders of the Entente and Central Powers did. Think you can do better than Douglas Haig and Robert Nivelle? Now it's your turn.&#10;&#10;Death in the Trenches won the Charles S. Roberts awards for Best DTP-Produced Boardgame (Charles S. Roberts Awards) for 2005.&#10;&#10;",

Each side represents a different posture--often considered defensive or offensive--and indicates exactly what the piece can do within the turn. At the end of a move (or use of a special ability) the tile is flipped to its other side, displaying a new offensive or defensive profile.  Each maneuver profile conveys a file's different options for movement and attack. The full circle is standard Move, a hollow circle the Jump, an arrow provides for the Slide, the star a special Strike ability and so on.  Defend your own troops while positioning yourself to capture your opponent's Duke, Jarl or Centurion tiles.&#10;&#10;With thirteen different double-sided Soldier tiles and nineteen total pieces for each player, every game of CENTURION brings different challenges requiring new strategies. Add to that players can choose to play asymmetrically with the sets from The Duke, Jarl, or CENTURION, battling among all three armies. The variety of play is limitless.&#10;&#10;",

The larger the colored area built, the more karma points the player can collect. More specifically, at the start of their turn, a player must move their monk to a new colored area on the game board. They then play as many tiles from their hand as they wish, as long as at least one of the tiles is adjacent to their monk, all of the placed tiles expand the color area, and each tile covers precisely two tiles that are on the same level. (Tiles do not need to be on the same level to be part of the same color area.)&#10;&#10;After you finish placing tiles, count the number of squares that comprise the color area to determine your area value. You may then discard meditation cards of this color from your hand that sum to this number or less. Next, you draw face-down tiles from the reserve equal to the difference between your area value and your meditation value, with your rack holding at most eight tiles. Finally, if you have more tiles on your rack than cards in hand, draw cards from your personal deck to make those numbers match.&#10;&#10;Once all the tiles have been built, the player who has scored the most karma points with their played meditation cards wins.&#10;&#10;",

The game covers the battle of Edson's Ridge, also known as Bloody Ridge, in September 1942 during the Guadalcanal campaign in 1942-43. The Japanese, as part of a complicated multi-pronged attack, sent three battalions, nearly 3000 men, charging towards the ridge protecting the airfield. Almost 800 Paramarines and Raiders defended the ridge with amazing courage and, despite suffering horrible casualties, kept from being overrun and saved both the airfield and possibly the Marine presence on Guadalcanal. The Japanese are often cited as having lost nearly 80% of their men attacking the ridge.&#10;&#10;Banzai charges, important leaders, gas attacks, even hastily assembled riggers, are represented in Kawaguchi's Gamble: Edson's Ridge.&#10;&#10;Kawaguchi's Gamble: Edson's Ridge is five turns long, each turn is a variable length of alternating impulses.

The fierce battle, that took place between December 12-23, 1942, was not a foregone conclusion. The fate of 20 German divisions hung in the balance&mdash;and the loss of 6th Army would turn the tide in the Eastern Front.&#10;&#10;The German player must use his initial advantage to open a corridor to 6th Army. The Soviet player will react quickly, but must first withstand a powerful enemy attack before he can bring powerful reinforcements to bear.&#10;&#10;The game scale is two miles per hex. Each turn represents 12 hours. Units vary in size from Companies to Army (headquarters only). Designer Mark Stille performed intensive research during the design. The German OOB is drawn from the actual War Diary of the 4th Panzerarmee and from the incomparable &quot;Stalingrad&quot; by Manfred Kehrig, a detailed German-language book on the subject.

Each horse has a handicap rating and the higher the better basically. Each horse's stamina is adjusted once the going has been determined by spinning the going adjuster.&#10;&#10;The going is important as it dictates the amount of speed points each horse gets. For example, if the going is firm all get 64; if heavy 54. The horses handicap mark is added to however many spaces a player chooses to move their horse per go of a player. So, again, the higher the handicap, the more likely you are to win.&#10;&#10;There are times when you will land on a fence and so an appropriate card is drawn and it must be acted upon immediately. There are also horseshoe spaces that can bring good and bad luck.&#10;&#10;More than just a dice throw and race game, each player must ensure that each of their horses has enough speed points to go two circuits around the lovely board. There are 24 hand painted horses and it all just looks nice.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "In Piraten-Abenteuer &ndash; previously published as Corsaro &ndash; players have been forced to take refuge near Adventure Island, and now they must work together to move all their boats to safety while trying to avoid the pirates who patrol the nearby waters. If a boat is captured by the pirates, the players have a chance to rescue the prisoners... at the cost of valuable time and supplies.&#10;&#10;This cooperative game is played on a board which shows the route from Adventure Island back to the player's home town. Each player starts with a boat on Adventure Island, and two pirate ships are placed along the route. The game is played in turns. Each turn, a player rolls two dice, then choses one die to use for his own boat and one die to use for one of the pirate ships. Both are moved as many places forward as the selected die shows. At certain points, the player can have his ship take a hidden route, which is not used by the pirate ships.&#10;&#10;If a pirate ship passes a boat, or if a boat passes a pirate ship, the boat is captured and placed on Pirates' Island. Other boats can free it if they manage to land on one of the rescue spaces on the track; the rescued boat is then returned to that same space.&#10;&#10;When all boats have reached the home town, the players have won the game. However, if some ships are captured while all other ships have reached the home town, the players lose.&#10;&#10;The difficulty level can be increased by giving each player two or three boats instead of one. The greatest challenge is the Grand Adventure, in which each player has three boats, there is a third pirate ship, and each player may hide on the hidden routes at most five turns during the game.&#10;&#10;The 2011 AMIGO edition is part of its &quot;&Ouml;kologisch + Kooperativ&quot; (Ecological &amp; Cooperative) line of games.&#10;&#10;",

The best combination is a three-of-a-kind, with three 6s beating three 5s, which beats three 4s, and so on. The next best combination is a straight, followed by a pair, followed by a single die, with higher numbers beating low ones in each of these combinations, e.g, a combination of 5-5-2 beats 4-4-6. For each row won, the player receives 1 point.&#10;&#10;The first player to reach 5 points wins the game!&#10;&#10;",
