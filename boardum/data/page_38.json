    "description": "In Game of Trains, each player is in charge of their line of trains. At the beginning of the game, the train cars in the player's train line &mdash; each with their own number &mdash; are sorted in descending order. The aim of the game is to be the first one to rearrange your train line so that the cards are in ascending order. Each card has a train car with a number and also a special power depicted on it.&#10;&#10;On a turn, the player can do one of two things: draw a card from the draw pile and replace one of the cards in their train line with the newly drawn card, or take a face-up card from the middle of the table and use it as a special power. Cards that are replaced from a player's train line are put in the middle to be used as special powers, and the cards that are used as special powers are discarded. Special powers include such actions as swapping two cards, moving a card, destroying everyone's cards, and so on. The players keep taking turns until one has their train line in ascending order and wins.&#10;&#10;",

In each turn, they take an action by deploying one of their workers or their truck to brew an increasing variety of beers, improving the brewing process with new advancements like refrigeration machines or beer filters, or increasing the efficiency of their workers, to name but a few. Action cards also play an important role, and with beer deliveries and other actions, they can earn victory points. Actions take place on the game board and their own player tableau, the player order is important and influenced by the players, bonus workers enable additional actions but must first be earned by placing the right worker on the right action space.&#10;&#10;Beer Pioneers extends over an indefinite number of rounds. Once a player reaches 20 victory points, this is the final round, and the brewmaster with the most victory points is the winner of the game.&#10;&#10;-description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

At the bidding of the magistracy, scout vehicles are lowered to the barren surface to search for suitable mining areas.&#10;&#10;The goal of Magnastorm is to be the first player with a certain number of reputation points. You acquire reputation mostly through fulfilling objectives, taking control of one or more of the eight commanders, and building transmitter stations. The flow of the game is controlled by an action board with two action panels, each of which has five columns. At the start of each round, there are a 3-5 action tokens (crew members) standing in each column on the upper action panel. To carry out an action, a player:&#10;&#10;A) takes an action token from the upper panel and places it on the lower action panel either to gain resources or to pay for a movement on the planet surface, or&#10; B) pays for every action token still standing in a certain column on the upper panel to gain control over the commander and his ability at the top of that panel, after which the player places those action tokens on the lower panel.&#10;&#10;Since option A) will reduce the cost for option B), the players have to find the right timing for their actions. A round ends when the upper panel is empty. For the next round, the panels are swapped.&#10;&#10;Magnastorm is a big, tactical board game with very little luck. Choose the right moment to perform actions or buy influence over helpful commanders. You will reap success through resource management, clever logistics, good timing, and a shrewd eye on the actions of your opponents. At the end of the game, each player receives one of 120 reward cards, which can be used in later games to compensate for varying levels of skill among the players.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Darjeeling has two main board areas.  The first is an array of squares representing one, two or three half-crates of tea in four different varieties (colors).  Each player has a marker which moves about in the array, picking up tea at the rate of one square per turn.  There are simple rules governing movement in this array and the players compete for the desirable squares.&#10;&#10;Eventually, several times per game, each player has enough squares of a single color to fit them together so that the half-crates all make whole crates.  Now he can make a tea shipment.  This pays off in victory points in three different ways.  First, there is a &quot;demand&quot; award of up to 6 VP depending on how long it has been since anyone shipped this variety.  Second, if the shipment was of at least four crates, there is a flat bonus of 1 VP per crate.&#10;&#10;Third and most pivotally, there are VP that will be awarded at the beginning of the player's next and subsequent turns.  Each tea shipment is represented with cubes of the player's color (not the tea variety color) on a sort of barge.  The new shipment of tea is always placed, in the other of the two main board areas, at the top of a column of all the recent shipments (the number of total shipments varying with the number of players in the game), so that as more shipments are made, the old shipments drift farther down the column and eventually out of play.  At the beginning of your turn, you look to see where your shipments are in this column, and they pay out VP with better multipliers the higher they still are in the column.  This constitutes the driving force of the game, as nobody else wants to see your shipment at the top of the column for several turns in a row.  Players thus have an incentive to make a shipment even if they haven't yet assembled a large number of crates.&#10;&#10;It's a race to 100 points.  A runaway leader can easily take over if the rest of the table is not vigilant, so the best games of Darjeeling are those among vigilant players.&#10;&#10;",

With 40 new modules and 174 cards in the campaign deck, you can reset everything and play multiple campaigns &mdash; with a different story and gameplay experience emerging each time.&#10;&#10;In the standard game, each player has double-sided clue cards in front of them.

As you discover more and more of the solution, a story starts to emerge: your Neighbor stole something from the ice cream shop, but what? And why?

As protection from your rival, you have only your magical gifts, your mastery of the Grimoire, and a select few spell pages ripped from its binding.

Defeat your opponent by drafting new spells from the magical Grimoire, casting them, managing your cooldowns, and dealing massive damage.&#10;&#10;Each turn, draft one new spell to be added to your spell repertoire. But be warned! Your opponent has access to the same spells as you do, so choose the spells you want before your opponent does! Continue updating your spell repertoire throughout the game to optimize your deck and counter your opponent.&#10;&#10;Cast spells. Deal devastating damage or confuse and trip up your opponent. More expensive spells will have a larger impact on the game, but be careful, they&rsquo;ll cost you more mana and will have a longer cool down. You can cast as many spells as you like on your turn so long as you have enough mana and the spells aren&rsquo;t in cooldown. Find spell combinations that work together and time them correctly, to increase your damage or counter your opponent.&#10;&#10;Be the first wizard apprentice to eliminate your opponent's life points to become Keeper of the Grimoire.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "This game illustrates Herr Rosenberg&#039;s talent for unique card games.  The deck is one through nine in six suits, with two of each card (two 1s, two 2s, etc.).  After the initial hand of eight is dealt, players select one card value to collect, which is placed face-up in front of each player.  A fairly standard trick-taking game takes place with the remaining cards, with players following suit if they can.  If you cannot, the card you play can be trump, if you desire.  If two cards of the same suit/value appear, the second can be declared as either high or low.  When a player wins a trick, the cards of the same value they are collecting are placed in his 'good' pile, with each worth one point.  All the rest are put in the 'bad' pile, with each worth minus one point.  However at the end of each hand, you can convert one value of cards from your 'bad' pile onto the 'good' pile.  Of course, if you had enough of them, you'll be collecting that value for the next hand...&#10;&#10;",

Also, the brand new two-player mode really opens up new gaming opportunities, all making the game more accessible for even the most casual gamer.&#10;&#10;In Dune, you will take control of one of the four great factions&mdash;House Atreides, House Harkonnen, the Fremen, and the Imperium&mdash;all vying to control the most valuable resource in the universe: melange, the mysterious spice only found at great cost on the planet Dune. Ship your forces to Dune, harvest spice, seize control of strongholds, and destroy your enemies. Who will control Dune? You decide!&#10;&#10;The game is played multiple phases, some of which don't have player specific actions, like in the Spice phase, a Spice Blow card is drawn and spice is added to the board in two territories, or else a Sandworm attacks that last two territories where spice was placed. But on the card phase, each player draws up to a hand of 4 Battle cards, and then may purchase Market cards up to a hand of 3 for 2 spice each. On the Shipping and Movement Phase, players take turns adding forces to the board and then moving forces on the board. Each player's faction has&#10;&#10;The game plays 3 to 5 Rounds. Starting on Round 3, the game can end if a player occupies 3 strongholds at the end of the Round. If no one occupies 3 strongholds at the end of Round 5, then the player with the most spice wins (and each stronghold they occupy counts as 5 spice).&#10;&#10;",

Players start with particular stock holdings based on the number of players in the game and their position in turn order.&#10;&#10;Each turn, one stock card is revealed from the deck. Players earn $1 for each share of this color that they own, then an auction ensues. Turn by turn, players must drop one of their bidding chips into a bowl in order to stay in the auction.

    "description": "The ground trembles under a thousand angry hoofbeats. Wheels creak and reins pull as racers drive their horses forward in a panic.&#10;&#10;You are a charioteer in the Circus Maximus, the greatest raceway in the ancient world.&#10;&#10;A crescendo of noise builds with each lap. Chariots collide, whips crack. The crowd cheers for a surprising breakaway, rumbles as a favorite is damaged and falls behind. From the imperial box, the emperor laughs and shouts. Clouds of dust obscure the bright banners of the four factions.&#10; Three hundred thousand fans are on their feet as you turn the final corner. This is not the finish they expected. You lead by a length, and only one rival remains; each throws the last of their energy into one final sprint. Many thousands are despondent, other thousands exultant and joyous. Their shouts become a roar, a long scream, as you surge for the finish line. Another hundred yards will make you a hero.&#10;&#10;&#10;Charioteer is a new game from Sekigahara: The Unification of Japan author Matt Calkins. Like Matt's previous games, Charioteer features simple rules, quick play, and novel mechanisms.&#10;&#10;Charioteer is a strategic racing game that plays in one hour. Each player controls a chariot in the Circus Maximus of ancient Rome. There's lots of action, and it happens quickly, with simultaneous move selection.&#10;&#10;Movement is determined by melding sets from a hand of cards. Every card does more than one thing, and it takes multiple matching cards to make a move. Choosing to use a card in one set means deciding not to use it in another. Timing when to make a critical move is as important as knowing what move to make.&#10;&#10;Moves come in four colors, and each has a special advantage. Play a red move to attack your opponents, yellow to recover from disruption, black to turn a sharp corner, and green to sprint.&#10;&#10;Each racer begins the game with different abilities, and they improve their skills as the race progresses, leading to big bonuses in their favorite types of moves. Show the emperor the kind of move he prefers, and a racer's skills will increase even faster.&#10;&#10;Players deploy tokens to give their moves a special bonus. More tokens can be earned by impressing the crowd with large matching card plays. Players may choose to delay using their best sets until they're big enough to qualify for a fan token.&#10;&#10;Some races will be violent and others calm, depending upon whether the players and emperor behave disruptively. Attacks cause damage, which reduces movement speed. Players who specialize in recovery moves may overcome damage quickly. Others may need to carefully deploy their shields on turns when violence is expected.&#10;&#10;It's not always clear who's winning the race. Being in front of the pack may not be as important as developing a critical skill, collecting powerful tokens, or keeping damage low. Whip icons allow those who have fallen behind to surge back into competition.&#10;&#10;Charioteer is easy to learn. It can be played by bright kids as well as adults. Despite its accessibility, it is a game of skill.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "String Railway is a unique train game that consists of colored strings, tokens, station tiles, and a board for scoring. To set up, first place the string tied in a big circle on the table to establish the field area for the game. Next, place a small circle of string to represent mountains and a line of string to represent a river. Finally, place the main stations for each player equal distances apart from one another.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you draw and place a station tile, then try to place a railroad string between your stations in an effort to connect them in order to form your own train network. Connected stations earn victory points (VPs).&#10;&#10;After five turns, the game ends and the player with the most VPs wins.&#10;&#10;",

Many companies have a destination station and receive a large part of their working capital only if they have connected this station to their route network. The game also features mountain railways, tunnels, private companies and two different types of locomotives, providing for lots of variation for railway enthusiasts and lovers of complex games.&#10;&#10;A special feature of 1854, set in Austria, is located in the stock split, which comes into play in the additional shares. As in 1844, there are mergers of companies, two types of locomotives, tunnels, mountain railways, and private companies. In addition, some private companies operate on a separate game board depicting the Steyr region.&#10;&#10;",

In round 3, the cluegiver can use no words at all and can pass as often as he likes; again, teammates are allowed only a single guess. Give good physical clues in round 1, and they'll pay dividends down the road when you need to keep your mouth shut and gesture like a maniac before time's up!&#10;&#10;",

Each turn the current players 'kicks down the door' - drawing an encounter card from the deck. Usually this will involve battling a monster. Monsters have their own levels and players must try and overcome it using the levels, weapons and powers they have acquired during the game or run away. Other players can chose to help the player or hinder by adding extra monsters to the encounter. Defeating a monster will usually result in drawing treasure cards and acquiring levels.

    "description": "A Game of the War in the East: 1941-44.&#10;&#10;Russian Front is a wargame that re-creates the ebb and flow of the largest, longest and most costly military campaign of World War II. The game covers the vast theater of operations and the massive forces employed by the Soviet Union and by Nazi Germany and her allies. Only this time, YOU are in command.&#10;&#10;&#10;    Alternate scenarios: Games can be played that start in May or June of 1941, in 1942, or in 1943.&#10;    Unique Combat system: Combat occurs within a hex, units take incremental losses, and battles can require more than one round of resolution.&#10;    Land, Air, and sea: Units are included for and battles occur in all combat environments.&#10;    Blitz Attacks: Armor units may breakthrough fronts to drive deep into enemy territory.&#10;    Variable Endings: End any game at the conclusion of a six month period or continue on to the end of the campaign.&#10;&#10;&#10;The Basic rules allow players to quickly start playing the game and mastering the system. The Advanced and Optional rules allow players to choose the levels of complexity and detail that they enjoy.&#10;&#10;TIME SCALE: One month per turn. &#10;MAP SCALE: Twenty-five miles per hex. &#10;UNIT SCALE: Corps, armies, fleets, and flotillas. &#10;PLAYERS: Two. &#10;PLAYING TIME: From two to eighteen hours, depending on the scenario and rules used.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the back of the box&#10;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;ScenariosIncluded in the game are three scenarios: 1941, 1942, and 1943.  The Barbarossa scenario also has an early start option with some historically plausible options for allowing this.  The '42 scenario, while historical, is quite imbalanced in favor of the Axis player.  Is a great way to practice the Summer '42 turns though so it is certainly recommended.  Finally is the '43 scenario.  This is imbalanced in favor of the Soviet player and is essentially Barbarossa in reverse.  It is very, very important that players practice this one.  It is the best way to learn the strengths of the Soviet side.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Consolidated RulebookThe Avalon Hill Game Company (TAHGC) quickly released a few important errata for the printed game.  This was released in GENERAL 22-4.  Then, two years later, extensive errata was released in GENERAL 24-1.  Both of these are available for download in the 'files' section below.  However, a new digital rulebook is available for download with all errata already incorporated.  This is also available in the 'files' section.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;The Wargame Academy Tournament RulesVarious rules are subject to interpretation.  The stated goal of the Wargame Academy is to provide a tournament rulebook where interpretive rules are explicitly stated with only one ruling.  This will enable tournament play.

To that end custom map extensions have been designed by more than one player.  The VASSAL module now has map extensions available as an option for play.  West to Berlin, Northeast to Archangel, and Southeast to Baku are all included.

But beware: as the city grows, everything you build will also open up new opportunities for your competitors. Will you make a fortune? Or will you be caught out when the boom inevitably turns to bust in a game-ending market crash?&rdquo;&#10;&#10;---&#10;&#10;Magnate: The First City is a midweight strategy game for 1-5 players. Each turn players try to grow their property empire by performing different actions, including: buying plots of land, constructing buildings, marketing their developments and selling them completely for their capital value. Once per round, they will also get the chance to attract tenants to any empty buildings they have. If they are successful, they will start collecting rent from their tenants and increase the value of their holdings. At the same time, they will also create new development opportunities for themselves and their opponents.&#10;&#10;But in Magnate, as in real life, not all locations are equally appealing to all types of tenant. Magnate&rsquo;s four types of tenant - residential, offices, retail and industry - all want to be linked to other types of tenant in nearby neighbourhoods. And they are all affected differently by what&rsquo;s next door: The airport is an asset for offices, but it&rsquo;s an unattractive place for new residents. By clever tactical and strategic building, players can increase their odds of attracting these tenants and improve their return on investment - without benefiting their opponents too much.&#10;&#10;But while the players acquire more and larger properties, the price of land keeps rising higher and higher. Eventually, it becomes completely unsustainable and a game-ending crash that will destroy the value of players&rsquo; properties becomes inevitable. When exactly the crash happens, however, is shaped by the players: How much land they buy and how much property they sell will more make a crash on any specific turn more or less likely. Players must time their actions carefully to avoid substantial losses while maximizing their profits. Only then will they emerge victorious as the city&rsquo;s wealthiest property magnate.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Starting with the starting player for the current turn, the players pick dice (and take actions) clockwise one at a time. This is done until all the dice are distributed or nobody can pick another die; you can only ever pick a die that has a higher face value than the previous die you picked.&#10;&#10;When picking a die, players can choose between four actions:&#10;&#10;     Take one special card (regardless of the die value); the special cards give players extra actions, bonuses and more; on the other hand, players can pick up a card that collapses the mine - in this case all the players lose their saved diamonds&#10;     Take money (amount is determined by the die value)&#10;     Take diamonds (values 0&ndash;5, amount determined by the die value) from the bag; if you pick the white stone, you lose all diamonds you picked up this round&#10;     Explore and set up a tent (row determined by the dice value); this costs players money&#10;&#10;&#10;Additionally, the players can do the following actions at any time of their turn for free:&#10;&#10;     Sell diamonds for money&#10;     Contribute coins to the Queen; you have to inform other players you are doing this, but you do not have to specify the value - coins are stored in a chest in secret&#10;&#10;&#10;At the end of the turn, the boat is advanced (one column) further in the Zambezi river. The game ends when the boat cannot advance (eg. it has reached the last row).&#10;&#10;The players score points in two different ways:&#10;&#10;     At the end of each turn, the current column is scored; each tent in a row scores the row amount (die/row value = amount of points)&#10;     At the end of the game, each row is scored; the player with the majority of tents in each row scores points (lower die/row numbers score more points)&#10;&#10;&#10;The player who has contributed the least amount of money to the Queen cannot win the game, even if they collected the most points.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Star Trek: Expeditions is a board game for up to four players, set in the &quot;New Universe&quot; of Star Trek, as seen in the 2009 movie. It is built upon the cooperative board game model and the players will work together against the game itself.&#10;&#10;In the game, players assume the roles of Kirk, Spock, Bones and Uhura. The premise is the Federation has received a petition for membership from a planet and the Enterprise is dispatched to assess their application. When the Enterprise arrives, they discover:&#10;&#10;&#10;     A Klingon battle cruiser is in orbit;&#10;     Civil war is threatening to break out on the planet;&#10;     And the planet is (coincidentally?) reconsidering its application for UFP membership.&#10;&#10;&#10;Your mission is threefold; defuse the threat of civil war, deal with the Klingon threat and get the planet to join the UFP. And you only have 30 days (roughly equaling 30 turns) in which to do it, or a Klingon battle fleet will warp in and you will be forced to withdraw (thus failing your mission).&#10;&#10;Each objective is tracked on a scoresheet that monitors your progress. Decisions you make in the game as well as how you interact with the other players will affect the outcome of the mission.&#10;&#10;The four figures are fully rendered, 3D versions of the four Bridge officers. The four figures and two spaceships are similar to Heroclix figures, with the clicks on the dials at the base of the figure representing damage and corresponding diminished abilities.&#10;&#10;This product is designed as a non-collectible, non-blind, all-in-one-and-done game, but is built upon the &quot;expandable&quot; board game model meaning that down the line, new missions and crew members will be made available for folk to play other &quot;episodes&quot;!&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "In the Cyclades archipelago, off the shores of a divided Greece, players develop their cities and compete for supremacy under the watchful gaze of the gods.&#10;&#10;In Cyclades: Legendary Edition, designers Bruno Cathala and Ludovic Maublanc have reworked the Cyclades base game and its many expansions to make gameplay more dynamic and fluid.&#10;&#10;The game features a strategic bidding system that defines the actions available to each player on their turn. You must balance your finances to optimize the various actions provided by the different gods, with each player gaining the support of only one god each turn. The game features a shorter and more dynamic bidding phase than the original Cyclades thanks to a new exponential bidding scale. Six gods are available instead of the five, increasing the variety of actions available:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Ares allows the movement of player armies and the building of fortresses.&#10;     Poseidon allows players to move their navies and build ports.&#10;     Zeus allows his followers to hire priests and build temples.&#10;     Athena provides her worshipers with philosophers and universities.&#10;     Apollo increases the income of his worshipers.&#10;     Hera provides mercenaries to enforce your troops during battle.&#10;&#10;&#10;Players now use landscape tiles to assemble the modular game board during set-up, allowing for ever-changing maps and game strategies. New creatures and heroes are available in the base game, offering new strategic opportunities to build metropolises and gain decisive advantages on the battlefield. Your goal is to be the first to control three metropolises, which can be obtained as follows:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Economic development, by constructing four different buildings.&#10;     Intellectual development, by owning four philosophers.&#10;     Heroic deeds, when sacrificing a hero.&#10;     Military conquest, when seizing an enemy city by strength.&#10;&#10;&#10;Cyclades: Legendary Edition features three game configurations:&#10;&#10;&#10;     &quot;Classic&quot; mode for 3-5 players in which each player defends their own interests.&#10;     &quot;Team&quot; mode for 4 or 6 players in which you play in teams of two, co-operating with one another and competing against others.&#10;     An enhanced and refined two-player mode.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "In Mino Dice, first released as Skull King: Das W&uuml;rfelspiel, players try to predict the result of dice battles, and whoever predicts most accurately will come out the winner of the contest.&#10;&#10;The game includes seven types of dice: minotaurs, griffins, mermaids, and four types of number dice. The game lasts 6-8 hands depending on the number of players, and in each round each player draws a number of dice from the bag equal to the current hand, e.g., five dice for the fifth hand, then places them behind their screen, keeping these dice a secret from all. After getting their dice, each player simultaneously bids the number of tricks they think they'll claim during the round by putting out fingers on their hand. Record these bids on the scoresheet.&#10;&#10;The first player in a hand chooses a die from behind their screen, then rolls it in public. If they roll a number die, each other player must roll a number die of this color, if possible; otherwise they roll a die of their choice. Alternatively, a player can always roll a minotaur, griffin, or mermaid die. After each player has rolled, see who has the highest die and claims this trick. A rolled flag is a 0 and cannot win the trick. The minotaur beats the griffin, which beats the mermaid, which beats the minotaur &mdash; and all of these special characters beat numbers. If no one rolls a special character, the highest number rolled wins the trick, with a tie being broken in favor of whoever rolled later. The player who wins the trick collects the dice in front of their screen, then chooses a die from their collection to start the next trick.&#10;&#10;After all the tricks have been claimed, players score points. If you made your bid exactly, score 20 points per trick bid; if you missed your bid, lose 10 points for each trick your bid was off, whether higher or lower. If you bid zero tricks and make it, score 10 points for each trick in the hand; if you miss a 0 bid, lose 10 points for each trick in the hand regardless of how many tricks you made. If you made your bid and captured a minotaur with a mermaid without also capturing a flag, score 50 bonus points; similarly, if you capture a griffin with a minotaur without capturing a flag, score 30 bonus points.&#10;&#10;Whoever has the highest total score after the last hand is complete wins.&#10;&#10;",

Much has been said (and even more has been written) about the previous administration&rsquo;s haphazard management of Healthy Heart. In an effort to save the Hospital, you and your allies among its leading Physicians have staged a recent &ldquo;Clinical Coup&rdquo; and taken over the Hospital to restore its prestige. However, actually managing things from the inside is never as easy as it appears from the outside, and juggling the responsibilities at Healthy Heart Hospital can quickly turn even the noblest healer into a money-grubbing pragmatist cynically looking for a place to hide the victims of your &ldquo;care.&rdquo;&#10; Does your team have what it takes to bring Healthy Heart Hospital back to its former glory without becoming Hard Hearted in the process?&#10; Healthy Heart Hospital is a cooperative game for 1 to 5 players, played in rounds, with each player spending actions to treat and (hopefully) cure the various patients that come pouring into the hospital each round. Patients are represented by a number of cubes of various colors. Color represents the type of illness, while the number of cubes represents the severity of the illness.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Rolling America, based on the 2014 release Rolling Japan, is a light &quot;multiplayer solitaire&quot; dice game. Each player has a map of the United States that's divided into fifty (abstractly represented) states, which are then bunched together into six differently colored areas.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player draws two regular six-sided dice from a bag and rolls them; the bag starts with seven dice, six matching the colors of the areas on the map along with a wild clear die. All players now write down each number rolled on any state of the matching color, i.e., if the blue die shows 4 and the yellow a 2, write a 4 in one blue state and a 2 in one yellow state. If the clear die is rolled, you can place this number in a state of your choice; additionally, three times per game you can choose to use a non-clear die as any color. However, neighboring states can't have numbers with a difference larger than 1; if you can't place a number without breaking this rule, then you must place an X in a state of the appropriate color. (If all the states in an area are filled, you can ignore the die or use one of your three color changes to place the number elsewhere.)&#10;&#10;Rolling America has a few changes from Rolling Japan. The &quot;guard&quot; action allows you to ignore the neighboring number restriction three times during the game, and the &quot;dupe&quot; action allows you to use one of the active dice twice in the same region. As in real life, Alaska and Hawaii are not connected to the continental United States, so you can drop any numbers you want in those states!&#10;&#10;After six dice have been rolled, mark one round as being complete, then return the dice to the bag and start the next round. After eight rounds the game ends, and whoever has the fewest Xs on their map wins.&#10;&#10;",

Some players complained of ambiguities in these rules and the Campaign Game became known as difficult to play, and unbalanced for 2 players to play.  Some commented that the Campaign Game felt &quot;tacked on&quot; to an otherwise excellent collection of scenarios.  General Vol. 23 Issue 4 provided official rules to help with the 2 player Campaign Game.  However, regarding the Naval Rules, an official correction (2nd Edition Rules of '81) would further complicate matters until the game designer released his own update in General Vol. 19. Issue 5.  The Campaign Game was further altered for &quot;more realism&quot; by an article in General Vol. 31 Issue 2.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;3rd Edition GameThis Unofficial 3rd Edition of the Rules compiles and reconciles all of the differences in the rules, as published by Avalon Hill over the years.  Comprised from the 1st Edition Rulebook, Errata, 2nd Edition Rulebook, 3rd Edition Naval Rules (Official), Q&amp;A, and Misc. released by Avalon Hill through the years, the 3rd Edition Rulebook is the definitive edition.  Also included are all official variants and optional rules.  Available now for download in the 'Files' section of this page.  This effort embraced the official work almost exclusively.  The 4th Edition will attempt to fix some of the issues in the official work.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;4th Edition Game Available NowThe Unofficial Mapboard, in support of the comprehensive rulebook and titled the 4th Edition Mapboard, is now available. 1st Edition Mapboard was the initial release.  Some suggestions for updates were made so that is considered the 2nd Edition (for those who used whiteout on the 4th river of Kiev).  The brand new map was the 3rd Edition.  The 4.0 version, where unofficial work is involved, is available now on the VASSAL web site as part of the module and as a PDF for printing.&#10;&#10;The 4th Edition Rulebook is specific to the 4th Edition Mapboard and has significant unofficial work to fix various issues.

It is not for a specific product or release. Versions will appear on the individual item pages.&#10;&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;Battleground: Fantasy Warfare is a point-based table-top tactical wargame in which units are represented by cards instead of a collection of figures or models. We bring you all the charging, flanking and intricate maneuvering of a great wargame in a convenient package for a fraction of the cost.&#10;&#10;As the general of a fantasy army of Men, Orcs, Elves or whatever faction you choose, you will muster your forces and command them in battle.  You will have an agreed-upon number of points to spend on your army, which will determine the size of the battle.  You and your opponent will then take turns deploying your forces on the battlefield.  Finally you will give them their orders and the battle begins.&#10;&#10;During play you will have a limited number of Command Actions each turn &ndash; one for every 500 points available for building your army.  These Command Actions represent what you can do as a general.  You can spend them to change a unit&rsquo;s orders or take direct control of a unit for a turn, rally routed units, draw cards that can provide small combat bonuses or to use your special army ability.&#10;&#10;Unlike most tabletop wargames where you have complete control over every soldier&rsquo;s actions, Battleground puts you in the role of a true general.  Your troops are loyal and will obey your orders but you can&rsquo;t be everywhere so you have to spend your resources carefully!&#10;&#10;",

Each book has been placed precisely in the pit, positioned according to exacting rituals; their function to prevent chaos from emerging from the pit. The Keeper is entrusted to stop the souls of the damned from escaping - something they attempt continuously - by touring the labyrinth and keeping the power contained in the books strong enough to seal the abyss. Only the Keeper knows the rituals and the exact position of every volume as he&rsquo;s the sole person with access to the Sator secrets.&#10;&#10;SATOR AREPO TENET OPERA ROTAS is the seal that keeps the souls of the damned from flowing away...&#10;&#10;But the power of the old Keeper is waning, and the sinners&rsquo; pit has felt this, using the breath of the damned to slowly shift the volumes which compose the Sator across the labyrinth in order to open a passage for their souls into our world.&#10;&#10;Thus, the four Acolytes of the Keeper have been entrusted to recover the holy books that have been moved across the labyrinth. Each volume contains a key which lets one understand some of the arcane words of the Sator and thereby regain control of the labyrinth. The Acolyte who first recovers the four holy books that the Keeper has asked him to find will be able to access the Sator and become the new Keeper.&#10;&#10;Goal&#10;&#10;Each player represents an Acolyte and tries to be the first to recover the four books that the Keeper has entrusted to him (the four books in the color of his pawn). &#10;The sinners&rsquo; pit is an intricate labyrinth of Footbridges and mobile walkways that can be moved by gears and pulleys. They can be turned and pushed in order to create a safe path over which the Acolyte may safely walk the abyss.&#10;&#10;To move Footbridges, each Acolyte may read from the book Incertus Movet in Aere Sospeso', which is a kind of user&rsquo;s manual explaining how to manipulate the walking passages to meet his needs. The more Footbridges the Acolyte moves during his turn, the farther he will be able to walk.&#10;What&rsquo;s more, he will be able to use the content of his own Liber Fidei, a set of prayers, thoughts and ascetic books, to perform apparently impossible actions (such as the manipulation of time and space) thanks to the power of his faith...&#10;&#10;",

You win by building up your hero, scouting gang dens to find the baddies who wronged you, then taking bloody revenge through action-packed fight sequences made up of dice based puzzles.&#10;&#10;Vengeance alternates between montage turns and fight turns.  In montage turns, players heal and upgrade their heroes through new abilities and items. They also go out scouting gang dens to find the bosses who wronged them and take revenge on them in the fight turn.&#10;&#10;The fight turn is the heart of the game. Players pick one of the scouted gang dens containing a boss who has wronged them and burst into the gang den to exact bloody revenge. Players gain VPs for killing the boss, clearing the den from all the minions or, for maximum points, both. Players have three turns to do this and get out of the den in one piece.&#10;&#10;Fights are basically dice-based puzzles. In each round of the fight, players roll a set of dice and decide the order in which they play the rolled results. Upgrade skills and items allow players to swap die-results for others or string together a number of results to perform enemy-slapping combos. Upgrades thus work towards mitigating the luck of the die-roll, giving players more control over their Fight actions.&#10;&#10;Players score points by killing bosses who wronged them, i.e., matching the figure on their vengeance card with one of the face down Boss cards attached to each den and/or by clearing all minions of a gang which matches the color of a vengeance card they have in play.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game players also score bonus victory points through three mission cards in play.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Band of Brothers: Ghost Panzer is a fast playing game of squad level combat in WWII. It covers the exploits of the German 11th Panzer Division in Russia from 1941 to 1944. The rules are very simple (no combat charts are needed) with very few exceptions to remember and yet the game is meant to be all encompassing and will include infantry, tanks, and artillery.&#10;&#10;Based on years of research, the game system uses a unique suppression mechanic. There are no longer two unique states for a unit, but varying degrees of suppression. This allows suppression to accumulate from multiple fire sources and means that the unit will not take a morale check until it is asked to do something. You will never know for sure how your units will respond until they are needed.&#10;&#10;Although casualties can be caused by artillery and heavy weapons (which makes them prime battlefield targets), squads will never cause significant casualties shooting at range at dug in, first line troops. Their goal is to fire and maneuver. Sections of the enemy force must be pinned down and eliminated from up close. The system itself forces this realistic play. In a similar fashion, the system rewards you for spreading your troops out and other realistic game play.&#10;&#10;Another unique feature of the game is its use of Proficiency and Casualty ratings to differentiate squads in areas besides just morale.&#10;&#10;Ghost Panzer is a STAND ALONE GAME, but is also the second in a series.&#10;&#10;Band of Brothers: Screaming Eagles was the first in the series and followed the U.S. 101st Airborne Division.&#10;&#10;Other games under research are &quot;The Old Breed&quot; (the US 1st Marine Division) and a module that follows Commonwealth forces.&#10;&#10;Other Key Links:&#10;&#10;Designing a Division&#10;&#10;",

Players rolls six dice instead of five and there are now different combos to mitigate against tough zombie-filled rolls. Additionally, players can now use followers to soak damage coming in from zombies.&#10;&#10;The game ends either when one player dies, the Town Line comes out of the locations deck, or when the Mutant Zombie has been put down once and for all.

Well, it was...&#10;&#10;Terrible skeletons have arisen with a creepy clatter from their graves across the realms' ancient cemeteries. Those scouts that return report endless streams of bony hordes marching toward each kingdom, ravaging the lands as they come. Faced with this sudden threat, even your once friendly neighbors seem to have turned against you as they withdraw to their keeps to defend their own frightened kingdoms, focusing on their own villages and tower.&#10;&#10;Your kingdom is at siege by the living dead. You raise troops, build walls, lay traps, prepare magical spells and even wake your pet dragon. Hopefully they can be slowed, or if you're devilishly crafty, they can be turned toward those traitorous adjoining kingdoms. In this battle, your best asset is your brave and proud hero, who stands ready to slay those piles of walking bones. Alas, he can't fight everywhere, so if things get truly desperate, you could offer them your treasure to get some relief.&#10;&#10;The ivory invaders want somewhere to call their own to live out their death in peace, and they have their eye sockets on you! Will you hold out, or will your home become the retirement village of the damned...?&#10;&#10;Bad Bones is a game in which you must survive an invasion of ever more numerous and dangerous skeletons. The invasion cannot be defeated, so you must outlast your opponents to win the day. At your disposal are a range of weapons that defeat, slow, or even deflect the skeletons towards the other players. The game ends when one player's tower or village is wiped out.&#10;&#10;A game turn takes place in four phases:&#10;&#10;1] Hero Movement and Combat: Move your hero and eliminate the skeletons from the destination square.&#10;2) Trap Placement: Place or remove traps on your personal board.&#10;3) Skeletons Move: Move the skeletons forward, damaging your tower or your village if they move far enough.&#10;4) Skeletons Spawn: Place new skeletons among the streams and on the edges of the player boards.&#10;&#10;Each phase happens simultaneously for all players on their own player board, which means a game with up to six players can take only thirty minutes. Multiple copies of the game can be combined to play with as many players as you have space for, and the game can also be played solo. The rules are simple to explain and understand, with several strategic variations for experts.&#10;&#10;The basic game is competitive - the surviving player with the most points wins. The advanced rules include a cooperative mode where all the players must survive, in which case they all win.&#10;&#10;",

Every cyclist enjoys the benefits of a free base movement which varies according to his specialty and according to the hexagon at the beginning of his movement. After this kind of movement every racer can add a paying movement. Therefore, the race is based on the riders' energy management: initially the riders are all inside the peloton, where it is easier to save energy, but then they will have to find the proper moment to break away to open the definitive gap ahead of the peloton.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Hell of the North&quot; is a slang term for a one-day bicycle race originally from Paris to Roubaix that includes many sections of cobbled roads, sections that often lead to damaged bikes, falls and unexpected race results. A mix of new terrain, including cobblestoned sections, is included in the game with forty new tracks on twenty hexagonal tiles. New miniatures are included that match the size of those in the original game, and the game includes &quot;new rider characteristics&quot;, according to Ghenos' Alfredo Genovese, to go with the miniatures. While game play is similar to that of the original game, the rules have been revised and updated.&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Leader 1&#10;    Giro d&#039;Italia: The game&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "In the 12th Century, in the north of Italy, there were strong cities, ruled by themselves with their own territories and army and each one with own characteristics. They were called COMUNI. The relationship among them was a more or less a pacific coexistence but the cultural, military and Economic competition was always very high.&#10;In this game each player rules a particular COMUNE and has to increase the wealth of the city. To do this he must build structures that are the core of the Economic, Military, Cultural and Religious life.&#10;At the same time all the player must be aware of the invasion that can come from outside and if necessary must be able to collaborate to defeat them.&#10;&#10;Comuni is a game of strategy. The core of the game is trying to acquire &quot;projects of buildings&quot; (cards) that can be automatically transformed in buildings and protection walls (and subsequent upgrades).&#10;The acquisition of the projects is made through a bidding system.&#10;The buildings can be of four types (Economic, Military Cultural and Religious) that give different resources. The resources give different advantages during the game in the bidding phase, when you transform projects into buildings etc....&#10;The projects cards are divided in four different decks, at the end of each of them, an invasion comes, each time stronger. The invasion hits all players and during the invasion each player must defend his city. The players also can (and have an incentive to) collaborate to fight the aggression together.&#10;At the end of the four invasions the game ends.&#10;The key element of this game is the ability to plan a successful strategy predicting what will be the situation several turns in advance.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Pass with care...&#10;&#10;Many are the paths to power: brute force, subtle deception, cunning trickery. You hold the cards...but you can't keep them all. What will you decide to collect for personal gain? And what are you willing to give up in order to destroy? The Ravens are gathering, many of whom used to be rivals. Will you rise to power or simply be...nevermore.&#10;&#10;Nevermore is a casual-style, card-drafting game in which you quickly build your hand each round, collecting cards you want and poisoning your opponent's hand by passing along cards you think they can't use. Whoever holds the most of a given suit, gains the power of that suit to attack, heal, acquire Light or Shadow magicks and score victory points.&#10;&#10;Will you transform all your rivals into ravens &mdash; or can they regain their human form in time to score enough victory to win?&#10;&#10;&#10;Nevermore can be taught in less than five minutes, yet hides a surprising amount of depth in strategy, as players try to outwit and outmaneuver their opponents. Player &lsquo;transformation&rsquo; replaces player elimination, keeping everyone in the game until the last moment, yet still rewards players who have performed better during the game. That's because a player who has become a Raven cannot win until they can find a way to transform back, but they still play, helping to doom other players and trying to collect one of two specific hands (all of one suit - or - one of every suit) to become human again.&#10;&#10;Short game length encourages multiple plays per session and appeals to players of all skill levels &ndash; with plenty of underhanded plotting and backstabby goodness.&#10;&#10;&#10;Play Overview:&#10;&#10;Players are dealt a hand of 5 cards - but they will not keep them all.&#10;During the drafting phase, players must pass three of those cards to the player on their left. From their new set of five, they must then pass two to the left. Lastly, they will pass one card left - ending the drafting phase with a final drafted hand of five cards. They will have attempted to collect cards from a certain suit (or two) trying to be the player who has the most of that suit this hand - and also carefully managing what they are passing to their opponent, to make sure they don't end up with too powerful a hand.&#10;&#10;During the resolution phase, each suit is called for, one at a time. All players show cards from that suit simultaneously. The player with the most gains the power of the suit - and the strength of the ability is determined by subtracting the second highest total of that suit. Example: I hold three Attack cards. Two other players each hold one Attack card. (3-1=2) I do a 2 point attack on a player I choose. Healing, Victory points and Radiance (which draws a Light Magick card for each you have minus the second highest amount) all work the same way. All but Ravens, who kill cards of other suits in your hand. Example: I have 3 Victory, 1 Attack and 1 Raven. I must choose to sacrifice either 1 Attack or 1 Victory card from my hand as they are Resolved. Certain special hands give additional benefits and/or Victory points.&#10;&#10;If your 5 Health points drop to 0, you become a Raven, still in the game, but unable to win until you can transform back.&#10;&#10;The winner is either the last human player standing - or the first to score 6 Victory points.&#10;&#10;",

Players have only a limited number of pieces with which to construct the inukshuk, so you'll need to be creative and use the three-dimensional pieces in multiple ways, such as to counterbalance other pieces or even build on top of existing pieces. A solution always exists &mdash; you just need to discover it!&#10;&#10;You can choose from two levels of difficulty when playing Tuki to level the playing ground between newcomers and experts.

    "description": "Neuland is a game about logistics and planning.  In the beginning of the game, the land lies undeveloped, a series of blank hexes representing mountains, forests, and grasslands.  Players win by building and using prestige properties that allow them to place their family's coat-of-arms onto the board -- first to place all their coats of arms wins.&#10;&#10;To use these buildings, though, requires the player have the correct raw materials.  Swords and cloth, for example, or coins and paper.   Each one of these materials needs even more basic materials, such as iron ore, coal, and so on backward toward the most basic elements such as food, wood, and stone.&#10;&#10;To cull these materials from the land, one builds buildings -- a Stonecutter's Hut, Smelter, Coin Manufactury, and so on.  Once on the board, buildings can be used by any player, not just the one who built them.&#10;&#10;A player doesn't collect these resources for safekeeping as in The Settlers of Catan or Keythedral.  Instead, resources claimed via buildings must be used up either in the player's current turn or his next one.  If he doesn't, the resources spoil and are removed from the board.&#10;&#10;Essentially, the challenge of the game is one of planning logistical supply chains which will allow one to process these resources most efficiently to build the prestige properties the fastest.  Since it's a perfect information game, one can also see what one's opponents are scheming, and place workers to interrupt their supply chains, possibly causing their resources to spoil and making the player start from zero again.&#10;&#10;Neuland's most interesting innovation is perhaps its Time Track Mechanism, in which players who take less actions in a turn will have turns more frequently, and can forward-plan in order to take a long turn of nearly twenty actions instead of the ordinary maximum of ten.&#10;&#10;Neuland was originally published by eggertspiele in 2004, and republished by Z-man in 2006 with some significant rules changes.  A majority of BGG users seem to strongly prefer the original eggertspiele rules. Also heavily recommended is the rules re-write file available for download here on BGG, for the one that comes with the 2nd edition is nearly incomprehensible.&#10;&#10;",

If the gardener has fewer than five points, the gardeners reset the board and start a new round with three buds of their eight; if the gardener has five or more points, the game ends and he wins!&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "The year is 1947 and you are a member of the thriving movie-making industry of Hollywood. However, it is suspected that there are communists hiding among your small production studio slipping &ldquo;un-Patriotic&rdquo; messages, themes, props, and lines into your movies! Will you be able to find all the communists before your studio is shut down? Or will you be suspected yourself and banned from the industry?&#10;&#10;In the game each player will secretly be a Patriot, Communist, or Rising Star. Each round every player will have a unique Job to perform (such as the Screenwriter, Gaffer, Director, Actor, Editor, etc). These jobs will affect what kind of movie is getting made that round, what cards are in players&rsquo; hands, and who will receive special information. Players can choose to skip their jobs to instead re-roll any two of the dice in the game. At the end of each round the players with stars showing on their dice will get to add a card into the movie.&#10;&#10;The added cards will be shuffled, one will be removed, and the rest will be revealed. The team with the majority of revealed symbols (including the symbols on that round&rsquo;s movie poster) wins the round! Indicate the winning team for the round by placing that team&rsquo;s matching film-strip over the movie poster. The first team to win 4 rounds wins the game! The Rising Star plays both sides by trying to make the game go to 7 rounds and making the 7th round a tie.&#10;&#10;Hollywood 1947 is a social deduction game. You must never show your cards or loyalty to anyone, but you may say whatever you&rsquo;d like about the cards you put into a movie, or about your true allegiance. Open discussion about which cards were added into a movie is encouraged. However, if you are a Communist or the Rising Star, lying will often help you accomplish your goals since the majority of players will be Patriots.&#10;&#10;That&rsquo;s a wrap. Most players get the hang of the game after only a few minutes. So let&rsquo;s go make some movies, but be careful who you trust!&#10;&#10;Hollywood 1947 is the 5th standalone game in the Dark Cities Series by Facade Games. Previous games in the series include Salem 1692, Tortuga 1667, Deadwood 1876, and Bristol 1350.&#10;&#10;You can follow the Kickstarter at this link: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/travishancock/hollywood-1947-a-movie-making-game-of-strategy-and-deception&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "A New Train Adventure Begins!&#10;&#10;The Ticket to Ride Card Game delivers all of the excitement, fun, and nail-biting tension of the original Ticket to Ride board game, but with several unique game-play twists in a new stand-alone, card game format.&#10;&#10;Players collect sets of illustrated Train cards, which are then used to complete Destination Tickets - routes between two cities depicted on each ticket. But before their Train cards can be used, players must face the risk of &quot;train robbing,&quot; where another player may force them to lose their hard-earned cards.&#10;&#10;Contains 96 illustrated train car cards, 46 destination tickets, 6 big city prize cards, and a rulebook.&#10;&#10;Part of the Ticket to Ride series.&#10;&#10;To begin the game, each player is dealt train car cards and destination ticket cards.  All these cards are kept secret from the other players until played or scored.  Each player may keep all his ticket cards, just one or any number in between.  A player's turn has two parts: first the player moves face up train car cards from his Railyard to his face down, On-the-Track stack; second the player may perform one of the following actions: 1) draw more train car cards, 2) place train car cards in his Railyard, or 3) draw destination tickets.  Like the original Ticket to Ride board game, when a player chooses to draw train car cards, he may choose from the five face up cards or draw from the top of the face down deck.  When placing cards in the Railyard, a player may place two or more cards of the same color including locomotives which are wild, or three cards, each of a different color.  Also when placing cards in the Railyard, a player may not play cards of the same color as those currently present in his Railyard nor of the same color as those present in any opponent's Railyard unless he plays more of that color than are present in the opponent's Railyard.  If the player plays more, then the opponent must discard his cards of that color.  This is called &quot;Train robbing.&quot;  When drawing destination tickets, a player draws four and may keep any number of them including none.&#10;&#10;When the train car card deck is exhausted in a two or three player game, each player gets one more turn and the game ends.  In a four player game, completed tickets are scored and discarded train car cards are reshuffled into a new draw deck.  When that deck is exhausted, each player gets one more turn and the game ends.  At the end of the game all tickets not previously scored are scored.  The point values of completed tickets are added to a players score while those of tickets not completed are subtracted.  To complete tickets, players match train car cards in their On-the-Track stack by color and quantity with their tickets.  Each big city bonus is awarded to the player with the most completed tickets having that city.  These bonus points are added to the player's score.  The player scoring the most total points wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Pacific War is a Strategic wargame that takes you from the attack on Pearl Harbor to the climatic summer of 1945&hellip; from Australia to China&hellip; from Burma to Hawaii&hellip; from the defense of Wake Island through the invasion of Guadalcanal culminating in the desperate battles to defend the Japanese Home Islands.&#10;&#10;Players can become familiar with the layered Pacific War systems in the solitaire Engagement scenarios, then fight their way through increasingly panoramic Battle, Campaign, and Strategic two player and multi-player Scenarios. As they learn the game's basic maneuver and combat systems, they will then layer on more advanced systems for Strategic bombing, submarine attacks on merchant shipping, search and detection, amphibious assaults, and extensive Operations driven by their command decisions.&#10;&#10;Pacific War is also a time machine back to the halcyon days of the monster game. However, despite what you may have heard, Pacific War is NOT a monster game, but rather an operational World War II air-land-sea game system that lets you fight EVERY Pacific battle and campaign of significance. The original game came with 21 scenarios. This new edition will add at least half a dozen more. The game gains its monster game reputation from the fact that in order to fight all of these campaigns, you need a large number of counters (over 2000) that represent individual capital ships, cruiser divisions, destroyer squadrons, aircraft groups, and land units ranging from battalions to divisions to corps, with all units individually rated based on their historic performance.&#10;&#10;The game map is an equal area map (two mounted maps) which is the grandfather of the Empire of the Sun map. Each hex is 100 miles and covers the entire Pacific from Hawaii to India and Alaska to Australia. The game will also come with a separate map focused on the Solomon Islands where many of the interesting and balanced scenarios occur. What made Victory Games' Pacific War unique in 1985 remains true in GMT&rsquo;s 2020 edition. The design integrates strategic/operational intelligence into a telescoping time mechanic that allows campaigns to progress in a logical asymmetric flow, accompanied by tense game play. Pacific War is a deep historical simulation, so if this is not what you are looking for in a new purchase, please read no further. So, how is this level of simulation achieved?&#10;&#10;During each monthly turn you bid command points (logistics) to determine initiative (offensive player), with the high bid then activating and launching their forces toward their objectives. Secretly,  your opponent (reaction player) determines the operational intelligence level and their potential to intercept the offensive. As the offensive develops, it comes within range of enemy air and submarine forces that tactically attempt to detect the oncoming attack. The reaction player decides how to defeat the attack based on the intersection of tactical and operational intelligence coupled with available forces and logistics.&#10;&#10;This entire sequence is set within a telescoping time scale (days to hours) that has naval units seamlessly accelerate (from 12 to 30+ knots), searches seek out the enemy, carriers launch air strikes, combat air patrols defend, culminating with torpedo and dive bomber attacks on individual naval targets. At its core, Pacific War&rsquo;s game systems allows you to fight detailed carrier strikes (sequential and simultaneous) with night surface naval actions (float planes, gunfire and torpedo salvos) integrated with large scale ground offensives on the Asian mainland (e.g., Malaya, Burma, and China) and of course amphibious invasions (e.g., Java, Guadalcanal, and Leyte). If you are looking for a detailed and interactive operational simulation of the War in the Pacific, this is the game for you!&#10;&#10;So, what will change in the new version? The structure and feel of the design will be unchanged, so if you played it in your youth, you already know how to play. That said, a devoted number of players have been playing this game for 35 years and I have incorporated the best of their feedback into this new and final edition for this title. I am going over each scenario and updating them with information that I did not have available back in 1985. For example, I now have several Japanese translations of their official records that were only published in the last few years. Toward this end, I am adding at least six new campaign and strategic scenarios, so you can experience the entire panorama of the war in a long afternoon .&#10;&#10;The key question that I consider when buying a new game is will it hit the table? The owners and reviewers who created the game's reputation were excited that Pacific War had a layered set of scenarios that incorporated fifteen-minute solitaire learning engagements, two hour battles (such as Coral Sea and Santa Cruz that were used in a decade of tournaments), two to eight hour Campaigns (such as Malaya, Guadalcanal and Breaking the Bismarck barrier), and of course the Strategic scenarios that cover the entire war from a single year to the entire war. Will you ever play the entire war? It's unlikely (to date I have only done it three times). However, Pacific War is an operational level game and the Campaign scenarios are the heart and soul of this game system. Most play in an afternoon to completion. So, will it hit the table? Only you can answer that question, but from a time and learning perspective this game will support any time commitment you wish to make, to include the 100+ hour Strategic Scenario.&#10;&#10;The other question that was not asked back in 1985, but to many is important in 2020 is &quot;does Pacific War have a solitaire &lsquo;Bot system?&quot; The answer is no, with an explanation. The only game decision that cannot reasonably be made is the Operations bidding mechanic and the original game included a solitaire bidding mechanic which will be retained. I will look to see if there are any other similar decisions, such as surface action range bids that I have already added. Thereafter, you will need to play both sides. Due to the history and the game system you will likely not notice as you experience the war&rsquo;s narrative unfold before you. So, although Pacific War will not have a &lsquo;Bot (not even sure how to do that with over 25 scenarios), the game will handle all the interactive bids decisions. If you want a full-blown solitaire opponent, this is not the game for you.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher's website&#10;&#10;GAME CONTENTS AS RECEIVED:&#10;&#10;    2 Mounted Maps (22&quot;x 34&quot; each)&#10;    1 Paper map (17&quot;x 22&quot;), subset of mounted maps&#10;    10 coutersheets&#10;        2 sheets of 9/16&quot; counters, 384 total including 14 blanks - ships&#10;        8 sheets of 1/2&quot; counters, 2240 total including 12 blanks - everything else&#10;    &#10;    5 booklets&#10;        1 Core Rules Booklet, 68 pages, with index&#10;        1 Engagement Scenario Rules Booklet, 40 pages, subset of Core Rules Booklet with index&#10;        1 Battle Scenario Rules Booklet, 44 pages, subset of Core Rules Booklet with index&#10;        1 Scenario Booklet, with 34 scenarios - 8 engagement, 12 battle, 9 campaign, and 5 strategic scenarios, 72 pages&#10;        1 Battle of the Coral Sea (Extended Example of Play) Booklet, 16 pages&#10;    &#10;    13 displays&#10;        1 Operation Display (8.5&quot; x 22&quot;)&#10;        1 Allied Task Force Display (8.5&quot; x 11&quot;)&#10;        1 Allied Force/Task Force Display (8.5&quot; x 11&quot;)&#10;        2 Allied Force Displays (8.5&quot; x 11&quot; each)&#10;        1 Allied Screen (11&quot; x 34&quot;)&#10;        1 Allied Player Display (11&quot; x 34&quot;)&#10;        1 Japanese Force/Task Force Display (8.5&quot; x 11&quot;)&#10;        2 Japanese Force Displays (8.5&quot; x 11&quot; each)&#10;        1 Japanese Task Force Display (8.5&quot; x 11&quot;)&#10;        1 Japanese Screen (11&quot; x 34&quot;)&#10;        1 Japanese Player Display (11&quot; x 34&quot;)&#10;    &#10;    1 Pad of Replacement Record Sheets&#10;    2 Ten Sided Dice (one orange, one blue)&#10;&#10;&#10;(all Booklets and Displays in Color)&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "In the late 18th century, the Industrial Revolution starts. The first factories were founded by businessmen like Richard Arkwright, who ran the first factory for spinning wool with machines like the &quot;Spinning Jenny&quot; and the water frame.&#10;&#10;In &quot;Arkwright: The Card Game&quot;, you run a business and will employ workers in your different factories to produce and sell goods. The more workers, the more goods that can be sold &mdash; but be prepared for crises and some stiff competition.&#10;&#10;The game is played over three decades (1770/1780/1790), split up into four rounds per decade. On your turn, you play new cards from your hand to open factories and upgrade existing ones, select improvements, improve factory quality, build machines, and employ new workers. You can also pay money to improve your shareholdings, and take out loans if you require more money for production costs. After the actions phase, you can improve your abilities by advancing your development markers on your player board, or take one of the available development cards.&#10;&#10;Then, the production phase starts, where every player who owns a factory of the current good produces those goods. The market fluctuates with the general demand, so the demand may be lower than the value of your current good, lowering your profit. Workers must be paid, and machines need regular maintenance, so you can possibly lose money instead of turning a profit. Selling enough of one good improves your share value, and there are bonuses for having the highest appeal. Lastly, if you can&rsquo;t sell your goods to the home market, you can ship them overseas or store them for future rounds.&#10;&#10;After the final round of the last decade, the game ends. Players then sell all goods left in their storehouses, reduce the number of shares they hold by the number of loans they took, and reduce their share value based on their personal shipping track. Each player then multiplies the number of their shares by their share value to determine their end score. The player with the highest end score wins the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The railroad is being built, and to you and the other gangs in the badlands of South Dakota, this means one thing: cold, hard cash. As a cowboy on the wrong side of the law you know just how to take control of this shanty-town: threaten, fight, and kill off your rivals.&#10;&#10;Deadwood is a wild-and-wooly board game with a quick and deadly twist on classic worker placement games. Your gang consists of three different classes of cowboys with different strengths: greenhorns, gunslingers, and trail bosses. Cowboys ride into town to gain control of (annex) buildings and fight other gangs' cowboys in shootouts.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, the town of Deadwood consists of the Town Hall, the Church, the Sheriff's Office, the Saloon, and four other randomly drawn buildings. Additional buildings are constructed whenever a cowboy annexes the Town Hall. Each building has at least one unique ability that is used immediately, with some buildings offering more long-term advantages.&#10;&#10;A cowboy accesses these advantages by controlling the building. To gain control a player simply places one of his gang on a building tile, &quot;annexing&quot; it. Other gang leaders can try to gain control of your buildings through shootouts. The player that instigates the shootout receives a Wanted Poster token; the more cowboys you try to kill off, the more Wanted Poster tokens you collect, and the higher the fine you must pay at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Deadwood can end one of three ways: the Train Station is placed on the board once the railroad is built and completed, there are no more Wanted Poster tokens in the Crime Pool, or any player has no more cowboys alive. The player with the most cash at the end of the game is the winner!&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "The first three games in the Series: Men of Iron (GMT): Men of Iron, Infidel: The Supremacy of Cavalry in the Crusader Era &#226;&#128;&#147; 11th-12th Century, and Blood & Roses, plus the Battle of Agincourt from C3i #22.&#10;&#10;The game that started it all, Men of Iron, covers the re-emergence of infantry in the early 14th century, along with a more perceptive understanding of the value of combined-arms warfare and the effective use of defensive terrain. The scenarios highlight the key elements that made these battles so fascinating: the defensive power of the longbow, especially when used in coordination with dismounted, or even mounted, men-at-arms. Agincourt covers Henry V&rsquo;s famous victory during the Hundred Years War.&#10;&#10;The second volume in the  Men of Iron series, Infidel: The Supremacy of Cavalry in the Crusader Era &#226;&#128;&#147; 11th-12th Century, focuses on the major battles of the early Crusades era between Christians and the Muslims. This is a period that saw cavalry reign supreme and pitted the European mounted, armored men-at-arms - which relied on furious and direct charges with sword and lance - against the Eastern European/Turkish light cavalry tactics - focusing on the efficiency of its mounted archers.&#10;&#10;Blood & Roses  focuses on the battles of the Wars of the Roses in England, between 1455 and 1487. This was warfare in which most men were truly &quot;of iron&quot;, heavily and totally armored to such a point that their mobility was suspect. It also featured the introduction of gunpowder &ndash; mostly field artillery &ndash; in noticeable numbers. And while many English men-at-arms were mounted, they did so almost entirely for transport. Most fighting was on foot &hellip; and it was quite vicious.&#10;&#10;There will be a series rulebook, with a few rules still applying only to a specific game, and the games will have all errata applied to their battle book. The color setups a la Blood & Roses and Arquebus: Men of Iron Volume IV &#226;&#128;&#147; The Battles for Northern Italy 1495-1544 will show up in all battle books. Men of Iron will see some battle changes, a few of which will involve new/changed counters.&#10;&#10;The series is designed for quick learning and easy play. Game rules are short, there are no turns - play is continual, with opportunities to steal play from your opponent - and combat resolution is a single dieroll. Playing time is about 1-to-3 hours per battle.&#10;&#10;The series is also for the gamer who enjoys playing solitaire. The system is designed for both individual and face-to-face play without any loss in insight or fun. It allows a player or players to see what happened in these famous battles and why. There are no purpose-built solitaire rules, but many players play that way.&#10;&#10;The units feature longbows, crossbows, men-at-arms (mounted, dismounted, and unhorsed), hobilars, genitors, nasty Scots with axes, slingers, pike infantry, knights, heavy cavalry, medium cavalry, light cavalry archers, archers, camp followers, handgunners, and artillery! And the commanders! The great English King, Edward III and his son, The Black Prince, William Wallace and The Bruce, Captal de Buch.  Crusaders Stephen of Blois, Bohemond of Taranto, Raymond of Toulouse, Bishop Adhemar of Le Puy, the leper King Baldwin IV, Raynald of Chatillon, and King Richard I. Saracen leaders Kilij Arslan, Kerbogha, Atabeg of Mosul,  Fatimid Vizier al-Afdal Shahanshah, Soqman the Artukid of Diyar-Bakr and Aleppo, and Saladin. King Henry VI, Richard, Duke of York, King Edward IV, Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick, King Richard III, and Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond (and founder of the Tudor dynasty).&#10;&#10;The battles included in the Men of Iron tri-pack are:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Dorylaeum &ndash; Northwest Anatolia, 1 July 1097 - The Crusader line of march, including the people&rsquo;s Crusade and Peter the hermit, as well as all the great 1st Crusade Leaders, are &ldquo;ambushed&rdquo; by Kilij Arslan and his crack Seljuk cavalry.   &#10;    Antioch &ndash; Northern Syrian, 28 June 1098 - The exhausted, starving and depleted Crusaders &ndash; they had few horses left &ndash; have just taken Antioch and are now faced with a large Turkish army, under Kerbogha, sent to retake the city.   &#10;    Ascalon &ndash; Southern Palestine, 12 August 1099 - The Crusaders, having seized Jerusalem, turn south to fend off the suddenly active large army of the Fatimids, with their crack Mamluk heavy cavalry.   &#10;    Harran &ndash; Crusader Kingdom of Antioch/Edessa, 7 May 1104 - Baldwin II of Edessa seeks to maintain control of his little kingdom in northern Syria, something Soqman, Atabeg of Damascus, is not happy to allow. One of the first major Crusader defeats.   &#10;    Montgisard &ndash; Frankish Kingdom of Jerusalem, 25 November 1177 - Saladin attempts to destroy a small army from the Kingdom of Jerusalem with an army more than five times its size. Though there are only 400 knights, the Crusaders are led by the remarkable Baldwin IV, The Leper King. The outcome - one of the greatest Crusader victories. See if you can carry off this stunning upset!   &#10;    Arsuf - Ayyubid Kingdom of Jerusalem, 7 September 1191 - The classic battle between Richard I Lionheart and the Ayyubid Army of Saladin highlighting the major facets of each army in an unusual moving battle.&#10;    Falkirk - Scotland, 22 July 1298 - Wallace's great disaster, despite his massive schiltron. Good infantry is fine, but it needs support. The ultimate solitaire scenario. &#10;    Courtrai - Flanders, 11 July 1302 - The Battle of the Golden Spurs. The Flemish shook the elite French army with one of the earliest displays of the power of solid infantry using defensive positions. &#10;    Bannockburn - Scotland, 23-24 June 1314 - Robert the Bruce's famous triumph over a numerically superior, but literally bogged down English army. &#10;    Crecy - France, 26 August 1346 - The first great battle of the Hundred Years War. It showed that infantry, supported by archers, could defeat the best knights in Europe. &#10;    Poitiers - France, 19 September 1356 - The French fight dismounted this time and almost win. But the longbow, and solid English infantry prevail again. &#10;    Najera - Castile, 3 April 1367 - The Black Prince goes to Spain with a marvelous combined arms force to further English plans of &quot;expansion&quot;. &#10;    Agincourt &ndash; Artois, 25 October 1415 &ndash; Henry V wins a mighty victory against the flower of French chivalry. &#10;    1st St. Albans &ndash; Hertfordshire, 22 May 1455 - Marks the first major engagement in the Wars of the Roses. Richard, Duke of York and his ally, Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick, defeated the Lancastrians under Edmund, Duke of Somerset, who was killed during the battle. York also captured Henry VI and forced Henry to appoint him Constable of England  &#10;    Blore Heath &ndash; Staffordshire, 23 September 1459 - Greatly outnumbered Yorkist infantry used the longbow and a defensive position to drive off the Lancastrian Men-at-Arms. &#10;    2nd St. Albans &ndash; Hertfordshire, 17 February 1461 - The Lancastrians drove the Yorkists out of the town and then destroyed Warwick&rsquo;s strangely deployed army, even when sturdily defended by hedges, caltrops and spiked netting. &#10;    Towton &ndash; Yorkshire, 29 March 1461 - Easily biggest battle in the box and the biggest in the entire series. It uses over 200 combat units and, much like the actual battle, will probably take a long time to play. It is mostly crash and bash, with little room for maneuver, all fought in a blinding snowstorm!!  &#10;    Barnet &ndash; Greater London Area, 14 April 1471 - A classic battle of planned deployments, but overlapping wings, cries of treason in the lines, fog of war (actual fog), and the excellent use of reserves. &#10;    Tewksbury &ndash; Gloucestershire, 4 May 1471 - A battle that shows one of the key terrain features of the battles in this era, extensive hedges and thick underbrush in otherwise clear fields. &#10;    Bosworth &ndash; Leicestershire, 22 August 1485 - The best-known battle of the wars and the tragic (I think) death of King Richard III in a battle he should have won. Using the latest information as to where the battle took place, let&rsquo;s see if you can cancel out the Tudor dynasty.&#10;&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;Five 22x34&rdquo; maps&#10;Seven counter sheets (six and one-half 1/2&rdquo; + one-half 9/16&rdquo;)&#10;One 36 page series rulebook&#10;Three battle books (two 24 page and one 36 page)&#10;Six player aid cards (four 11x17&rdquo; and two 11x25.5&rdquo;)&#10;Two flight point charts (8.5 x 11&rdquo;)&#10;Two ten-sided dice&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
