No humans have ever stepped on this magical land, and you are the leaders of its hunter-gatherer tribes of sentient animals, collecting food, developing inventions, and erecting monuments in honor of the ancient gods to fulfill their spiritual needs. The winner in this competition will ensure happiness and well-being for their tribe members, and he or she will be praised as the arch leader of all the tribes!&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to have the most Happiness Points at the end of the sixth round (season). There are several different ways to score points, but the most important activity in the game is to send your tribe members (called here &quot;tribers&quot;) to various spaces on the main board and take actions corresponding to them.&#10;&#10;Uluk mostly makes use of the classic worker placement mechanics. The players send their tribers to spaces on the main board to build monuments and gather raw resources. The resources gathered are stored on each player's tribe board and  may then be processed into food. Feeding your tribers brings you HPs and lets you win the game after the sixth season. A single season is divided into six phases in which the players take their actions in a clockwise order:&#10;&#10;Errand phase - place your tribers on the main board&#10;Harvest phase - gather resources from the main board&#10;Processing phase - process raw resources from your tribe board into food&#10;Feeding phase - spend food on feeding your tribers&#10;Ecology phase - adjust the harvest levels (quantity of resources available) on the main board&#10;Clean-up phase - build monuments and prepare for the next season&#10;&#10;Developing inventions (in the form of invention cards with different symbols) enhances the effectiveness of your food processing, and collecting sets of different symbols brings extra points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Quality or quantity? Racing to build parody video games such as 'Pinky Gear Solid' and 'Elder May Cry', you are a game developer competing for the components needed to create games in four genres: RPG, Fighting, Music and First Person Shooter games.&#10;&#10;Each video game has some basic components (title, character, gear) that are essential, but can also include optional components (extra characters, gear upgrades, easter eggs) that increase the video game's market value. The video game components (cards) also double as money for purchases and auctions, so you're constantly struggling to manage your hand and make trade-offs on what to acquire and what to give up in return.&#10;&#10;The best video games get victory point bonuses but the game ends immediately as soon as any developer releases four video games to market. So you have to decide: do I wait to put in that snazzy Easter Egg and create the best video game or do I beat the competition by releasing more games to the market?&#10;&#10;Pink Godzilla Dev Kit is a light/medium weight card game for 2-4 players, with enough interesting decisions and tension to satisfy serious gamers but not overwhelm casual gamers.&#10;&#10;The game parodies everything from retro Nintendo classics to the latest Japanese imports featuring a pantheon of offbeat characters like Pixel, the Elders, Jumpman, the Ninja Suppressors, the Good, Evil and Neutral Guardians and Pink Godzilla himself. The artwork for the cards is original, refreshing, and oozing with theme.&#10;&#10;Win or lose, serious and casual gamers alike will enjoy being able to create parodies of their favorite video games.&#10;&#10;Home Page: http://www.pinkgodzillagames.com/devkit/&#10;&#10;",

Players are in control of one of these two districts, and by drafting and playing cards depicting the city's Characters, they attempt to secure the support of the councils and have the best inhabitants.&#10;&#10;The game begins with players drafting the 64 character cards to form two 32 card decks, one for each player.  During the player's turn, the player gains actions to play Character cards into his district.  Each character belongs to one of the four cliques, and many have special abilities, called Traits, that occur when they are placed into a district from a player's hand.  Additionally, at the end of a player's turn, the player will place a card from his hand face down on one of the council cards.  When a Character with the Ksari trait is played in a district, the corresponding Clique Council is convened, and the player with the highest value of face down cards wins the support of the convened council.&#10;&#10;Players score points for the Characters in their districts, as well as points for the Council support they have received.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Each Anno Domini set consists of 336 cards, with a description of a historical event on one side of the card, and the year (and sometimes specific date) in which it happened on the other.&#10;&#10;Each player receives nine of these cards (or less, if you want the game to be shorter), and may only look at the descriptions. Players then put in turn a card on the table, *trying* to put theirs in chronological order. A player may, instead of adding a card, claim that the order in which the cards were put is incorrect. In this case all cards are turned over and the correct years revealed.&#10;If the order was correct then the doubting player receives two cards and skips a turn. If the order was incorrect then the previous player, who accepted the order as correct, receives three cards. The first player that gets rid of all the cards wins.&#10;&#10;Bluffing is as least as important as knowledge in this game. Most events are rather obscure or are hard to date exactly, so this ain&rsquo;t no game for the nerds/geeks of this world, even they might think so, because it&rsquo;s full of surprises and pure fun. Highly Recommended, because Anno Domini is a blast to play, is a very enjoyable social event and you even learn something from it.&#10;&#10;Unfortunately there is no English edition in existence, but this game could be a good way, to improve your already existing German skills or a very good reason, to learn the German language in the first place.&#10;&#10;The Set &quot;Anno Domini - Seefahrer &amp; Flieger&quot; contains historical events related to sailors &amp; airmen, can be played as a stand alone or together with the other sets, which is the best way of playing it.&#10;&#10;Part of the Anno Domini series&#10;&#10;",

Unlike typical puzzle games where pieces merely stack up, the elements in Shallow Sea can activate, deactivate, and even move, creating exciting combos and thought-provoking dilemmas that keep you on your toes.&#10;&#10;Easy to learn yet challenging to master, you&rsquo;ll find yourself returning to its depths time and time again. Dive in and discover the wonders of Shallow Sea today!&#10;&#10;- The goal of the Shallow Sea is to be the player with the highest points at the end of the game.&#10;- On your turn, choose a combination of Fish and Coral or Sealife tile and place them in an empty space on your ocean board.&#10;- When fish in the matching color gather around a Coral tile, the coral is completed. Flip the completed tile over! Completed Coral becomes a home for fish. Choose carefully which fish will inhabit the coral, keeping the puzzle and ecosystem cards in mind.&#10;- By strategically arranging corals to fit the color puzzle, you can complete multiple coral tiles with fewer fish.&#10;- Use Seashells to lure fish and move them around! Create amazing combos by completing multiple tiles in a single turn.&#10;- Each Sealife Tile requires specific patterns of fish or coral. Invite a variety of creatures to enrich your ocean!&#10;- Customize your ocean to match the distinct scoring requirements of the Ecosystem cards.&#10;- The game concludes as soon as there are only 4 empty spaces left on each player's Ocean. When the game ends, the player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;",

The demoralized French have concentrated their forces, but the British attack is ferocious. Who will take the prize?&#10;&#10;This game features only modest complexity and a focused scope employing low unit density on the map (20 pieces or less) and dramatic, fast playing turns. It is the addition of &lsquo;story-driven&rsquo; random event cards and night game turns that provide the operational pauses and &quot;friction of war&quot; that give players a great feel for the parry-and-thrust of a Napoleonic grand battle as the armies close to bayonet-point to see which will break first!&#10;&#10;Game Components:&#10;&gt; One 8-page, color instructions booklet, with Standard and Optional rules included&#10;&gt; One sheet of Exclusive rules.&#10;&gt; 40 color, die-cut 5/8&quot; mounted game pieces&#10;&gt; 12 random event cards&#10;&gt; One 11&quot; x 17&quot; color game map&#10;&gt; Two color player aid sheets&#10;&#10;Scale: Each unit is 1 division, each hex is about 800 meters, and each turn is roughly 3 daylight hours (or 10 night hours).&#10;&#10;Part of the Napoleonic 20 series.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "When Lana and her father return to their seaside hometown to help clear the debris of a big storm, Lana remembers how much she's missed the ocean &mdash; and the strong, reassuring presence of her aunt. As Lana explores the familiar beach, she discovers something incredible: a colony of aquicorns, small magical seahorse-like creatures that live in the coral reef. Lana rescues an injured aquicorn and cares for it with the help of her aunt, who may know more about these strange creatures than she's willing to admit. But when a second storm threatens to reach the town, choices made many years ago about how to co-exist with the sea start to rise to the surface. Lana realizes she will need to find the strength to stand on her own, even when it means standing up to the people who she has always relied on to protect her.&#10;&#10;In the co-operative game The Aquicorn Cove Board Game, 2-4 players take on the roles of members of a small fishing village struggling to survive while maintaining a balance with the natural world. To win, the villagers must feed and grow their village, while helping to restore the health of the reef and aquatic ecosystem. The villagers are fortunate, though, and the waters of their cove are home to the beautiful and benevolent aquicorns, as well as the wondrous reef guardian Aure, who can help them both to understand the impact humans are having on the environment and to save the village.&#10;&#10;",

The victory of a team comes through successful communication, trust, and a good dose of bluff.&#10;&#10;The game is highly inspired from Werewolf games, the essential differences are that players usually change team during play, rather than being killed, and that discussions are not public: People must investigate by little groups, moving from one to another.&#10;&#10;There is a game master, the Computer, who organizes the game.&#10;At the beginning, each player gets one secret role.&#10;Each round is alternatively Day and Night.&#10;There are 2 teams: Healthy and Mutant.&#10;&#10;Mutants act during the night and can do two actions each night (2 actions for the entire team):&#10;&#10;     Mutate a healthy character (unless he's resistant).&#10;     OR Kill a character.&#10;     AND Paralyze another character in order to skip his turn.&#10;&#10;&#10;The 2 doctors act during the night and can do one action each night:&#10;&#10;     Threat a character each (unless he's root mutant).&#10;     OR Kill a single character together.&#10;&#10;&#10;During the night, other roles can also act, such as the Psychologist who knows mutant or healthy state of a chosen character, or the Computer Scientist who guesses the current number of mutants.&#10;&#10;During the day, everybody can talk, then secretly vote in order to execute 1 character.

To begin the game, each player is dealt 7 cards and the remainder of the deck is placed in the centre to form the draw pile, then turn over the top card to start the discard pile.&#10; The player to the left of the dealer begins by looking at the card on top of the discard pile. The top card tells you how many cards you must discard through its colour and the number: e.g. if it has the number 1 on it, you must discard 1. Note that the numbers on the cards serve no other function in the game. The colour/colours on the top card determine which colour cards you must discard. Some cards will only have 1 colour, others will have 2.&#10; If you have the required cards place them down on the draw pile to end your turn. Remember &ndash; the card that you place on top will determine the next players go. If you cannot discard the required cards, pick one up from the draw pile (this is good) if you can then put down the cards, place them on the discard pile. If not, declare this to the group by saying &ldquo;Nope!&rdquo;. Your turn is now over. &#10;There are also wild cards which contain all four colours and can be used to complete any set. In addition the pack contains 3 actions cards: Reset cards which end your go and force the next player to put down any card, Invisible cards which mean the next player must play as normal but refer to the card directly underneath the invisible card, and Nominate cards which mean you can nominate another player by name and declare how man cards they must discard: 1, 2 or 3. &#10;This addictive colour-matching contest can be played with 2 or more players and is suitable for 6 years and above.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

In the flight and combat model, new rules additions take into account the effects of high aircraft speeds on induced drag when turning, excess firepower points, lift-vector aiming effects and much more. The night combat rules and night fighting rules have been greatly expanded to better model the cat-and-mouse aspect of the night war. All in all, you will want to catch up to the state of the art with this rulebook.&#10;&#10;Note that the aircraft data cards from all of the previous games and FW supplements are still usable, as are the scenarios from the previous games, although, with regards to the scenarios, you will have to interpret from the scenario description the flight attitude that the planes are likely starting with.&#10;&#10;In the future, updated scenario books will be available to bring the Over the Reich, Achtung! Spitfire!, and Whistling Death games all up to third edition standards.&#10;&#10;This Rulebook also includes the updated Third Edition Play Aids Booklet.&#10;&#10;This 32 page booklet contains all of the game tables, play aid guides, etc. to model air combat, aircraft flight, air-to-ground combat and air-naval combat. &#10;These tables are for use with the THIRD edition Fighting Wings game rules. You must also PURCHASE or own the third edition rules to understand and use these tables. Many sections are not backwards compatible with earlier edition game rules.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

From here you have to make some hard choices which way you develop. Do you build mining colonies on systems with deposits, and use these riches to build high value colonies? Or will you invest in science, researching the weird and wonderful treasures of this new galaxy to earn renown? You can choose to cut corners and use more nefarious means to build your colonies, or focus on space ships that don't require a system for support that can aid your economy.&#10;&#10;Whatever path you choose, as a pioneer you can only hold onto 4 systems at a time, and in order to keep claiming worlds that earn you renown you must relinquish control of systems to your faction at a certain point.

    "description": "From the publisher's web page:&#10;&#10;Taking Soldier Kings as its base, Soldier emperor covers the Napoleonic Wars in Europe, 1803-1815. There are 180 huge and thick playing pieces like those in Granada, 165 smaller marker pieces, two large hard-mounted game boards like that in Granada, and 64 cards.&#10;&#10;The map stretches from Britain to Persia, North Africa to Norway. Europe is divided into areas, each of them rated for their resources, manpower potential, and defense value. Armies move along the routes that connect these areas, and the object of the game is to conquer and hold as much territory as you can. Soldier Emperor is very true to history but is easily playable by anyone with an interest in games or history.&#10;&#10;This is probably the first time that Persia has appeared in a Napoleonic wargame, but the Persians fought the Russians twice in this period and also threatened war with the Turks. They receive two armies, plus their fine leader, Crown Prince Abbas Mirza.&#10;&#10;Turkey's eastern border regions are shown as well: Kurdistan and Baghdad appear. Unlike other games, the Turkish player can't operate with a secure right flank but must worry about his or her &quot;back door.&quot; The Turks begin with rather mediocre leadership, Ebubekir and Bayrakdar on land and Seyit Ali on the sea. But once Sultan Selim is overthrown (an event brought about by card play), Turkish leadership improves as junior generals are promoted. The Turks also can deploy the Banner of the Prophet, using Mohammed's ancient flag to inspire their troops.&#10;&#10;Austria has a large army, one good general for most of the game (Archduke Charles) and a slim chance to receive an excellent one (Radetzky) and another good one (Frimont) late in the game. The rest of the Austrian generalship is not so good, and the empire is surrounded by potential enemies.&#10;&#10;Prussia is small and relatively weak, but does have two fair generals (Yorck and Bl&uuml;cher) and a good army. But if the army is lost in action Prussia's low resources and manpower will make the losses difficult to replace.&#10;&#10;France of course has Napoleon, some other very good generals, and the largest army in the game. The French player also has the Imperial Guard. France has a powerful economy and strong starting position &ndash; and a large target painted right on the French player's back. France's revolutionary ways bring its player a number of game advantages (in movement and battle) and some disadvantages as well (in diplomacy, at least until France's enemies have been beaten into submission).&#10;&#10;Britain has the expected advantages: large income from overseas trade, a powerful fleet, and Lord Nelson. They also have a couple of lesser admirals (Collingwood and Jervis) and the outstanding Duke of Wellington to lead the land forces. But the army is small, and hard to replace if lost.&#10;&#10;Spain can call out guerrillas if invaded, and will need every advantage to offset its weak economy, poor generalship and second-rate army. The fleet is good, and Gravina is a good admiral. Spain also has access to several minor countries that others can't easily reach, and a starting position in Italy that can allow for quick expansion (Etruria, held by a Spanish prince in 1803).&#10;&#10;Russia, the final player-controlled country, has a vast land area, a strong position on the edge of the board, and a large and strong army. Leadership is good, with Kutusov and Kamensky the best of the lot plus Senyavin to command the fleet. But as in Soldier Kings, the Russian player will be chronically short of cash and willing to do many things to change this.&#10;&#10;As in Soldier Kings, the game can be played with fewer than seven players, all the way down to two. Card play drives the action, with players able to play cards at any time and thwart their opponents' plans. Play order is determined by each country's initiative, and generals and admirals move their forces from area to area. And like Soldier Kings, combat is simple to resolve but contains many wrinkles of strategy.&#10;&#10;If you liked Soldier Kings, you'll adore Soldier Emperor. Play is fast and furious, strategies are many, and the excitement level is high. A game lasts about four hours, with the campaign game taking somewhat longer.&#10;&#10;",

A craftsman has to be &quot;Auf der Walz&quot; (roughly translated as &quot;on the road&quot;) for three years and one day without ever getting closer than fifty kilometers to home. The young journeyman wears a traditional dress: flared pants, waistcoat, jacket, black hat (as a symbol for freedom), the &quot;Stenz&quot; (traditional curled hiking pole), and the &quot;Charlottenburger&quot; (coarse cloth to wrap up the belongings). They work (for a little bit of money but also for board and lodge) for people on their journey.&#10;&#10;Auf der Walz is a &quot;travel game&quot; with resource management that takes place in the second half of the 19th century. Like life on the Walz, it includes uncertainty and random elements. Each player earns points at the end of each year on the journey and in an end-scoring after that additional one day.&#10;&#10;The engine of the game is a deck of cards. Each player has six cards per year (and an additional card for the last day) and conducts actions with them: traveling, working, finding travel mates, etc. as well as leisure activities: music, writing, painting.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

No ... This game will give you more: lead your ludus glory inside the Coliseum.&#10;&#10;Jugular a lanista, a ludus, a familia, a goal : &#10;The lanista, you the player.  The ludus, your gladiator school.&#10;The familia, your fighters. A goal : The show !&#10;&#10;Jugula a deck of cards :&#10;Game accessory  that will be indispensable to every player, it will consist of 36 cards : 12 deck of Jugula cards for your departure deck. 12 Prima Jugula cards to add to your start deck during the game to boost your strategy. 12 Armatura cards to determine the characteristics of your fighters.&#10;&#10;Facing the audience, the battle has only one purpose: to draw blood! Each Gladiator has a value of attack according to the class of the target. The gladiators are listed in two categories: heavy and light.&#10;&#10;Depending on the tactical situation, your attack will reward a bonus ranging from +0 to +3. Other aspects of the combat environment, as the presence of other gladiators allies or enemies, the support of the crowd will also provide bonuses or penalties to resolve your fight. In Jugula, no dice: to resolve the battle, each player will play one of his cards in hand or will pick one to use the dice on this card. With the added bonus / malus, the show will be provided and the crowd contented!&#10;&#10;The purpose: staging the opponent defeat. Each lanista aligns 4 fighters in the arena. You will be declared the winner if you have: &#10;- knocked out  two opponent gladiators on 4, &#10;or &#10;-  wounded 4 opponent gladiators, &#10;or &#10;- knocked out one opponent gladiator and wounded two others.&#10;&#10;All your fight results, your gladiators&rsquo; improvements, your ludus&rsquo;s performance will be recorded on a ludus sheet -  your ultimate goal, to be the first ludus with 10 Glory Points. As well as developing your fighters, you can hire and train up a staff of servants to grow your business and make your ludus the talk of Rome !&#10;&#10;In summary, for play ... You will need :&#10;- The Jugula rulebook. &#10;- An arena (A 64 squares poster will be inserted in the rulebook)&#10;- A familia of 4 gladiators. &#10;- A pack of Jugula cards per player. &#10;- Two lanistae ... This is to say : you, the player with your strategy, your intelligence of situation, your courage, your cool, your moral strength facing an opponent who wants to see you bite the dust !&#10;&#10;",

The challenges are simple, but there's a catch: Before a player begins a challenge, their friends bet on how difficult the challenge can be made without failing. The friend who makes the challenge the hardest becomes that player's teammate, and they both score if the player can successfully complete the challenge. However, if they upped the stakes too high and the challenger fails, then all other players earn a point, and the challenger and their teammate both lose points. Success is based entirely on whether players are good judges of their friends' abilities.&#10;&#10;",

Each plague event will change each player's hand of cards, usually making you discard specific cards. The game will end after the last plague is revealed and the player with the most pyramid points will be declared the winner.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Saipan &amp; Tinian, Island War Series - Volume I&#10;by Michael Taylor&#10;&#10;Saipan is a simulation of the American invasion and capture of Saipan in the summer of 1944. Part of Admiral Nimitz's Operation Granite II, the seizure of the Marianas was divided into two parts, the Northern Troops Landing Force (NTLF) and the Southern Troops Landing Force (STLF). Saipan and Tinian were the objectives for the NTLF, with Saipan being the immediate objective and Tinian the second. The STLF objective was Guam. Before the Capture of Saipan both the US Navy and the Japanese Navy had powerful carrier based air forces, and with the exception of China based aircraft, no US land based aircraft could reach homeland Japan. After the capture of Saipan only the US Navy had a powerful carrier based air arm, and powerful land based bombers could now bomb Japan relentlessly.&#10;&#10;Tinian is a simulation of the American invasion and capture of Tinian in the summer of 1944. Tinian was the first US Marine Corps sized shore-to-shore operation and it was the first time napalm was used against enemy troops. After its seizure Tinian was developed into the greatest B-29 base in the war. B-29s from Tinian flew 29,000 missions and dropped over 157,000 tons of bombs on Japan by the end of the war, including the two atomic bomb missions flown by the &quot;Enola Gay&quot; and &quot;Bocks Car&quot; against Hiroshima and Nagasaki.&#10;&#10;Saipan Game Components:&#10;17&quot; x 22&quot; map&#10;270 Double-sided game counters&#10;&#10;Tinian Game Components:&#10;11&quot; x 17&quot; map&#10;180 Double-sided counters&#10;&#10;Game scale:&#10;Unit size: Platoon, Company, and Battalion&#10;Scale: Hex scale: 1/2 mile&#10;Game Turn: Each turn represents 12 hours&#10;&#10;The Island War Series game system is a simulation of ground combat in the Pacific during World War II. Each game in the system represents a battle between Allied and Imperial Japanese forces on one of the many Pacific Islands.&#10;The series begins with Vol. I - Saipan/Tinian and will also include Guam - Vol. II , and Attu &amp; Kiska - Vol. III.&#10;&#10;Two sets of rules are provided with each game. The first contains the Standard Rules that are common to all the games in the Pacific Island Series. The second set contains the Exclusive Rules for each game in the system, which includes Special rules, the Initial Deployment and the Reinforcement Schedule. Generally the unit scale is battalion, but there are company and platoon formations represented. The time scale, unless noted in the Exclusive rules, is 1/2 day per turn.&#10;&#10;Due to the nature of the battles covered in the series, all naval and air forces are abstract. This means the main focus of each game is ground combat. The games are designed for two players, but can accommodate multiple players. For example, one player can play the US Marines, one can play the US Army, and the third plays the Japanese.&#10;&#10;This series of games is loosely based on or inspired by several different game systems, including SPI's Island War series and GRD/GDW's Europa series, but many concepts are quite original. The tactical situation for the defender can be described as &quot;against the odds&quot;, which means it will be very difficult for the player playing the  defender to win the game tactically. The victory conditions are designed in such a way that the defender can win by performing better than his historical counterpart. This also puts a lot of pressure on the attacker because he cannot afford to make many mistakes.&#10;&#10;Game features include:&#10;1. Limited intelligence&#10;2. Amphibious Landings&#10;3. Night rules&#10;4. Banzai attacks&#10;5. Coastal Defense units&#10;6. Beachheads and Replacements&#10;7. Fortifications&#10;8. Weather&#10;&#10;",

You may not give specific clues about what you have chosen or how it relates to one or both of the image cards in front of you; only a vague sense of how the choice feels to you.&#10;&#10;One more image card is on display than the number of players, and once you've chosen your target image, you indicate this choice on a numbered secret dial. Once all players have chosen, they reveal their choices. If you're the only one who picked an image, then you take that image card and cover one of the two images in front of you. If everyone chose different cards, then you win the round! If, however, not everyone chose different cards, then you lose the round and everyone who chose &quot;incorrectly&quot; draws a new image card at random from the deck to replace one of theirs. Sweep any remaining image cards from the center, then reveal the appropriate number of image cards to start a new round.&#10;&#10;If you lose a round for the third time, you lose the game; if you manage to complete a number of rounds (7-10) based on the player count before this happens, then you win!

Players explore a vampire infested mansion represented by partly hidden tiles, advancing their 2 personal guards (meeples) from room to room, uncovering the hidden content as they enter each room.&#10;Each room, represented by a tile, allows you to interact with what is inside by playing items (cards) from a limited hand.

Players attempt to reach the garden of the house safely in order to hold one of two available spots that allow a player to claim loot, revealed during exploration.&#10;You win the game with the highest total of gathered points, scored by rescuing villagers, eliminating vampires (unique members from the vampire dynasty scoring more points when collected as a set) and getting hold of valuable items. But beware, as rival guards will hinder your plans and mislead you. When you receive too many vampire bites you might turn into a Vampire yourself, triggering new goals to win the game.

There is a strong emphasis on the roles of the different troop types (infantry, cavalry, and artillery). The other focus is on fatigue, as troops slowly (or not so slowly...) whither away in battle. There is a scenario generator and the game should be played using it or the Grand Campaign, which is easy to do.&#10;&#10;There are guidelines for using the rules with different scales of miniatures, so everything from 6mm to 28mm can be used.&#10;&#10;The game is influenced by action cards, and the fire phases and command choices of each player are partly decided and influenced by playing these action cards from that players deck. Each player has their own deck of action cards that they use during the game.&#10;&#10;There is a free Lite version on the publishers homepage and a commercial full version, that can be bought. Those interested can try the free Lite version before deciding to take the plunge.&#10;&#10;",

Each turn, you select one of your characters and perform two actions. Each character has access to basic actions like moving and challenges as well as several unique abilities that may be performed only by spending ability tokens. Funkoverse uses an innovative &ldquo;cooldown&rdquo; system &mdash; the more powerful the ability, the longer it will take for the ability token to become available again &mdash; so players have to spend their ability tokens wisely. Each character in Funkoverse is unique, so players are encouraged to try out different combinations of characters and items in order to discover their favorite synergies and powerful strategies for the different game scenario&#10;&#10;Funkoverse Strategy Game: Space Jam A New Legacy #100 is a standalone game that includes the characters Bugs Bunny and Lebron James.

    "description": "Based on the second movie, of course. This tri-lingual (English, Spanish, French) crowded MB box contains a whole bunch of thin cardboard 3D buildings; stand up cardboard pieces for the 12 humans and the helicopter, and a bunch of plastic miniatures of the dinosaurs (a T-Rex and some Velociraptors). This is played in teams, the human team trying to get 3 humans off the board via the chopper, and the dinosaur team trying to prevent this. When 3 play, the third player alternates teams.&#10;&#10;The humans can jump between building roofs or can run between them. Unfortunately, the dinosaurs move a lot faster on the ground than the humans (the humans move between marked spaces, the dinosaurs between zones). Buildings have several entry/exit points for the humans but only one for the raptors. Dice indicate how to move humans and dinosaurs; one of the dice has Stop/Go markings which control whether you may roll again or not --making movement harder to predict. Jumping (for humans) and entering buildings (for dinosaurs) is also dice controlled. The T-Rex is confined to a single board edge area; its function is to flush the humans from the starting building -- once he reaches it, all remaining humans are devoured!&#10;&#10;Yes, unlike the first movie game, in this one there is death aplenty. As soon as a dinosaur enters a space with humans in it, even when just passing through, they're all eaten. Tastes like chicken.&#10;&#10;An alternate game consists of two plays, with teams switching allegiance. The winning team is then the one that saves the most humans.&#10;&#10;From the same film series:&#10;&#10;    Jurassic Park Game&#10;    Jurassic Park III: Island Survival Game&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The player moves Jasper horizontally along the garden path while casting spells to either transform the approaching zombies into flowers or ignite those flowers and any nearby zombies with magical fire.

If you can survive both waves of Zot's undead army, you win the game and earn a score based on how well you did.&#10;&#10;Jasper and Zot won first place in the one full-sheet label game design contest here on BGG.

    "description": "Onami is a strategic card game that is simple to learn, but difficult to master!&#10;&#10;The concept is simple, both players draw 5 cards from a shuffled deck of 49 cards.&#10;&#10;Each card in their hand will have 4 numbers on it, one number on each facing of the card. North, East, South, and West&#10;&#10;The first player ( chosen randomly ) will then place a card some where on that 5 x 5 grid. Next they will place a double sided token on the card marking that they own it, with the color of their choosing facing up. They will then draw a card from the deck, signaling the end of their turn.&#10;&#10;The next player will then go, doing the same thing.&#10;&#10;Players may also rotate the card however they desire to get the optimal outcome.&#10;&#10;If a player lays a card next to a card they do not own they can potentially take ownership of it and possibly cards next to that one and so forth!&#10;&#10;Using the example below the second player, who is represented by the black token laid their card to the right of one of the first players cards, who is represented by the white token.&#10;&#10;The card they laid down has a 7 on the west face of the card. The card to the left of it has a 0 on the east face of the card. Since 7 is greater than 0 the player represented by the black token can gain control of that card,&#10;&#10;But wait it doesn't end there! There is also the possibility of chain reaction captures! Lets examine the sample below.&#10;&#10;The card with the black token on it was just laid down by the second player, the number facing west is 3, the number on the card beside it that is owned by the first player has a number of 1 on the east side. Since 3 is greater than 1 it captures it.&#10;&#10;But it doesn't end there! Since the difference between 3 and 1 is 2 the second player, represented by the black token card capture up to two cards total ( including the initial card captured ) if there are numbers on the next card that are greater than cards it is next too and that the second player doesn't already own. The ending result is as seen below.&#10;&#10;Using this mechanic, even if you are woefully behind a single card can potentially bring you back in to the game!&#10;&#10;There are many strategic ways to play Onami, but you must be careful to be both defensive and offensive&#10;&#10;",

Each player is dealt a hand of 4 cards from a standard deck, and then the Dealer deals four cards face-up to the center of the table.  If you're right-handed, you should keep your hand (of cards) in your left hand, and vice-versa -- this is because you are only allowed to use one hand to pick up or put down cards.&#10;&#10;When everyone is ready, the Dealer says &quot;Begin&quot;, at which point the round starts.  Play is simultaneous, with no turns.  Your goal is to have all four cards in your hand of the same value (i.e. all 4 kings, or all 4 deuces).  If a card you want is on the table, pick it up, put it in your hand, and then discard a card to replace it.  If the action comes to a standstill because noone wants any of the cards on the table, the Dealer removes them, deals another four cards, and says &quot;Begin&quot; again.&#10;&#10;When you have acquired a complete set, you have Kemps, but you cannot declare this yourself.  Instead, you must use a pre-arranged signal to inform your partner (which must be &quot;over the table&quot; -- no kicking your partner in the shins!), who then announces &quot;Kemps&quot;.  You show your hand, and your team gets a point.  If you or your partner misread the signal and call Kemps erroneously, the other team gets a point.  If you think you have spotted the other team's signal, you can call &quot;Kemps against&quot;, and name the player you think has Kemps.  If you are correct, your team gets a point, otherwise the other team does.  When someone has figured out the other team's signal, that team can go somewhere private to come up with a new one.&#10;&#10;Play until any agreed-upon number of points.&#10;&#10;",

Depending on what the dice has shown, players may expect different events: maybe the cats are hungry and they will move or hunt, or it rains in one sector of the island or even the industry is polluting more than usual.&#10;&#10;Then, in the second phase, the player must use their action points wisely to act upon what's happening on the island, they may need to protect the Tori-tori, but the rabbits are also in of need vegetation to eat or a fire is spreading widly near the industry.&#10;&#10;But not everything is so simple, at first players will have only basic actions to work with, but as the game progress and the players study and specialize they will learn new actions that will have an impact on preserving the life and health of the island ecosystem.&#10;&#10;To win the team must transform the town and the industry into an environmentally friendly alternative but if any native species goes extinct the game is over and the team lose.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Explore Dorian with your unique character that progresses during the game and leads your army into battle. Build your deck of Battle Cards based on your play style with either Stealth, Physical or Magic. Start Siege battles to capture locations or engage in Field battles to defeat your rival armies.&#10;&#10;During the game, there will be a lot of player interaction. Players will negotiate, fight tactical Siege and Field battles by using their Battle Cards and they might even betray each other. The player with the most Influencers Points (IP) wins the game. There are alternative victory conditions, like team battles and by capturing the capital.&#10;&#10;The duration of the game can be controlled by choosing the number of rounds (Kingdom Event cards) and by setting a goal on the Influence Point Track. Meaning you can play a short 1-hour game or play for six hours or more.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

A scoring card is shown, players select their Gaul cards and show them together, highest wins the Roman and discards their winning card. The other players return their cards to their hands to fight again. There are also Pirate cards which reduce your winnings and Dogmatix cards which allow the players to draw from the deck and either keep the card themselves or pass it onto another player. The rank of the Roman increases your score, but combinations of the same rank are worth much more.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    The Gnumies &#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "&quot;Altar of Freedom: Grand Tactical Battles in the American Civil War&quot; is a set of miniatures wargame rules for fighting the largest battles of the American Civil War in 6mm scale.&#10;&#10;This system is designed for real historical scenarios like Antietam or Chickamauga, not for points-driven tournament matches. Your role as a player will be to step into the boots of a corps or army general. Operating at the highest levels of command, you will not bother yourself with micromanaging regiments or interfering in the affairs of your colonels. Your challenge will be coordinating your divisions to be in the right place at the right time and wrestling with the out-sized personalities of your corps commanders. The rest, as Robert E. Lee might say, is in God's hands.&#10;&#10;Grand Tactical: The rules are designed for 6mm/10mm miniatures, with an available conversion to 15mm. One turn is approximately one hour,  1&quot; = 150+ yards, and 1 base = 1 brigade. Basing is flexible, so long as both armies are based in the same manner.&#10;&#10;Altar of Freedom is a turn-based game, although the duration of each turn is determined by a variable Turn Clock. At the start of each turn, players secretly bid Priority Points for the opportunity to maneuver their divisions before the enemy. After the secret bidding, players reveal their highest bids and begin maneuvering divisions in order of priority. After each new bid is reached, players roll to remove time from the Turn Clock. The Turn Clock is the strategic center-piece of the game, since players vie for control of the clock throughout the battle. He who controls the clock can manipulate the speed of the countdown. When the clock does expire, the turn ends immediately and players complete some minor adjustments before proceeding to the next turn. Because all games are based on historical scenarios, every battle has a defined end with victory conditions for each commander.&#10;&#10;",

Taking on the roles of Naruto, Sakura, Kakashi, Rock Lee, Sai and Shikamaru from the Hidden Leaf Village, players attempt to stop the Akatsuki from extracting the tailed beasts from their bearers and using them to power their ultimate weapon: The Ged&ocirc; Maz&ocirc;.&#10;&#10;In more detail, the Akatsuki start at one of the nine villages on the game board, spend at most three turns in that village, then (if they're not defeated there) move to the next village. Each Akatsuki character has its own strengths and weaknesses. The villages are distant from one another, so players can't race from one village to another after them, but must divide their forces to prepare for conflict, encountering unexpected events along the way.&#10;&#10;Each player has a character card showing Combat Ability, Chakra Reserve, and Strategy Value, as well as an experience track that allows them to power up over time. Each character also has a deck of fourteen ability cards, some common to each deck but most unique to that character.&#10;&#10;Each turn a character takes two actions from move, meditate, or fight. When you fight, you roll dice, hoping for shuriken. You can play cards to increase the number of dice you roll, but you must spend Chakra to play them and both cards and Chakra are limited. The enemy fights back if you don't deal enough damage to it, possibly triggering special powers and additional effects in the process.&#10;&#10;Once the Akatsuki arrive at Hidden Leaf Village, players must face Tobi and the Ged&ocirc; Maz&ocirc;, with their power being greater for each tailed beast that they stole on their way to this final showdown.&#10;&#10;Naruto Shippuden: The Board Game features three levels of play and a large variety of enemies, making each game a unique experience.&#10;&#10;",
