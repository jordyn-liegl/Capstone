It begins with Argentina in control of the Falkland Islands and UK forces approaching to try to retake them.&#10;&#10;Aircraft counters represent four aircraft of one particular type. Ground-unit counters represent infantry battalions (500 to 600 men), artillery battalions (12 to 18 guns with crews), armored reconnaissance squadrons (eight to 12 vehicles and their crews), a heavy machinegun company (120 men with heavy machineguns), and special forces teams (25 to 50 men). Ship and submarine counters each represent one vessel.&#10;&#10;Each turn represents between one to three days, depending on the current operational tempo. Each inch on the Tactical Area Map equals five miles. Each inch on the Strategic Sea Area Map equals 100 miles. The game uses an adaptation of the system originally created for our Red Dragon Rising game.&#10;&#10;Special rules cover such things as: Operation Black Buck, decisive leadership, Exocet missiles, stealth aircraft, reinforcements, off-map areas, naval transport, airbase limits, submarine operations, strategic airlift, rebasing, ship repair, special forces raids, the Total Exclusion Zone, aerial interception, cross-decking, naval surface actions, ground assault, heliborne movement, the Argentine mainland, protected targets, entrenchments, mountain combat, severe weather, and much more. The turn sequence is as follows.&#10;&#10;I. UK Operations Phase&#10;II. AR Operations Phase&#10;III. UK Submarine Phase&#10;IV. AR Submarine Phase&#10;V. Random Event Phase&#10;&#10;",

The structure of Kit &amp; Caboodle draws on the complexities of probability, set theory, the riddle of evolution, and the psychology of perception.&quot;&#10;&#10;Actually, it is a dice game very similar in gameplay to Yahtzee or Kismet. Players have six dice, and roll any or all dice one, two or three times attempting to obtain dice combinations fitting a scoring category. Players fill scoring boxes and add them for a total score. The player with the highest total score wins the game.&#10;&#10;Instead of number combinations, though, you are mixing and matching animals and their characteristics (plus a moon and and planet!). For each turn you must fill in a category on the scorepad. So there are decisions such as whether to use a bird for a Bird Caboodle, a Wings Kit, or a Shells Kit.&#10;&#10;Not all seventeen figures are on all the dice, as they are six-sided, so you must keep in mind that some rolls would not work, ever. Also figures aren't represented equally but are merely an assortment. For example, there are 4 birds, all green; there are 2 &quot;boo&quot; but only one of all the other purple letters, 3 moons, 2 green planets, and 2 pterosaurs (one of each color).&#10;&#10;",

You move your characters around the board from city to city, and you ultimately win the game by taking over cities. You as a gang boss get Notoriety Points by having your characters fight and hurt other players' characters. If you miss in a fight, you do Collateral Damage to the city (thus the name of the game). However, as is typical in romantic comedy anime, your characters might fall in love, usually unreciprocated, and will then ignore your orders to instead follow their love around the board.&#10;&#10;Each turn in the game has 9 phases, most of which are brief.&#10;1) Initiative - Figure out turn order, based on player strength.&#10;2) Libido - All characters gain Libido, which they can use to move and fight.&#10;3) Voluntary Movement - players move their characters, then 4) Automatic Movement - characters may be dragged towards a Love Interest or Rival.&#10;5) Love - Characters may fall in love based on the Looks and Gender of other characters in that city.&#10;6) Combat - Characters in cities fight, gaining Notoriety for the player.&#10;7) Domination - Players can try to use any characters still conscious to Dominate cities, spending Notoriety Points to better their chances.&#10;8) Firing &amp; Recruitment - Players can fire characters and recruit new characters, spending Notoriety Points to do so.&#10;9) Mutual Love - Characters in love with each other and alone together in a city lose all of their libido.

Units moving using the actual historical map features.&#10;&#10;In February 1864, US Brig. Gen. Judson Kilpatrick conceived a bold stroke against the Confederate capital, which local Union sympathizers had correctly reported as wide open to attack. The goals of the raid were to release the thousands of Union prisoners of war held in Libby Prison and on Belle Isle, as well as inflicting damage on key Rebel installations like the Tredegar Iron Works. Secret orders also authorized the killing of Confederate President Jefferson Davis and burning the city to the ground.&#10;&#10;Historically, at the last minute, Kilpatrick lost his nerve and withdrew without firing a shot. The game begins at that point, but with the assumption the Union commander's nerve holds. As the Union raiders enter the city, it's a race against time as they seek to commandeer transport for the sick, wreak destruction across Richmond as slaves and panicked civilians fill the streets, and escape before Confederate army reinforcements begin pouring in from all directions.&#10;&#10;",

It is now out-of-print.&#10;&#10;The game is played in three stages. In the first stage you have to take the map pieces from the other players.&#10;&#10;Second stage: When you have all the pieces, you know where the treasure is located (since you would know which part Captain Kidd has swallowed = missing) and you can rush away to the hidden place to get the treasure chest.&#10;&#10;In the third and last stage, you have to run away, either with the raft or with one of the rowing boats the player arrived with. All the time the other player can get the map pieces or the chest from you, so you need to be quick and careful.&#10;&#10;Of course the pirates may duel with pistols and shoot with the cannon - placed in the centre of the island - at each other!&#10;&#10;The game were sold with fine metal (tin) playing pieces: six pirates, a raft, a cannon and, of course, the treasure chest (fitted with a steel ring so it could be hung on the pirate playing piece representing who had custody of the treasure!).&#10;&#10;",

Besides they can play different special cards and also put the cards from their hands into a &ldquo;revolver&rdquo; area which limits their opportunities during the game but helps in the final duel. There are several sheriff cards inevitably causing the duel in which the card combinations that are put into the players&rsquo; revolvers are very important. As a result of the duel all the cards from the loot deck are shared as victory points among players. The game lasts for several rounds and the one who has got the most victory points becomes a winner.&#10;&#10;",

If a player does not have enough money, or does not want to spend the money they have, they must accept your offer. Once all players have had a chance to make offers, the round ends and all acquired items are added to their new owner's collection. Sometimes you will find it is just as rewarding to force other players to spend their money protecting items you didn't really want in the first place!&#10;&#10;Foreclosed! lasts thirty minutes and can be played by 2-6 players.&#10;&#10;For added depth and challenge to the game, Foreclosed! includes action cards for experienced players.&#10;&#10;&bull;&bull;&bull;&#10;&#10;Vasaran Alla  - peli ahneille neuvottelijoille.&#10;&#10;Hyvin suosittu ja rikas filmit&auml;hti on tehnyt yll&auml;tt&auml;en henkil&ouml;kohtaisen vararikon!

Each player is given the task of convincing someone else that certain crazy subjects &ndash; such as glitter monsters or magnetic hands - are better, worse, or just plain weirder than others. If you can successfully do this and earn the most points, you win and get to demand that all of your friends do everything you say for the next 24 hours&hellip; Ok, that&rsquo;s not really true. Turns out we can&rsquo;t force mind control on your opponents, but at least you win the game!&#10;&#10;Each game is different, because the players get to change the story every time they play depending on which transmog words are paired with each question. Jetpack Unicorn is easy enough for true beginners to pick up, but it&rsquo;ll keep even the most advanced storytellers entertained for hours on end!&#10;&#10;265 cards.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Best of British Game Rules&#10;A game for 2 teams of any number or 2-6 individual players.&#10;&#10;The Team Game is great when you have a mix of younger and older players. It makes best use of everybody's knowledge. The individual game is great if you want to be more competitive.&#10;&#10;CONTENTS:&#10;Best of British Playing Board&#10;400 Best of British Question Cards&#10;6 Playing pieces&#10;&#10;TEAM RULES&#10;PREPARING TO PLAY&#10;Unfold the board and lay it on the table. Each team selects a playing piece and places it on the Start Space on the board.&#10;&#10;Split the players into two teams. The oldest player in each team will become the first Question Master for their team. The team containing the youngest player will start.&#10;&#10;THE QUESTIONS&#10;There are four questions on the back of each card. The first question is beside the Red Square followed by the White, Blue and Green.&#10;&#10;There are three kinds of question cards:&#10;&#10;Picture cards - on which there is a picture that the questions relate to.&#10;&#10;Common Theme Cards - on which all the answers have a common theme.&#10;&#10;Pot Luck Cards - on which there are random Best of British questions.&#10;&#10;THE BOARD&#10;The board is a path from the outer Start space into the Winning Zone in the centre of the board. The spaces on the board are made up of the four different colours that match those on the Question Cards. The first four spaces on the board match the order of those on the cards.&#10;&#10;After the first four spaces the colour order becomes random so just answering one question correctly can sometimes mean a big leap forward.&#10;&#10;PLAY&#10;The Question Master for the team containing the youngest player picks up the first Question Card from the box making sure the answers are concealed from all the players on both teams.&#10;&#10;If it is a Picture Card, the picture is shown to all the players on both teams. If it is a Themed Card, the theme is read out to all the players on both teams.&#10;&#10;The Question Master reads out the Red Question to the opposing team. If that team answers correctly they move their piece onto the first Red Space on the board. The same team is then given the White Question, moving their piece onto the White Space if they answer correctly and so on down the card.&#10;&#10;If at anytime a question is answered incorrectly then the Question Master can put the same question to the members of their own team for a bonus move. If they answer correctly they move their own piece onto the next space on the board that matches the colour of the question. The original team is always given the first chance to answer each question. After the Green Question has been played the card is placed to the back of the card box.&#10;&#10;The Question Master for the other team now takes out the next card from the box and plays the card to their opponents in the same way.&#10;&#10;The two teams take alternate turns at being the Question Master and also alternate the roll of Question Master within their team.&#10;&#10;When any team answers a question correctly and there are no spaces left matching that colour left on the path, they move their piece directly into the Winning Zone.&#10;&#10;WINNING ZONE&#10;Once inside the Winning Zone a team no longer moves their piece after answering a question correctly. The first team to answer any bonus question correctly after having entered the Winning Zone wins.&#10;&#10;INDIVIDUAL PLAY&#10;The oldest player becomes Question Master for the first game and asks the first card to the player on their left. The bonus opportunity for any incorrect answer passes firstly to the next player to the left and so on. The order of play then continues in a clockwise direction.&#10;&#10;Source: Publisher's Website&#10;&#10;",

At least two major versions have been produced. A large sized version about 18x11 inches and smaller version about 8x6 inches. While the specific materials and details of design have varied over the years, the fundamental design has remained. It is a board which may be opened to insert a sheet with cards indices and suits printed on it. The covering board is closed and the hand is played by opening windows. The player decides on their own play and reveals the next window to see what the expert recommends. An accompanying booklet explains the expert's recommendation.&#10;&#10;The system can be used to teach the completely naive novice to highly advanced players. Many supplementary sheets were produced over the decades.&#10;&#10;Mainly a teaching aide, there is no scoring, per se.&#10;&#10;Experts who have contributed to the Autobridge system include: Ely and Josephine Culbertson, Charles Goren, Alfred Sheinwold, Alan Truscott, Barry Rigal, Albert Morehead, and Richard Frey.&#10;&#10;Most versions found in online auctions appear to date from the 1950s.&#10;&#10;",

As each piece is obtained, it is placed near the player's HQ on the inner part of the board. Once five pieces of equipment have been so placed, the mission can begin.&#10;&#10;The mission takes place on the inner part of the board. Here, each player has a home territory of 5x5 squares and these areas are separated from one another by a wall or fence. On his turn, the player rolls a special die and uses it to move his equipment pieces toward an enemy HQ. The barriers can be breached by moving a ladder or wire-cutter onto them, or alternatively the passport piece can be moved onto the central checkpoint square to allow other pieces to pass through here. Each type of equipment has a point value (gun = 6, dagger =5, etc). When two opposing pieces occupy the same square, the one with the lower value is removed (both are removed if they are of equal value). Players cannot continue missions with fewer than five pieces of equipment and are forced to return to the outer board to acquire replacements before continuing. If a player manages to land a piece onto an opposing diplomatic bag, it is captured and he can start to move both pieces back towards his own HQ as a single unit.&#10;&#10;While moving on both the inner and outer board, the player may have to draw a chance card of some sort, and this is where the game's chief gimmick comes into play and from where it takes its name. These cards all have the word 'Microdot' on them, written in dots. One of these dots contains a very small number or letter and the included plastic magnifying glass is supposed to be used to read it (but this is not really necessary). The letter/number is then referenced on the relevant 'decode' chart and the instructions followed.&#10;&#10;",

This is done by gathering toilet paper cards and laying them down when you have a full set that matches your butt character. There are plenty of action cards to steal, draw, or otherwise shift the game in your favor, and some that can be used to change the butt characters.

This mysterious installation, code named &ldquo;the Facility,&rdquo; uses unknown energies to morph and transform itself at will to keep horrid villains, dangerous creatures, alien entities, and top-secret research projects trapped within. Rumors of the Facility&rsquo;s existence and its most prized possessions have leaked, and the Valiant Universe&rsquo;s most powerful organizations&mdash;The Harbinger Foundation, the Renegades, GATE, and more&mdash;are taking an interest. The world may never be the same.&#10;&#10;In Valiant Universe: The Deck-Building Game you command an organization attempting to seize the secret Alcatraz base. Purchase cards to craft a unique deck, and battle your way through the ever-changing Facility grid that moves during play to gain access to a card or damage another player. Maneuver your superhero miniatures to battle it out with other superheroes for ultimate control!&#10;&#10;From the rules:&#10;&quot;Each player assumes the role of an&#10;Organization within the Valiant Universe,&#10;attempting to infiltrate the Facility and gain&#10;control while fighting off any other Organizations&#10;along the way.&#10;The Facility is abstractly represented by a grid&#10;of cards: 5 Levels (rows) x 5 Blocks (columns), for&#10;25 decks of cards. Each deck on this grid is known&#10;as a Sector.&#10;To gain ultimate control of the Facility, each&#10;player will play cards from their hands to deal&#10;damage to other Organizations and manipulate&#10;the cards in the grid&mdash;which represents the Facility&#10;morphing and changing. Players will also have the&#10;opportunity to purchase cards from their Zone of&#10;Influence (ZOI) on the Facility. Additionally, players&#10;can move their Superhero miniature around the&#10;Facility&rsquo;s Sectors to deal additional damage to&#10;Opponents, while making use of their Abilities on&#10;their Power card.&#10;Along the way, the Facility may also strike&#10;back at the players. As fighting rages throughout&#10;the underground complex, damage is also inflicted&#10;not just to Organizations but to the Facility as well,&#10;marked using the Facility Durability Tracker. As&#10;more damage is received, more Sectors&#10;go into shutdown, making those cards&#10;unavailable for purchase, as well as&#10;potentially causing damage to a player&rsquo;s&#10;Organization.&#10;As Organizations take damage, their&#10;Cohesion drops; a measure of their overall&#10;strength, morale, leadership, and ability to keep&#10;fighting. If an Organization&rsquo;s Cohesion ever drops&#10;to 0, they retreat from the Facility and are&#10;out of the game.&#10;The last player remaining in the game&#10;is the winner as they seize control of the&#10;Facility and its exotic treasures!&quot;&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "SUMMARY:&#10;The Fruit Ninja Card Game is based on the popular Fruit Ninja video game popularized on the iOS and Andriod mobile platforms.  In the video game, fruit (and bombs) are tossed into the air and the player makes gestures to slice as much fruit with their sword as possible while avoiding bombs.&#10;The Fruit Ninja Card Game is a very simple push your luck card game that makes thematic use of simply cutting the deck of cards.  By cutting the deck and selecting cards based on the risk associated with the color coded card backs, players attempt to be the first to either collect one of each of the 7 types of fruit or collect 25 pieces of the same type of fruit.&#10;&#10;GAMEPLAY:&#10;After shuffling the deck of cards, the starting player cuts the deck while making the sound of someone making a sword chop.  That player chooses either the top card from the bottom section of the deck or the bottom card from the top section of the deck (a choice between the two inner cards of the split deck). By looking at the color of the card backs, the player can asses the risk of choosing a particular card.  Some cards have a higher risk of being a bomb while having the potential to contain more pieces of fruit.  The player continues their turn as long as they avoid choosing a bomb card.  As long as the player only finds fruit cards, they continue adding up fruit and splitting the top section of the deck remaining from their previous split.  If the player chooses to stop, they get to keep their fruit cards and pass the deck to the next player.  If at some point the player chooses to cut the deck and chooses a bomb card, they end their turn and loose any fruit that they have revealed during that turn (while keeping fruit earned on previous turns).  Three types of power bananas can be played from a players saved stash of fruit to perform one of the following actions based on the type of fruit: steal a fruit, ignore a bomb or take an additional turn.  While very simple, this card game remains thematically true to the simple video game that it is based on.&#10;&#10;CONTENTS:&#10;103 Fruit Ninja Cards + 1 sheet of rules in English&#10;&#10;FROM THE BOX:&#10;Based on the hit game.  Make Sensei proud!  Cut the deck--select the top or the bottom.  The first player to collect one of each fruit or 25 of any fruit wins!  The colors on the card backs will help you choose.  Be wary! Bombs end your turn and you forfeit this turns bounty.  Power bananas grant special ninja powers.&#10;&#10;",

The name of the game is a portmanteau word from the German Schriftrollen (Scrolls) and Pflaumen (plums).&#10;&#10;The 77 scroll cards are shuffled and the top 11 removed from the game without looking at them.  Deal each player three scrolls and give each player seven plum tokens, which are both money for bidding and victory points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Each scroll is a rule of the game that must be followed when the scroll is played.  If a rule cannot be followed, the scroll is burned in the fire - that is, removed from the game.  Examples include, &quot;Each player must put three plums in the garden,&quot; if at least one player has fewer than three plums.  Or, &quot;The player with the most plums must give all other players a plum,&quot; if two or more players are tied for having the most plums.&#10;&#10;Players take turns reading the scrolls they wish, enacting the new laws, all of which involve plum distribution in some way.  You don't have to enact any of your scrolls unless you have more than five, at which point you MUST activate (or burn, if illegal) enough to bring your hand down to five cards.  A player then draws a scroll, reads it silently, and auctions it off without telling the others what's on it.  He may bid for it himself.&#10;&#10;The game ends when either all scrolls are taken or when the text of a read scroll requires the game to end.  The player with the most plums wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "The Walking Dead Card Game, based on Wolfgang Kramer's 6 nimmt!, features the same basic gameplay as that card game while adding six character cards and two modes of play: Survival and Hero.&#10;&#10;To play the game, you shuffle the 104 number cards, lay out four cards face-up to start the four rows, then deal a number of cards to each player. Each turn, players simultaneously choose and reveal a card from their hand, then add the cards to the rows, with cards being placed in ascending order based on their number; each card is placed in the row that ends with the highest number that's below the card's number. When the sixth card is placed in a row, the owner of that card claims the other five cards and the sixth card becomes the first card in a new row.&#10;&#10;In addition to a number from 1 to 104, each card has a zombie point value. In Survival mode (for 3-10 players), players want to collect as few points as possible, while in Hero mode (for 2-6 players) you want to collect more zombie points than anyone else. In Hero mode, each player has a single-use character card that can give you an extra advantage in the round in which you play it.&#10;&#10;",

Each player chooses which of her/his thieves to make active, knowing which thieves are in every player's den (and knowing that they know which cards s/he is choosing between).

Players bluff and back stab their way to victory, using the lower class thieves in the city -- including the Pickpocket, the Urchin, and the Woman of Easy Virtue. The game can be combined with Rival Den of Thieves for richer play. The game can accommodate 2-5 players -- up to 10 with a second deck or Rival Den of Thieves added.&#10;&#10;",

In today's world, a few big regional powers compete for world domination.&#10;&#10;In Defcon, internal frictions push decision-makers to look for international success to consolidate their power, even though it means conflict against international rivalries. In a climate of growing tension, megapowers begin an arms race to be prepared for a global scale conflict. Whoever controls the hegemonic megapower at the end of the fifth round wins, and to do this, that player must obtain the highest position on the consensus index, which is made up of two separate rankings: the reputation index and the military index. Those who will find the right balance between military strength and support from public opinion will win the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
