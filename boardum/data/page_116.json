It takes a lot of patience to sneak around and hunt bugs for food. No one truly appreciates the chameleon&rsquo;s plight!&#10;&#10;You are a chameleon just trying to make your way in this world, eating one bug at a time. Eat specific colors of bugs in the right order to win. Snatch tasty insects right out from under your opponents as you navigate the board fraught with dangerous snakes and other competitive chameleons.&#10;&#10;Players take turns moving around the board to collect bugs of their same color. Throughout the game players roll to add more bugs to the board. As chameleons, players can change their own color in order to eat new bugs and pass safely by snakes of the same hue. The game includes 21 colored chameleon meeples for this very purpose.&#10;&#10;As players start and complete objective cards they collect achievement cards which can help with additional actions or alternative ways to score. Whenever an objective is completed, the active player rolls a die and moves a progress marker along the game track. When the marker reaches the end, the game is over and all players tally their scores.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Assemble your clans mightiest ninja and compete for honor and glory in the annual ninja games.  The moonlight casts a pale light over the battleground as you compete with your team, earn experience, gain skills, and battle rival ninja clans in this league/campaign style game.&#10;&#10;Featuring world class Chibi style sculpts from the world famous Soda Pop Miniatures team (makers of Super Dungeon Explore), expect fun and whimsical game play to be married with fantastic and unique style and fun.&#10;&#10;Ninja All Stars allows for 2 to 4 players to take control of a team of ninja (this may be a pre-rolled team or a team purchased with points) and battle over objectives.  Each Ninja Clan is drawn from a different element (6 in total), with each element providing different bonuses in-game.  As well, the game's dice mechanic is based on the element system, using a rock-paper-scissors type of dice elimination to determine the outcome of various aspects such as combat, searching, and special abilities.  It is important to note that combat is not a simple &quot;I rolled more swords than your shields&quot;; the elimination of dice will give the winner a choice of different combat results based on the remaining dice.  The interesting point here is, ninja don't die in this game-rather,they are knocked out and placed in their team's dojo, where they rest and recover and may eventually be brought back onto the board.  The rules allow for one-off scenario games as well as league play with guidelines on ninja advancement, meaning that players can develop their ninja over many games.&#10;&#10;The game comes complete with enough miniatures to allow for 4 teams, each of a different element, the game board, and numerous tokens for game effects.&#10;&#10;",

The A-side of the unfinished album quickly became cult-followed by fans and critics around the world, turning into one of the most intriguing legends of rock-and-roll history. Fifty years later, the band has finally reunited to finish the B-side with the help of a team of the best musical producers in show biz. That's you!&#10;&#10;In HiFi, players start their turn by spinning the record's rondel on the turntable to choose an action within their reach, or they can spend production points to achieve one of the other actions. After resolving these actions, players allocate audio cards to the five studio tracks, earning points based on the buttons in that producer's equalization track and what's in the studio track. When a player allocates a guitarist card, each player who collaborated with the equalization of the guitar earns points. When elements such as sound wave or time-track positions match, players can perform bonus actions.&#10;&#10;Each round represents a song recorded on the A-side of the album that will help players gather information to aid B-side recordings. After listening to all of the songs on the A-side &mdash; 6-8 rounds depending on the player count &mdash; the game ends. Whoever contributed most effectively to the construction of the tracks on the album's B-side wins.&#10;&#10;",

The round ends when a player can no longer play a valid card from their hand. The player that could not play a card returns any Shards on their played cards back to the center, then takes card damage equal to the amount of Shards that are still on cards.

    "description": "The Conquerors is a projected series of games that will focus on history's great conquerors, those figures whose vision, greed for power, and remarkable military abilities have changed the map of the world, sometimes fleetingly, often permanently. The first game in this new series is Alexander the Great, a game that covers the career of the fabled King of Macedon, from his ascension to the throne until his army has &quot;Hellenized&quot; half the known world.&#10;&#10;The Conquerors: Alexander the Great uses an interesting new system that gives the players a feel for the era and the problems of campaigning therein. For one, there are no turns. Play keeps going until the Macedonian Player wins or Alexander dies. And winning, for the Macedonian Player, is no mean feat. Yes, his armies are mighty, but Alexander is a game in which the player must not just win battles, but also overcome the logistics of campaigning &hellip; building armies, getting them to where they're needed, understanding battle fatigue and weariness, dealing with personalities, and adapting to the society you are trying to seize.&#10;&#10;The player's goals, as Alexander, are multiple and difficult. To win, he must maintain his hegemony of Greece, become Great King and establish his Deity. The latter two require him to achieve eight separate, often difficult objectives, including controlling key provinces, building Alexandria, gaining control of the Royal Family, and invoking proskynesis (homage by prostration). A clever Persian player has many ways to stop the Macedonian from earning these, and the money and manpower to help him. Given Alexander's &quot;greatness,&quot; play testers found the game to be remarkably balanced.&#10;&#10;The Conquerors: Alexander the Great uses cards, but it is not a game &quot;driven&quot; by cards - this is not a Paths of Glory system game. Rather, it uses them to provide the players with the historical opportunities and outside events that shaped Alexander's campaigns. The cards cover such events as Alexander's drinking problems, the shadowy figure of Bagoas, the friendly presence of Black Cleitus, and possibilities of assassination, mass marriages, Spartan revolts &hellip; even a Honeymoon for the weary Macedonians!&#10;&#10;Combat uses a fun, two-tiered battle resolution system that accounts for many more factors than just numbers, and often leaves armies- even winning armies- in far worse shape than you may want.&#10;&#10;The Conquerors: Alexander the Great is a game rich in historical detail, a game that places major burdens on the players to achieve victory, and a game that's great fun! It can be played by two to four gamers in around 4 hours, and it can be played solitaire.&#10;&#10;TIME SCALE: 4 months per turn&#10;MAP SCALE: 150 miles per hex &#10;UNIT SCALE: Brigade, Division, Corps, and Army&#10;NUMBER OF PLAYERS: 1-2&#10;&#10;COMPONENTS:&#10;&#10;    140 half-inch counters &amp; 88 5/8-inch counters&#10;    55 Event cards&#10;    One 22&quot;x34&quot; Mapsheet&#10;    24-page Rule Book&#10;    2 Player Aid Cards&#10;    Three six-sided dice&#10;&#10;&#10;Designed by Richard Berg&#10;Developed by Bill Ramsay&#10;&#10;(from GMT webpage)&#10;&#10;",

The three colors in the game are black, white, and red, and each player will be a different color. Each tile has a background color and a different-colored circle in the middle. There are 6 different combinations and 5 small tiles and 1 large tile for each combination.&#10;&#10;Players place tiles on the table trying to connect groups of their border color and groups of their circle color.&#10;&#10;RULES&#10;&#10;Place all the tiles face-up in a pool, leaving room to play the game.&#10;&#10;Each player is assigned one of the three colors by some agreeable method and takes the corresponding counter; the counters just show which player is which color. The order of play is White player, then Black, then Red. Players take turns placing any tile from the pool on the playing surface according to the following rules:&#10;&#10;- Tiles must be placed so that they align with an imaginary grid of squares the size of the small tiles.&#10;&#10;- White cannot play a large tile on the first turn.&#10;&#10;- Except for the obvious exception of the first tile, each new tile must be orthogonally adjacent to at least one small tile (i.e. must touch a small tile). Just having the corners touch isn't good enough.&#10;&#10;- A large tile cannot be placed orthogonally adjacent to another large tile (that is, no two large tiles can touch each other, except at the corners).&#10;&#10;The game ends when there are no available moves.&#10;&#10;SCORING&#10;&#10;Small tiles count as 1 point, and large tiles count as 2 points.&#10;&#10;Find the largest connected group of tiles with your border color, and then find the largest connected group of tiles with your circle color.

Now they must defeat the curses before they're caught by the librarian, Professor Whispurr.&#10;&#10;Each turn plays quickly but offers interesting decisions, most often around which spell to use and how to use it. Spells allow kittens to draw extra cards, sling cards at other players, discard cards out of their own play areas, or trade any two cards in play. No player can use the same spell two turns in a row, either.&#10;&#10;The game ends when either the last of the six curses is defeated, or when the Professor Whispurr card is drawn from the ritual component deck. If the kittens defeated the last curse, then they tally up points (including a secret objective Extra Credit card), and the highest score wins. If they are caught by Professor Whispurr, then the Cleanest Paws Clause applies. All kittens with 10 or more points lose, and from those who are left, the kitten with the fewest cards in their play area wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "On 18 July 1936, various generals in the Spanish army rose up against the government of the Second Republic. The failure of the coup as it had been originally planned gave way to a civil conflict between the defenders of the democratic government and the backers of the military coup. Machado&rsquo;s two Spains fought each other for nearly three years in a battle which reflected the political and social tensions affecting the world at that time.&#10;&#10;The opposing armies were very different: on one hand, the Republican army possessed a limited number of professional soldiers and many popular militias belonging to political parties and labor unions. To this were added the International Brigades, formed from foreign volunteers of diverse origin; a fighting force which was highly motivated, but poorly coordinated and typically poorly organized. On the other hand, Franco&acute;s army had most of the professional military, along with Carlist and fascist militias, many native Moroccan troops, and the volunteers of the Condor Legion and the Corpo Trupe Voluntarie, sent by Hitler and Mussolini, respectively.&#10;&#10;From a military point of view, the Spanish Civil War presaged the global conflict which would soon erupt. In the mid-1930s, military high commands from all over the globe theorized on the possibilities of motorized armies and &ldquo;lightning war&rdquo;. Both Nazis and Soviets rehearsed armored tactics in Spain, and tested various types of weapons. In addition, the importance that air superiority would have on all later conflicts was made clear. All of these elements make the Spanish Civil War a fascinating conflict from an historical point of view and with regard to military strategy.&#10;&#10;A las Barricadas! (&quot;To the Barricades!&quot;), the first title in the War Storms series, is a game that attempts to simulate, at platoon and company level, the battles which took place on the different fronts of the war. The rules are oriented towards the tactical simulation of combat involving armored vehicles, infantry, artillery, and aircraft, and as such they are especially suited to represent almost any 20th century armed conflict as it actually occurred.&#10;&#10;",

The MARKET has 4 spots, in a row, each with one symbol.)&#10;     Give each player a SEA tile. The SEAs have one side where 4 land tiles can connect, each marked by a symbol, the same 4 symbols as at the MARKET board and matching in the same order. (The SEAs have 2 sides, use the side which matches the MARKET symbols order.)&#10;     Mix all land tiles (squares) and place a tile at each of the 4 spots at the MARKET board.&#10;&#10;&#10;TURNS:&#10;In your turns you place a land tile, adjacent to your SEA or adjacent to an already placed land tile, below 1 of the 4 symbols at your SEA tile (so in 1 of the 4 &ldquo;columns&rdquo; below your SEA).&#10;Then you take, from the MARKET, the tile from the same symbol (column), and you store that tile above your SEA. (!)&#10;In your next turn you connect that stored tile to your placed tiles, and again take the tile at the corresponding column (symbol) from the MARKET board which you store above your SEA again. And so on.&#10;&#10;WHAT'S SPECIAL:&#10;So after each turn you already know which tile you will place next turn, while other players have their turn first. Which makes the game go fast! Even though the puzzle to reach the best endscore is very deep!&#10;During other players' turns you will think about your own options with your tile. It avoids the feeling of waiting for your turn.&#10;Though you will look at other players' &ldquo;puzzle problems&rdquo; too. Alike in the *Factory Funner* game. :)&#10;&#10;ENDSCORE:&#10;&#10;     COMMON ANIMALS are at many of the land tiles, they score 1 victory point if their specific score rule is met.&#10;     RARE ANIMALS each are at only 1 land tile, they score 2 victory points if their unique score rule is met. (So you don't specialize on certain animals and don't ignore other animals. Each victory point is important, and during the game the puzzle to score all points gets harder and harder!)&#10;     For the landscape (Jungle / Savannah / Swamp / River Basin), you compare the player's expedition maps for the most victory points. For example, the player with the most separate Savannah areas gets the most Savannah points, while the player with the fewest separate Swamp areas gets the most Swamp points.&#10;     Dead end rivers (so rivers connected to land at another tile) in your expedition map bring 1 minus point each.&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "From Osprey's publicity:&#10;&#10;The Dark Age of Britain, from the middle of the 4th century to the end of the 8th, was a time of violence and warfare, when charismatic warlords such as the fabled King Arthur could gather together armies and carve out their own kingdoms. With this new set of wargames rules, players can take on the role of these warlords and command their own armies on the tabletop. Written by the author of the popular Glutter of Ravens rules set, Dux Bellorum is an element-based system, where each base of figures represents 50 fighting men. Each player has a specific number of points with which to construct his force and can choose to a Late Roman, Romano-British, Welsh, Saxon, Pictish, Irish, or Sea Raider army. The game is then played out following a set of simple, fast-paced rules. A completely self-contained gaming system, Dux Bellorum is perfect for gamers who are looking for a way into fighting Dark Age battles without investing a lot of time or money in larger rulesets.&#10;&#10;From the playtest introduction:&#10;&#10;Dux Bellorum is an Arthurian-era Dark Ages wargame, set in the period from the mid fourth century AD to the end of the eighth century AD. The rules emphasise the influence an army&rsquo;s commander has on his units, with simple manoeuvre rules and chaotic, swirling close combat. You'll win by inspiring the right troops at the right time, balancing quality versus quantity in your army, and by finding a sprinkling of luck at the right time.&#10;&#10;All distances are given in Base Widths, which allows the game to be used with any scale of miniature based in many different ways. An army usually has 6-12 units, and each unit is rated for Aggression (Attacks), Protection (Defence), and Cohesion (Strength) and is trained either as Shieldwall, Warriors, Riders, or Skirmishers (all of which operate differently in the game).&#10;&#10;Dux Bellorum armies are selected from following lists: Late Roman, Romano-British, Welsh, Saxon, Pictish, Irish, Land Raider, Sea Raider.&#10;&#10;",

You'll have to send your explorers in a nearby undiscovered temple to get the treasures stored inside. But watch  out!

Each turn, the players bet a certain number of explorers; the one who bets the most will have first pick on the treasure cards available. But selecting some cards can cause the temple to degrade further, reducing the value of certain types of treasures and forcing players to adapt their strategies on the go. After eight turns, the player who has the most points wins the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

You are repairing a piece of pottery, then playing the role of an art critic for your opponent. You can win by being a better artist, being a better critic, or both!

Try to make your color of pottery connect to make the fewest pieces.

Play 1 round per player, adding up scores from each round, and the lowest score wins.&#10;&#10;",

Pilots are represented by ratings which are embarked on the aircraft when launched.  The carriers move with a special die which gives each carrier a 50-50 chance of either moving forward one or turning 60 degrees.  The aircraft move with a normal d6.  If they manage to manoeuvre at torpedo run distance from an enemy carrier (6 hexes), drop their torpedoes.  These move inexorably one space per turn so the only defence is manoeuvring.  If the aircraft get within dogfight distance of each other (4 hexes), they may engage in a dogfight, which uses cards (a better pilot rating gives you extra cards) --it also forces the torpedoes to be dropped, so sacrifice dogfights are a viable tactic.  If you run out of torpedoes, you may kamikaze your aircraft.&#10;&#10;An amusing tactical simulation, very simple and fast-playing, with nice bits to boot.&#10;&#10;Remade in to Mission Command Sea.&#10;&#10;",

The map has been expanded to cover Central Asia and Mongolia. Additional units have been added to account for specialized formations, foreign interventionist and nationalist forces. Additional markers have been added to represent various special events not previously covered. The rules have also been clarified, and some modifications have been made.

Players then put in turn a card on the table, *trying* to put theirs in chronological order. A player may, instead of adding a card, claim that the order in which the cards were put is incorrect. In this case all cards are turned over and the correct years revealed.&#10;If the order was correct then the doubting player receives two cards and skips a turn. If the order was incorrect then the previous player, who accepted the order as correct, receives three cards. The first player that gets rid of all the cards wins.&#10;&#10;Bluffing is as least as important as knowledge in this game. Most events are rather obscure or are hard to date exactly, so this ain&rsquo;t no game for the nerds/geeks of this world, even they might think so, because it&rsquo;s full of surprises and pure fun. Highly recommended, because Anno Domini is a blast to play, is a very enjoyable social event and you even learn something from it.&#10;&#10;Unfortunately there is no English edition in existence, but this game could be a good way, to improve your already existing German skills or a very good reason, to learn German language in the first place.&#10;&#10;The set &quot;Wort Schrift Buch&quot; contains historical events which are related to writing and printing, and to the history of popular phrases.

    "description": "&quot;Maurice&quot; is a delightful combination of tabletop miniatures rules for historical and fictional battles, a limitless campaign system that requires virtually no math or paperwork, and a role-playing game in which the &ldquo;characters&rdquo; are officers, units, and armies, whose personalities you create, and whose fates you manage from battle to battle across wars and decades.&#10;&#10;The game play is driven by the action cards, which are used to activate forces and to modify those actions. Each card has the potential to do more than one thing, but can only ever be used for a single thing at any given time. The game is played in alternating rounds. The active player first chooses whether or not volleys will be fired by both sides. Then he decides whether to play a card for its event, or activate a group of units to march, rally, charge, or bombard. To activate a force a number of cards need to be discarded for their &quot;span&quot; number based on the distance from the commander to the force. The action also determines how many new cards may be drawn, the more vigorous action the fewer cards. Or he could also choose to pass and draw more cards. A group of units depends on their physical proximity, type, and formation. An additional card may be played to modify an action. The passive player might have interrupt cards that enable him to inject complications into the &#10;active player&rsquo;s action. The game continues until one side&rsquo;s army morale breaks. If neither side&rsquo;s army morale breaks before the game runs out of cards, then night has fallen without a decisive victory.&#10;&#10;",

Some people may hear the name and remember that the B-29s, the ones that dropped the atomic bombs on Japan, flew from there but for the rest it has become a minor part of military history - a forgotten battle.&#10;&#10;And yet Admiral Raymond A.

The game is an action packed, fast strategy experience. Brightly colored tanks move across a hexagon-tiled battlefield filled with three-dimensional scenery representing trees, barns etc. The colorful board and the cute animals with a twist of historical characters make the game accessible to kids and hilarious to adults. We used the same principle while creating the rules, they have an increasing complexity to ensure fun for both beginners and hardcore players.&#10;&#10;Armymals uses an intuitive system based on a set of unique dice and cards to generate a different choice of actions each turn. Animals in tanks are able to carry out many orders: moving, shooting, accumulating energy, using character skills, and more. To win, players have to collect victory points, which come from completing operations that are chosen at the beginning of the game and can be different each time. Depending on the active operations, players will have to destroy enemy tanks, capture the flag, control strategic locations, complete crazy tasks from mission deck, and more.&#10;&#10;",

Each suit has three performers, one each valued at 1, 2, and 3 points, which represent the featured, supporting, and lead actors respectively. The values 1, 4, and 7 of each suit have effects to manipulate the performers onstage and in line, which can change the current trump and scoring opportunities each hand.&#10;&#10;If at the end of the round, you are the only player with no performer tokens, you claim all the performers currently on stage as your score for the round. Keep one card between each round and put all used performers back in line behind the current line before starting the next hand in the new turn order.&#10;&#10;After playing an equal number of rounds per player, whoever has the high score wins.

    "description": "&quot;Fulda Gap: The First Battle of the Next War&quot;, is a regimental/brigade level wargame simulation of a possible Warsaw Pact assault into West Germany through the area of relatively open terrain centered around the town of Fulda sometime in the near future. Success would allow the Pact armies to drive a wedge between the NATO forces deployed to the north and south, seize several important logistic centers, and perhaps establish a bridgehead across the Rhine River.&#10;&#10;Of all the scenarios for a coming world war, none has received more attention than the possibility of a future NATO-Warsaw Pact confrontation. For 25 years, the armies of East and West have faced one another across a divided Germany, each knowing that it is in this region that the course of any war will be decided.&#10;&#10;There are two types of games: the Standard Game and the Advanced Game. Preferably, the Players should become familiar with the Standard Garne first and then increase the level of complexity until they find a rules mix with which they are most comfortable.&#10;&#10;The key to the game lies in the combination of a unique combat system and a new untried unit procedure. Basically, each ground combat unit consists of three &quot;steps&quot; and an untried status. As a unit enters combat, its actual strength&mdash; which may be greater or less than its normal face-value &mdash; must be determined. Combat results are expressed in terms of &quot;retreat points&quot; which must be expended either by retreating and/or by taking step losses. Since the owning player controls the path and method of retreat, there is a wide range of possible outcomes from each combat situation.&#10;&#10;Fulda Gap Shows the likely impact of a great number of factors on modern warfare. Supply and movement systems stress the importance of roads and autobahns; rules are provided to reflect the importance of divisional integrity, artillery, helicopters, airmobile units, replacements, Soviet doctrine, field fortifications, and disengagement. And players wishing to increase the complexity of the game may use an innovative air system. Extensive rules also cover chemical and nuclear warfare.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 1 day&#10;Hex: 3.88 miles / 6.25 kilometers&#10;Units: Regiment &amp; Brigade&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 22 x 34&quot; full color map&#10;One dual-side printed countersheet (400 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 16-page Fulda Gap rulebook&#10;One dual-side printed Turn Record/Reinforcement Track&#10;Two dual-side printed Charts &amp; Tables folder (4 pages, Combat, Terrain tables, etc)&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: High&#10;Complexity Level: Medium&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 4-15 hours&#10;&#10;",

One player shuffles her tiles face down and will be the caller for the game.&#10;&#10;The caller draws a tile, names the object on it (so that other players may locate the same tile), then each player places the tile on her own player board. A tile must be placed next to the midfield or to other tiles, and pipes must connect only to pipes of the appropriate width; exit pipes are considered to be both widths. Pipes can't connect to empty edges, and if you can't lay a tile (or don't want to), you can place it on the board face-down with the spiral back showing.&#10;&#10;After 24 tiles have been placed, players score points: 1 point for each spiral tile showing, and 1-3 points for each exit pipe not connected to the grid. The player with the fewest points wins!&#10;&#10;",

Sitting squarely astride ancient trade routes and with the added impetus of the world's addiction to oil, the area has been a hot spot for centuries. Now, with the old regime teetering and losing its grip, Iran makes a bid for forcing the West to recognize its complete sovereignty and control over its own affairs by striking at the one thing they care about: the flow of oil. Mining the Straits of Hormuz and declaring it closed to all traffic, Iran defies the world. The US, and perhaps some of its allies, takes action to re-open the straits and get the black gold flowing to the world again.&#10;&#10;Next War: Iran is the sixth game in the Next War series. It is unique in the series in that the Allied player has to do the attacking while the non-Allied player attempts to defend its territory against neo-imperial oppression. With a long logistical tail, few true allies in the region, and the menace of Iran's A2AD capabilities, re-opening the Straits is a tall order.&#10; &mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Second, no row can consist of more than five numbers. Finally, if a player places all five of their tiles in a single turn, they must be able to score in at least two directions. Once all the tiles have been placed, players are docked points for any tiles they have not used; highest score wins.&#10;&#10;The red &quot;Multiles&quot; were introduced in the 1968 edition; the previous (1964) edition didn't have those, and is played as if the &quot;5&quot; Multile were always the one drawn.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Legend has it that a long time ago, mankind was ignorant to the extent of not knowing how to count or tell the years apart. The ever-benevolent Jade Emperor wanted to help mankind out. From there, the idea of a twelve-year cycle and the naming of each year in the cycle after an animal was born.&#10;&#10;But how should the Jade Emperor choose twelve animals from among so many animals in the living world, while remaining impartial? To resolve this equitably, the Jade Emperor decided to hold a race involving all animals on his birthday. The first twelve animals to cross the river and reach the Heavenly Palace will have a year named after them, in the order of how they finished the race. The race became known as The Great Race and the twelve-year cycle was named the Chinese Zodiac.&#10;&#10;Race for the Chinese Zodiac is a board game that recreates The Great Race. Each player has a hand of eight action cards (numbered 1-8) as well as energy cards of different values and karma tokens. Each player selects one animal token and takes the corresponding animal card, which grants the player advantages during the race. All players place their animal token on the start space of the racetrack. Players assemble the dual-layered and double-sided action wheel that's used to determine the effectiveness of each action and place it in the center of the table.&#10;&#10;On a turn, all players select an action card and an energy card from their hand, then they reveal these cards simultaneously. If the action card selected is one value lower than the player's previously played action card, the player must spend one karma token; if two or more values lower, they must spend two karma tokens. Players then resolve all played actions based on the orientation of the wheel, ideally gaining movement, new energy cards, and karma. Everyone places their played cards face up in front of themselves, then rotate the wheel clockwise by one space and start a new turn.&#10;&#10;The first animal to complete the race earns the coveted right of having the first year of the Chinese Zodiac named after it!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

You thought that you'd never lose the game with such a skill, but it seems that all the players can predict the future likewise. Will you manage to make your prediction come true and win the future?&#10;&#10;Overview&#10;The players, using the cards dealt to them as their hands, play 7 to 10 units of mini-games, called tricks. Before starting the game, predict how many times you will come 1st, 2nd, and other places. The first player to make their prediction come true will score points.&#10;&#10;More Detailed Overview&#10;While in many betting trick-taking games, the players announce how many tricks they will win, in Seven Prophecies, the players must announce how many times they will come 1st, 2nd, and other places, like coming 1st twice, 2nd once, 3rd once, and 4th three times.&#10;&#10;Does it sound too difficult? Not at all!&#10;Because you &quot;know the future!&quot;&#10;Before you start the game, you know the lead suits of all the tricks (what color cards to be played), so compare them with your hand and announce with which cards you're likely to win.&#10;&#10;However, note that other players can also predict the future and thus have acquired the same information. Try to also read other players' thoughts and predict which places you will come.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "&quot;Julian&quot;, designed by Joseph Miranda, is a wargame of intermediate complexity simulating the situation across the Roman Empire in the 4th century AD. There are two opposing players: Roman and Barbarian. The Roman player represents the high command of a centralized empire; the Barbarian player represents the various chaotic forces working to destroy that empire. The Roman objective is to reconsolidate the threatened empire and secure its frontier regions to prevent further barbarian invasion. The Barbarian objective is to grab as much Roman territory as possible. The game system is based on the one originally presented in our earlier S&amp;T games: Series: They Died With Their Boots On (Decision Games).&#10;&#10;The Barbarian side is divided into &ldquo;forces,&rdquo; each representing an independent people or coalition of tribes, such as the Goths. The Persians and Armenians, though commanded in the game by the barbarian player, are considered &ldquo;civilized&rdquo; forces (along with all Roman and rebel units).&#10;&#10;Each turn represents one year. Each hexagon on the map represents 100 miles (162 km) from side to opposite side. Each unit represents 10,000 to 30,000 troops and camp followers, etc. Special rules cover such things as: usurpation, stratagems, random events, reinforcements, pursuit, taxation, Caesar and Augustus units, naval movement, fortresses and bases, fog of war, the Huns, political crises, tribal homelands, militia, field armies, supply trains, pursuit combat, amphibious operations, pillage, civic works, and more.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Jackson at the Crossroads is a simulation of the two battles of Cross Keys and Port Republic, fought respectively on the 8th and 9th of June, 1862.  Pursued by two Union forces, Jackson decided to stand and fight before his opponents could effect a junction.  At Cross Keys, he easily repulsed General Fremont's half-hearted attack.  At Port Republic, after some of the bitterest fighting in Jackson's experience, he managed to rout General Shield's lead brigades.  These two battles sealed the fate of the Union campaign to subdue the Shenandoah Valley that year, and allowed Jackson to leave the Valley altogether and join Lee in the defense of Richmond.&#10;&#10;Each hex on the mapboard represents 210 yards of real terrain from side to side.  Each Game-Turn represents 45 minutes during the day or 6 hours during the night.  The units are infantry and cavalry regiments, and sections of artillery.  Each Strength Point represents 100 men or one cannon.&#10;&#10;Jackson at the Crossroads is Volume 5 from the Great Battles of the American Civil War series.  Each game in the series uses a set of standard rules, which cover melee attack, small-arms and artillery fire, cavalry charges, and the effects of leadership.  Each game has a 16-page booklet of exclusive rules to cover the unique features of each battle and an historical article about each event.  The game includes 400 counters and one 22&quot; x 34&quot; map.&#10;&#10;Published with The Battle of Corinth: Standoff at the Tennessee, October 3-4, 1862.&#10;&#10;",

Years of pollution have tarnished the landscape, and the world's supplies of natural resources have dwindled to abysmal levels.The use of electric vehicles, solar technologies, and other energy-saving solutions have slowed the problem, but the long-term abuse on the planet by previous generations has been hard to reverse. Most Earthlings seem to have given up hope, yet a group of optimistic explorers are trekking to Mars, which some believe may turn around their fate.&#10;&#10;In search of knowledge, these explorers hope that understanding the demise of alien populations can assist them with preventing or at least slowing the rapid deterioration of Earth. They'll need to replicate Martian technologies, translate their languages, and avoid gaining too much radiation along the way in order to end up with the most prestige and save Earth as they know it.&#10;&#10;In Ruins of Mars, players compete to build out their arsenal of knowledge, attempting to understand the languages of ancient civilizations that colonized Mars and made it a hub of economic activity. The game is played around a board with five locations and eleven communal action tiles that are laid out at random underneath the board as evenly as possible.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you choose one of the locations, optionally pay to shift an action tile from an adjacent location to the active one, take the action of the location &mdash; the effect of which will be based on the tiles below that space &mdash; optionally replicate alien tech by paying resources and adding it to your board for personal use, then reallocate the action tiles from the active site in a mancala-like fashion.&#10;&#10;Over the course of the game, you learn the Martian languages and re-discover and study their technologies, which come in three levels and multiple classifications and which grant you special abilities. Along the way, you might pick up radiation from various actions, and you'll want to ditch that if possible so as not to lose points in the final scoring, which is mostly based on the tech you've assembled and your skill with languages.&#10;&#10;",

In a fragile monarchy, each member of the court will scheme to achieve as much influence on the coming succession as possible. And if victory seems impossible, it might be time to plan your revenge.&#10;&#10;There are seven unique characters in the game, each with its own special abilities and victory conditions. The King can be played by a Game Master but this is not mandatory, though reccomended. More players can act the roles of minor character, roleplaying the effects of the various cards being played. The seven unique characters are:&#10;&#10;    Ambassador&#10;    Archbishop&#10;    Baron&#10;    Queen&#10;    Royal Bastard&#10;    Steward&#10;    Treasurer&#10;&#10;&#10;Long Live the King is a live-action strategy game that blends diplomacy and backstabbing with strategic control of cards and limited ressources. During the game, each player will receive money and intrique cards and use these to increase their favor with the king, make alliances with other player or further their own goals. But as each player has a unique victory condition, alliances never lasts long in the court of the king. There are three distinct phases in the game, in the Audience phase ressources are distributed, in the Diplomacy phase off-table diplomacy occurs and finally the Council Phase is where players will make and discuss petitions. There is also a heavy emphasis on roleplaying, and each card and ability is recommended to be acted out by the players, as the King can grant Favor to those who perform particularly dramatic or cunning.&#10;&#10;Game Components:&#10;&#10;    31-page Rulebook&#10;    Seven Player Portfolios&#10;    Royal Bag of Coin&#10;    Coins of the Realm&#10;    200 cards divided into six different types&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Card Football is a playing card-based board game which follows the basic rules of American football. Players battle to win the down by playing the strongest hand.&#10;&#10;Game play combines elements of classic playing card games to simulate the action on the field. Players must decide how best to play their cards. For instance, cards can be played individually, in pairs, two pair, three-of-a-kind, or five-card poker-style 'Power Hands'. Much like a football coach deciding what play to call, or the quarterback choosing his best option, players must decide whether to play strong card(s) immediately, or to hold back in hopes of using it to put together a stronger hand.&#10;&#10;Other elements of Card Football include team and player chips, game board, a score board, a referee/yard marker and dice that are used for fumble, field goal and injury situations.&#10;&#10;Card Football allows for one, two, three and four-player modes. The single-player game mode is set up so that an individual can take on 'the system' and pick up the basics of the game before challenging friends in an all-out gridiron battle. In addition, the learning curve with Card Football is remarkably low. Typically, the game is learned in two to five minutes, or after a few series of downs.&#10;&#10;If it happens on the field, you'll find it in Card Football. From field goals, punts and extra points, to fumbles, interceptions and last-second heroics, you get it all in four quarters of Card Football action.&#10;&#10;",
