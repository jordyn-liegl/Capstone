    "description": "Southern Russia, early February 1943 -- In Stalingrad, the surrounded remnants of the once might German Sixth Army are being slowly and methodically exterminated. Hundreds of miles to the west, two powerful Soviet Fronts are moving west and south against a patchwork German line, intent on destroying the remaining Axis forces in Southern Russia. Operations Star and Gallop have begun.&#10;&#10;Six weeks later, the shocked, battered remnants of these two Soviet Fronts are running for the collective lives from powerful German panzer spearheads. What had happened? Soviet overconfidence was responsible in part for the disaster, playing into German hands, but by far, most of the credit for the amazing reversal belonged to Field Marshal von Manstein. Holding off the Soviets to his front and Hitler at his back, he managed to accumulate sufficient panzer formations to allow the Germans to regain tactical and operational superiority.&#10;&#10;Von Manstein's Backhand Blow is a low/intermediate complexity two player game using the well-received Turning the Tables system pioneered in earlier east front games produced by Moments in History. The game system itself is easy to learn and master. No two games will ever play out alike because a great deal of uncertainty and randomness is injected into each combat due to the Combat Chit Draw and Random Events Table. This uncertainty makes Von Manstein's Backhand Blow ideal as a solitaire game since combat results cannot be accurately predicted.&#10;&#10;Dirk Blennemann, the designer, has the reputation for creating excellent Orders of Battle for East Front simulations. Using detailed Russian and German language sources, he provides a broad array of maneuver units - Soviet division and corps on one side, and German units ranging from regiments down to the multitude of ad hoc German kampfgruppen thrown into the battle to stop the Soviet advance.&#10;&#10;Game Features:&#10;TIME SCALE     2 days per turn&#10;MAP SCALE     8km per hex&#10;UNIT SCALE     Soviet corps and divisions; German regiments, kampgruppen, and battalion-sized&#10;NUMBER OF PLAYERS     One or two&#10;&#10;(from GMT website)&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "The year is 1870.&#10;The World is at War.&#10;&#10;The world of Dystopian Wars is similar to our own but subtly different. The year is 1870 and the Industrial Revolution occurred decades earlier than in our own world. Technology is far advanced, and in many cases, unrecognisable, which has led to the development of fantastic naval vessels, hulking land ships and terror from the skies in the form of airships and war balloons.&#10;&#10;Dystopian Wars is designed to ensure a fun game with a large selection of models in a couple of hours. We are big fans of Steam Punk and Victoriana, so we jumped at the chance of creating a naval warfare game along similar lines to our Uncharted Seas and Firestorm Armada games - but encapsulating these interesting genres. Dystopian Wars incorporates Naval, Aerial and Land Models from the outset so that you can set up battles and scenarios in any combat setting. Games can be played in each genre of warfare OR using a combination of ALL models.&#10;&#10;Warcradle Studios will supply highly detailed, high-quality miniatures with which you can roam the high seas, scour the smog-filled skies of Dystopian Wars for enemy flying ships, or doggedly defend the cities and countryside of your home nation. These three branches of the military use the same core rules for movement and combat, with varying abilities and statistics.&#10;&#10;Our fast play rules are optimised for large fleet actions, so you can get as many miniatures on the table as you want, and still get an enjoyable game in one evening. Dystopian Wars is also ideal for multiplayer games because you get to activate individual squadrons of miniatures from one player to the next. The rules allow for the use of a deck of 52 Game Cards that add an exciting element of randomness to each game. You can play without them, but they improve the overall gameplay and inject some additional eccentric Victorian atmosphere.&#10;&#10;Dystopian Wars is our third game to be built using our D6-based core rules engine and shares elements with the science fiction space combat of Firestorm Armada and the fantasy naval combat of the Uncharted Seas. Dystopian Wars builds on the same successful game ethos.&#10;&#10;We are excited about the development of Dystopian Wars - it is an entertaining and violent game, putting you in command of huge Land Vessels, Giant Robots, Impressive Airships and Rugged Naval Ships. Your strategies and choices of fleet construction determine the margin of your victories or defeat. Whether you choose to focus on land, sea or in the air, you have every choice available to you to outmanoeuvre, harass and destroy your opponent.&#10;&#10;You command one of the great imperial powers of Dystopian Wars, you can defend your territories from foreign incursion, or you can conquer the world. The choice is yours.&#10;&#10;",

Some seek power, some seek revenge, while still others seek the great moment in battle that will define their place in history.&#10;&#10;Agamemnon is a fast-paced strategy board game in which two players take on the roles of ancient Greek gods during the Trojan War. By tactically deploying warriors to where they're needed across the board, each player may influence the final outcome of the battles famously detailed in Homer's Iliad. Some areas will be decided by the strength of the warriors, others by sheer weight of numbers, and some by the inspiration your heroes provide.&#10;&#10;To begin the game, Strings of Fate tiles are placed on their matching spaces on the board, and each player receives one set of fifteen playing tiles. These tiles come in three varieties: Warriors, with a numerical value marking their strength, Leaders, with both a letter rank and a strength value, and Weavers who have no strength or rank, but instead manipulate the Strings of Fate. Each player will shuffle their tiles face down in front of them.&#10;&#10;The first player flips over one of their tiles, and places it on any available space. If it&rsquo;s a Weaver, its effect immediately comes into play: the Warp Weaver may swap two adjacent Strings of Fate, whilst the Weft Weaver simply splits all strings it&rsquo;s connected to. After the first turn, each player flips and plays two tiles on their turns.&#10;&#10;Once all the tiles have been placed, each string is resolved: each Strength String is won by the player with the highest combined strength contained within it; each Leadership String is won by the player with the single highest ranked tile within the string; and Force Strings are won by the player with the most tiles, including Weavers, in the string. Players claim all the tiles from Strings of Fate they have won, and the player with the most tiles at the end wins.&#10;&emsp;&#10;&#10;",

To set up, choose one of three ready-to-play themed building sets, or put together a set of your own. Each set consists of five building cards, with associated building tiles for each card.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with one square land tile in play. Each land tile is divided into a 2x2 grid, with one of five types of terrain in each grid space; a space might also hold a gear icon or one of four types of relics. Players also have three land tiles in hand, and five land tiles are displayed face up.&#10;&#10;On a turn, choose a land tile from your hand or the display, then add it to your community, which can be at most four tiles on each side. When the tile has a gear, you can either place an inhabitant from the reserve on this gear or place a building tile in your community...but each part of the building must be supported by a gear and all of these gears must be on the same type of terrain.&#10;&#10;After you have a building in play, you gain the power of the building card and can use it once on each of your subsequent turns. Maybe you can place relic tokens for additional points, place additional inhabitants, junk an opponent's relics, or score for building large sections of a terrain or having more of a building than anyone else.&#10;&#10;Once everyone has sixteen tiles in their community, players score for what they've built, earning points for blocks of terrain of at least seven spaces, surrounded energy sources (which are a special type of tile), inhabitants, relics, and buildings.&#10;&#10;",

Your goal in Kharnage is to take control of something strategically essential, astoundingly beautiful, and envy of all other nations: a hill. Yes, just a hill. Admittedly, it is a nice hill. It may have a very commanding view of the surroundings, or it may not. You won't know until you get up there! To do so, you're going to have to drive off the armies of the other players by simply causing as much mayhem and bloodshed as possible.&#10;&#10;Each turn, you choose one battle card. The player with the lowest initiative value begins and:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Deploys new units and applies skills if needed, or&#10;     Attacks (shoot or assault) one opponent with all points, or two opponents by dividing their points.&#10;&#10;&#10;The next player then begins their turn, doing the same. After all players have taken their turn, the player who destroyed the largest number of units wins 5 domination points, the second 3 domination points, and the third 1 domination point. The last one has only their eyes for crying.&#10;&#10;Each time a player totally destroys an opponent army, they must yell &quot;KHARNAGE!&quot;, loud and clear, and stomp the table.

    "description": "We Are Coming, Nineveh! is a tactical/operational-level game of the Iraqi government campaign to liberate the western area of the city of Mosul from the forces of Daesh between 19 February and 9 July 2017. This was one of the largest and most difficult urban operations of the post-WWII era, and marked a major defeat for Daesh and its so-called &ldquo;Islamic State.&rdquo; The game is thus able to combine low complexity (and hence be accessible to even neophyte wargamers) with a rich and detailed treatment of this important battle.&#10;&#10;Unlike most wargames where there is a single measure for victory or loss, We Are Coming, Nineveh assesses three key aspects of the campaign: the speed at which the operation is completed, the casualties suffered by Iraqi government forces, and the collateral damage done to Mosul. One might outperform the historical case, capturing the Old City faster&mdash;but at a terrible civilian cost.&#10;&#10;Winner of the Charles S.

    "description": "Welcome to the experiential table top game that is going to redefine what it means to play a game. Nyctophobia, which means &quot;fear of the dark&quot;, is a cooperative game of survival in which up to four players must work together to escape a maniacal predator chasing them in a pitch-black forest. But there's a wrinkle: Would-be survivors play the game with blackout glasses. Players cannot see the board and have to rely on touch to navigate their way to safety. So, are you afraid of the dark?&#10;&#10;In more detail, Nyctophobia is a cooperative tactile maze game for 3 to 5 players. All but one of the players play the game completely unable to see the board. The blinded players make up the Hunted team. They are tasked with finding the car space on the board and surviving until the police arrive to rescue them. The sighted player is the Hunter, who is tasked with chasing down the Hunted and reducing one of the Hunted to zero health before the police arrive.&#10;&#10;Nyctophobia includes two versions of the Hunter that you can use: the axe murderer and the mage. The axe murderer is stalking you and your friends in the forest, plodding forward without care or thought, chopping down the trees that separate you to get to you all the quicker; this is the most basic and carnal of all of the experiences you can encounter in Nyctophobia. The mage, by contrast, is a trickster. It's not enough for the mage to hunt her victims. Messing with their mind, manipulating the forest around them, and leaving the blind opponents more lost than when she found them is her aim. The mage can rotate the map, move trees around the forest, and generally confuse the players.&#10;&#10;",

The player controlling that city can see all the cubes that must be delivered but can pull goods only from the right or left end of the row when loading them on the trains.&#10;&#10;Once the clock starts, all players take their actions simultaneously, in any order, and repeating any action as often as necessary. To transport cargo, a cube must first be loaded onto a short or long train piece that is at rest in the player's home city train yard. No train can move without a crew peg, and no crew peg may travel beyond the adjacent city. In order to transport cargo to more distant cities, a train needs to stop and have the crew peg swapped or cargo exchanged between trains. While all this is going on, players must avoid dropping or spilling cubes when picking up or handing the train to another player. Additional terrain components such as tunnels and bridges can be placed between cities and act as additional obstacles to negotiate. When time runs out, calculate the score by multiplying the TWO LOWEST counts of cubes delivered to a city. Points are subtracted for dropped cubes, or cubes delivered to the wrong city and also for crew pegs that traveled beyond their adjacent cities.&#10;&#10;With six players, each takes one of the six main cities, each producing goods which are delivered to the other five locations. In some scenarios with fewer players, each player may control multiple cities.&#10;&#10;",

When a virus attacks a tulip, the resulting colour patterns can be stunning, but the same virus weakens the tulip and makes reproduction a challenge. These rare tulips have always been quite expensive, even to this day. Many associate Tulipmania with these rare, high-priced tulips, but scholars report that this first bubble market, where buyers pay far more than something is physically worth because of the resale value, actually stemmed from the common tulip market over December 1636 and January 1637.&#10;&#10;The Dutch, well-known for their trading prowess, were the centre of the tulip trade. During this time, the bubonic plague was killing off 1 out of every 7 people per year, so the common man saw little reason not to invest foolishly with a chance of making a substantial profit. These conditions created a situation where the prices of tulips skyrocketed by the day, until the prices hit a point that could not be sustained. The wily investors knew when to sell off, so those who profited most are those who sold just as the market started to turn sour.&#10;&#10;You are playing one of those wily investors. You have a network of buyers and colleagues, all of whom are also trying to become wealthy. Your goal is to make smart investments, artificially raise prices, fleece your network at the best time, and then make your escape from Tulipmania with the most money.&#10;&#10;Online Play&#10;&#10;&#10;    JKLM Online (Real-Time and Turn-Based)&#10;&#10;&#10;",

One player plays the Germans and their allies (the Axis) and the other plays the Soviets. While paper and cardboard cannot possibly simulate a large-scale war, this game does attempt to model some of the significant aspects of the conflict, and also give the players an idea of the problems their historical counterparts faced.&#10;&#10;Masahiro Yamazaki has long been considered the East Front specialist in Japan. His games - including the excellent Stalingrad Pocket by the Gamers - have been enjoyed by English gamers since 1992. Now, for the first time, MMP is very proud to present his ultimate vision of the War in Russia. With over 10 years of development and expertise, Masahiro has culled all of his talents to give you the finest game on the entire Eastern Front of World War Two.&#10;&#10;Red Star Rising is part of the International Games Series (IGS) from Multi-Man Publishing (MMP). Using a variant of the popular Victory in the West chit pull system, but with some very novel twists, Masahiro presents the theater as never before. If the Soviet player can weather the Nazi storm, she will rise from the ashes and become the powerful enemy that defeated Germany. You will see the tables turn as in no wargame before.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Turn: 2 weeks to 2 months&#10;Hex: 22 miles / 35 kilometers&#10;Units: Corps/Division for the Germans; Corps/Army for the Soviets&#10;&#10;Game Details:&#10;Solitaire Playability: High&#10;Complexity Level: Medium&#10;Players: 1 or more&#10;Playing Time: 3-30 hours&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Panzers Last Stand is a Battalion Combat Series game depicting the Axis relief operations of Budapest from January to March 1945 in what became Germany's last major offensives in the war. The campaign game covers the Konrad Operations (I, II, and III) in January 1945. There are scenarios for each of the Konrad Operations as well as Operation Southwind in February and Operation Spring Awakening in March 1945.&#10;&#10;In the final months of the war, Germany was still full of fight and believed Budapest to be the key to turning the tide. With Budapest fully surrounded by Soviet and former-Axis Romanian forces, the situation in the city was desperate. The Germans devised a plan to relieve Budapest by bringing in the SS-Totenkopf and SS-Wiking Panzer Divisions from Poland to launch a surprise attack before the Soviets closed the ring on the trapped forces in the city. Launched in the wee hours on New Year's Day, 1945, the fate of the Axis hung in the balance. The Soviets, having campaigned continuously from the summer of 1944, fought back viciously and showed their mettle against the elite SS Panzer Divisions.&#10;&#10;A great proportion of the armored forces for both sides funneled into the Budapest area. All but one of the seven SS Panzer Divisions and half of the Heer Panzer Divisions on the Eastern Front (a full third of all Panzer Divisions total) ultimately fought here. The Soviets committed three Tank, five Mechanized, and one Cavalry Corps to blunt the Axis drive. The battlefield became a graveyard of tanks.&#10;&#10;The game showcases late-war equipment like the Tiger II, Brummba&#204;&#136;r, IS-2, and ISU-152 while also including unique units like Cavalry, Assault Pioneers, Soviet Naval Infantry, Hungarian SS, and ad hoc forces mobilized to defend Budapest. Rules covering Danube River crossing, Urban combat, redeployment deception (Maskirovka), and Festung rules highlight this unique and often misunderstood campaign.&#10;&#10;Scenarios:&#10;&#10;            The Taking of Budapest 123: Full Campaign (4 maps, 26 turns)&#10;            Operation Konrad I &amp; II (2 maps without Budapest, 10 turns)&#10;            Operation Konrad I (2 maps without Budapest, 5 turns)&#10;            Operation Konrad II (1 map without Budapest, 5 turns)&#10;            Battle for Zamoly (Part of 1 map, 5 turns)&#10;            Operation Konrad III (2 maps, 10 turns)&#10;            Battle for Koma&#204;&#129;rom (Part of 2 maps, 17 turns)&#10;            Days of Battle: Opening Blows to Koma&#204;&#129;rom (Part of 2 maps, 4 turns)&#10;            Operation Southwind (Part of 2 maps, 8 turns)&#10;            Operation Spring Awakening (2 maps, 10 turns)&#10;&#10;&#10; &#10;Components:&#10;&#10;            BCS rulebook (v2.0, in full color)&#10;            Two BCS Charts and Tables (v2.0, in full color)&#10;            BCS Support rulebook (v2.0, in full color)&#10;            PLS Game Specific rulebook&#10;            Axis Player Booklet&#10;            Soviet Player Booklet&#10;            Turn Record Track Card&#10;            Axis Player Display Card&#10;            Soviet Player Display Card&#10;            Last Blitzkrieg Addenda sheet&#10;            Four 22&rdquo; x 34&rdquo; Full Color Game Maps&#10;            1,680 Counters (four sheets of units and two BCS marker sheets)&#10;            10 scenarios total, 2 one-map scenarios, 4 are 5 turns or less&#10;            Box and Dice&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

All pieces are shaped alike and move alike, but they are of 4 different sizes, and the smallest piece has the letter T carved into it.

    "description": "A game of building monuments and historical sources, reporting on these monuments.&#10;&#10;In order to win the game, you not only have to build the monuments, you have to make sure that history will know them - and your fellow gamers will co-decide about it! And there are copyists, who will dispute the glory you've earned for your monuments...&#10;&#10;The game shows monument cards with 12 types of ancient monuments like the Pyramids or the Colosseum (9 per type). The game is played in turns and usually you take a &quot;monument turn,&quot; consisting of 3 actions allowing you to collect cards, to build monuments, and to expand your existing monuments. For example, it takes you one action per card to draw it either from the draw pile or the 3 faceup cards near it.&#10;&#10;If you have some cards showing the same monument, you can use another action to erect this monument in your display. In case you are the first one to build this type of monument, you only need two cards - the second player building this same type of monument must have at least 3 cards. And no third player is allowed to build the same monument! Thus, playing your cards early makes it easier for you to erect the monument. But it saves you actions to collect some cards before displaying it, because regardless of the number of cards used, erecting one monument only counts as one single action.&#10;&#10;Your monuments will receive their eternal fame only, if they are part of history. Each player has 2 (in a 3 player game: 3) historian tokens. In a historian turn, you have no monument action, but only write a history about all of your OPPONENTS' monuments (not your own ones!). Monuments get famous, and the owners receive victory points at the end of the game - the more often your monuments are in such histories, the more points you get. However, only interesting monuments of at least two cards are considered for a history, and by writing a history, the historian takes one card away (removes it from the game)! Thus the monument could be cut down to only one card during the game and will be not interesting to later historians any more. Why should I write a history and make the monuments of my opponents more worthy? If you do not use all of your historian tokens, you will be punished with 12 negative points at the end of the game! And you get additional victory points in the case that you write histories with a lot of monuments mentioned in it.&#10;&#10;You should make your monuments interesting to historians again. During a monument turn, you may use one action (regardless of the number of cards played at the same time) to add cards to a monument that you have already erected.&#10;&#10;In MONUMENTS, timing is important, and you have to decide what the best move to do now is: Should I wait for another Petra card, or shall I display the Petra Monument this turn? Is it advisable to make a historian turn now or is it better to choose a monument turn and draw the faceup cards, which I really need - taking the risk that I cannot write a history next turn and wind up getting negative points!&#10;&#10;Finally, you have to consider that you are not sure about the victory points for your monuments. The points are related to the monument during the game, and if the Akropolis monument is worth 12 Points for example, you will only get 4 points if another player manages to erect an Akropolis monument that is greater than yours. This damn copyist will not only receive all your bad wishes, but 8 of the 12 Akropolis Victory Points - even in the case that his monument was not part of any history. Somehow you will feel that all the glory should be given to you alone!&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Persian Gulf: Battle for the Middle East:&#10;&#10;Persian Gulf uses the same rules as the other games in the Third World War series to show a different aspect of modern warfare operations in the deserts and mountains of the middle east.&#10;&#10;Persian Gulf includes a special &quot;game within a game&quot;, covering the diplomatic, political, and military maneuvers by the Soviet Union and the United States in the Middle East before - and leading to - the general outbreak of the Third World War. Both sides try to gain control of the various Iranian factions and influence the other Middle Eastern nations. As the superpowers' confrontation continues, fighting breaks out between committed factions. Either side can decide to send troops to support their factions; the U.S. may send the Rapid Deployment Force while the Soviet Union may use its forces along its southern borders and in Afghanistan. Each move, however, escalates the conflict until the superpowers are directly fighting one another in the Middle East and their alliances in Europe are mobilizing for war.&#10;&#10;The four game maps cover the Persian Gulf region in detail. Centered on Iran and Iraq, the maps include bordering areas of Turkey, Saudi Arabia, the USSR, and Afghanistan. Mountains and sand dominate this area of the world, and wilderness rules show the effects of the scarcity of roads on military operations. &#10;Vying for control of the nations on these maps are the regional forces and those of the superpowers. These forces range greatly in capabilities: from the poorly-equipped and trained Iranian Revolutionary Guards and Soviet-controlled Afghan Army to the capable Turks to the elite Israeli and Jordanian intervention contingents. The Soviets have large forces available in their southern border regions and in Afghanistan. The small but strong U.S. RDF is on hand, and they can call on B-52 strikes for support.&#10;&#10;The rules cover the special political and military situations of the Middle East and the various Arab and Arab-Israeli rivalries are shown. Victory conditions take account of the oil resources of the Gulf. Additional rules allow Persian Gulf to be combined and played with the other three games in the Third World War series.&#10;&#10;",

They have five claim cards in hand, one for each sack and a &quot;skip&quot; card. Nine egg cards (valued 4-10) and three amber cards are shuffled, then two cards are removed from the game.&#10;&#10;In each of the ten rounds, someone reveals the top card of the egg deck, then each player simultaneously chooses and reveals a claim card. All players who didn't choose &quot;skip&quot; divide the eggs equally amongst themselves, then place these eggs in the sack that matches the card they played. Each player then sets aside the claim card he used, leaving it out of play for the next round, after which it returns to his hand.&#10;&#10;If an amber card is revealed, then if only one player plays &quot;skip&quot;, he claims the amber, setting it next to his sacks; if no players or two or three players play &quot;skip&quot;, then no one gets the amber.&#10;&#10;If a sack ever holds more eggs than the number on the sack, it rips and all the eggs fall to the ground and break. Pity. That player covers that sack with the matching claim card, which is now out of play for him.&#10;&#10;After ten rounds, the game ends, then players tally their scores. Each sack that holds exactly the right number of eggs is worth that many points; each sack holding fewer eggs is worth half as many points as the number of eggs in it, rounded down. Each amber is worth 4 points. The player with the most points is the ostrich egg champ!&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "This Guilty Land is a game about the political struggle over slavery in the United States in the decades prior to the American Civil War. The two players each represent an abstract idea - Justice and Oppression - while a third, non-player faction, Compromise, both helps and hinders them while seeking, insidiously, to maintain the untenable and abhorrent status quo.&#10;&#10;This is a card-driven game, but it's a rather atypical variation on that form. An Events Display contains cards belonging to both players and is public information. Cards played from the Events Display have effects depending on the type of card, and many cards can be placed into a player's Reserve, where they can be used throughout the game to take other sorts of actions. The size of one's Reserve is limited to the player's Organizational Capacity. This Capacity can be increased over the course of the game and also influences the strength of a player's actions, the minimum number of their cards drawn into the Display, and victory point opportunities.&#10;&#10;The game is asymmetrical in that each player's mix of cards within the deck either play to their strengths or emphasize their weaknesses. Like many of Ms. Holland's games, it is about deadlock, with each side countering the other until one of them blinks. Advantages multiply over time and a single mistake might make your position irrecoverable. Tempo and momentum are terribly important because, at its heart, this is a racing game.&#10;&#10;Both players score victory points for passing laws and forming political parties, and Justice scores victory points for growing support for their cause. Assuming neither player wins an instant victory by dominating the laws or reducing their opponents support to zero, the game ends when either the supply of victory points or the deck of cards is exhausted, and the player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;When the game ends, the American Civil War begins: the game's argument is that the Civil War was both inevitable and necessary, and through its mechanisms, the game seeks to illustrate why that is the case while still providing a deep and engaging play experience.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

Players partner with the player across from them and are each dealt 9 cards.&#10;&#10;The bid begins to the dealer's left at a minimum of four points and goes around the table, with players increasing the bid based on what they think they can take; if everyone passes the bid, the dealer is required to take the bid at four.  The player who announces the highest bid takes the position of dealer/leader and calls the trump suit, which is the only suit of import in this game (excepting the jokers and the left bauer or off-jack [jack of the same color, but not the trump suit]).  All players, save the dealer, discard all the cards from their hands that are not of the trump suit and request enough cards from the remaining 18-card deck to bring their hand up to 6. (*Note: If a player mistakenly discards a trump card, or one of the three other special cards, it is a free-for-all to whomever notices and picks it up off the table first)  The remaining cards in the deck are given to the bid-winner/leader, who can pick through them one-by-one, and pass any remaining unseen cards to his partner, each of them discarding to 6 before play begins.&#10;&#10;Play begins with the dealer/leader leading in the trump suit.  Play proceeds around the table, with the player playing the highest valued card taking the trick and leading the following trick.  Players may only play cards that are of the trump suit, other remaining cards are useless. If a player takes a trick and no longer has cards of the trump suit, that players is out, and the player to the left then begins the trick.  Cards are ranked from Ace to Two, with the Off-Jack, High Joker, and Low Joker respectively taking the positions between the Jack and Ten.&#10;&#10;Points are accrued by teams for taking the point cards in the tricks they take, which for 10-point pitch are Ace, Jack, Off-Jack (Left Bauer), High Joker, Low Joker (one has to rank higher than the other for play continuity), Ten, Three, and Two.  All are worth a point apiece, except the three, which is worth three.  The two is retained by the player who played it for his or her team and is not taken along with the trick.&#10;&#10;Both teams receive points for the point cards they take, unless the high-bidding team does not meet their bid goal, in which case they go &quot;set&quot; and lose their number of bid points instead of gaining.  Teams play to 52 points.&#10;&#10;Another option to bidding played in some areas is to &quot;shoot the moon.&quot; Shooting the moon means taking all 10 points. If the bid is shoot the moon the bidding team advances their score to 52 if their score was above zero or to zero if their score was below zero. Failure to score all ten points constitutes loss of game.&#10;&#10;&#10;Another version, playing for High, Low, Jack, and Game plays with hands of 6 cards.&#10;&#10;There are four possible points in a hand:&#10;&#10;High: highest trump card in play &#10;Low: lowest trump card in play; this point is retained by the team that played it regardless of who takes the trick&#10;Jack: Jack of trump, if in play&#10;Game: highest point total in tricks captured counting A - 4, K - 3, Q - 2, J - 1, and 10 - 10.&#10;&#10;&#10;        Variant - 6 point pitch: Jokers Add in high and low Jokers for a point each if in play. Their strength is between Jack and 10. They are always considered to be in the trump suit&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;Starting at the dealer's left, each player has one chance to bid, with a minimum bid of 2. Players can overbid a previous bid. The person who wins the bid gets to name trump. Dealer has to take the bid if everyone passes, so if you have a decent hand when your partner dealt, it's a good idea to put in a 2 bid if the first person didn't bid. Not only will your partner not get stuck, but the third person to bid won't get to take an easy 2 bid if they want it, and will have to go 3.&#10;&#10;If you bid and don't make it, you go down that many points. You can make points if your opponents bid.&#10;&#10;After the bid and declaration of trump, some people allow trashing and getting up to 2 new cards.&#10;&#10;The player who won the bid leads a trump card. After that, the person who won the previous trick leads. Players must follow the suit led if possible, or play any suit if not, and may trump in at any time. Highest card of the suit lead takes the trick, if no trump is played. If trump is played, highest trump takes it.&#10;&#10;First team to 21 points wins.&#10;&#10;&quot;Jersey Pitch&quot; adds the rule that the 5 of trump is worth 5 points.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "&quot;Le Donjon de Naheulbeuk&quot; is a cooperative game in which the players try to recover the last of Gladeulfeurha's statuettes.&#10;Players embody adventurers in this dungeon-crawling quest, each with a different class, skill and personality: there're the stupid barbarian, the belching ogre, the haughty sorceress, the dumb elf, the coward thief, the ever-singing bard, the cranky dwarf and the ranger who wishes he were a leader&hellip; (all the characters and elements of the game are inspired by the audio and comics saga by the same name, parodies of Fantasy RPG &mdash; &agrave; la Munchkin).&#10;&#10;In each game, the group must go through 14 of the 56 available dungeon rooms in order to defeat the powerful sorcerer Zangdar. In every room, players will face choices, skill checks or battles, and maybe rewards (as xp, gold or loot cards)&#10;&#10;There're 8 kind of skill checks, and each checks can slightly differ from the others of the same kind (number of players involved, special rule, etc.). Most of the skill checks use Destiny Tiles (which are 16 thick cards, which also represents monsters) and a special timer (with 3 difficulty levels)&#10;&#10;     Balance Check: the player must put a Destiny Tile on the top of his head, walk/run around and sit down again without letting the tile fall.&#10;     Climbing Check: the player must put a Destiny Tile on the top of his head, stand up on his chair, then sit down again without letting the tile fall.&#10;     Dexterity Check: the player must build a house of cards using Destiny Tiles.&#10;     Speed Check: the player must put a Destiny Tile on the edge of the table, then slap it up the air and catch it before it falls back down.&#10;     Precision Check: a player stands 3 steps from the table, holding the game box, and the others must throw Destiny Tiles into the box from the other side of the table.&#10;     Intelligence Check: players play a memory game with the 16 Destiny Tiles&#10;     Coordination Check: players stands a step from the table, and must circle all the Destiny Tiles around the table, throwing them from one player to the next.&#10;     Stamina Check: the player must stand on one leg, with a Destiny Tile on his other knee and another one on both of his forefingers, without dropping down either one.&#10;&#10;&#10;The battles are also timed and are played with Letter Cards, that can be exchanged one by one between 2 players. They are used to spell special words (several different words for each character) as blows to the enemy. Every time a player plays cards to spell a word, he draw 3 new cards and keep on playing. At the end of the battle, if there're enough blows, the enemy is defeated. For instance, the sorceress can cast a spell by spelling &quot;wazaaa&quot; with any number of a's at the end, wounding the enemy for every extra a's. The barbarian can misspell a letter in each of his word. The bard and the ranger can make other players draw cards. And so on&hellip; For every 3 cards played with a punch symbol on it, a player takes one wound him/herself.&#10;&#10;Using gold and/or xp, characters can level up (up to level 3) and gain access to more powerful attacks or skills. The party can rest up to 3 times a game to recover from one wound each. If a player dies, he shuffles his character sheet with the other available sheets and pick one : if it's the same, he  recovers all his health and keep all his loot, gold and xp; if it's another one, he dies, loses everything, and continues the game as a totally new character.&#10;&#10;If the players defeat Zangdar the Sorcerer in the 14th room (4 tiles with different rules so every game doesn't end the same way), they win the game.&#10;&#10;",

On a turn, a player can first draw as many cards as he likes, one at a time from the deck, placing them in the harbor (an area near the deck). Each card shows one of the following:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Person, who stays in a face-up row next to deck.&#10;     Ship, which the player can attack immediately if he has enough swords on his people cards, after which the ship is discarded; otherwise, the ship stays in the harbor.&#10;     Expedition, which remains above the harbor until a player fulfills it by discarding people who have the items required for the expedition.&#10;     Tax Increase, which forces everyone with twelve or more coins to discard half their money, after which the card is discarded.&#10;&#10;&#10;If the player draws a ship with the same name as a ship already in the harbor, he's spent too much time dilly-dallying and his turn ends (after using the ship to attack, if possible), with all the cards in the harbor being discarded. Otherwise, the player can stop whenever he likes, then use/acquire one card if three or fewer ships are in the harbor, two cards if four ships are present, and three cards if five ships are present. Players rob ships, collecting the number of coins shown on them, then discarding the card, while they hire people, paying the number of coins depicted. After the active player takes his 1-3 cards, each other player may pay the active player one coin in order to take one card in the same way.&#10;&#10;When one player has at least ten influence points &mdash; which are on both people and expedition cards &mdash; and has fulfilled at least one expedition, the game is played to the end of the round, giving everyone the same number of turns, then the player with the most influence points and at least one Expedition wins.&#10;&#10;",

This edition has a board that is a reproduction of the original found in the Mesopotamian city of Ur. Each player brings their 7 pieces in to play and takes them off of their outer track. Opposing pieces come into conflict on the inner track that they must travel on to the exit. If you land on a space occupied by a single opponent's piece you send it back to the start. If you land on a space occupied by 2 or more opponent's pieces then your piece goes back to the start.&#10;&#10;The four dice give a marked or blank result. They are tetrahedral (four-sided) dice.&#10;&#10;Each die gives a &quot;1&quot; or a &quot;0&quot;. You can roll 0,1,2,3, or 4. Statistically, 2 is most common- a good thing to bear in mind. The rosette in the central track is a &quot;safe&quot; place from which you cannot be bumped, but you can be bumped on others. Landing on any rosette allows you to roll again, but you don't need to move that same piece.&#10;&#10;All moves must be made by one piece only.&#10;&#10;First to bear off all 7 of his pieces wins.&#10;&#10;Note - Rules update in line with guidance from Irving Finkel from British Museum.&#10;&#10;The game may be a relative of Senet and Aseb.&#10;&#10;",

One by one you take turns picking up the top card and giving it to any (other) player you want. The cards can be a Bite (which brings you closer to becoming a wolf) or a Wound (which brings you closer to dead), or cards that cancel other cards. When a Night card is revealed, the full moon comes out and werewolves and humans get to pass cards anonymously, which is how the infection spreads and turns humans into wolves. Charms negate Bites and Salves negate Wounds.  3 Wounds (net) kill either a human or a werewolf. 3 Bites (net) turn a human into a werewolf, and only wolves can pass Bites at night.&#10;&#10;When the deck is exhausted at the end of the third night, Wolf Zero(es) begins to GROWL and slowly other wolves (even dead wolves) join the growl!

    "description": "In Journey: Wrath of Demons, a cooperative miniatures board game based on a classic Chinese novel, four Pilgrims band together to search ancient China for the Sutras, sacred scriptures that will bring salvation to a world overrun with Demons. After fighting different Bull Demon minions, the climax of the game is the battle against the Bull Demon King. Game cards and custom dice combine for fast, tense action and critical choices enhance the Pilgrims&rsquo; skills during the game.&#10;&#10;Journey is designed for 1 to 4 players, each controlling one of the four Pilgrims: Tripitaka, Monkey, Monk Sha and Cho Hakkai. The game's AI controls the Demons and other creatures. Diverse playing styles are possible, with a strong emphasis on cooperation because the players win or lose as a team. Each game will take 30 minutes to 2 hours, depending on the quest and the style you play.&#10;&#10;The core game comes with ~10 quests, each with different goals and unique rules. Do you ruthlessly hack and slash, killing all demons in the Pilgrims' path? Or take a more virtuous path, cleansing the demons' souls, saving villagers and collecting good karma. Your decisions affect the Pilgrims' abilities, skills and equipment. Killing demons may be quick but can you risk accumulating that bad karma? Side quests may enhance your Pilgrims' skill and karma, but with more demons spawning, can you afford to spend that time?&#10;&#10;Solo play is almost identical to multi-player games. Instead of multiple players controlling 1 or 2 pilgrims each, 1 player will control all four Pilgrims. There are no other changes to the game.&#10;&#10;",

All at the same time, each Pirate rushes to allocate crew in an effort to plunder the best loot by placing their crew meeples on individual items as bids. Each piece of treasure goes to the player with the most crew invested in the item, but only after removing all tied bids. Therefore, Pirates need to stay alert for sneaky opportunities to cancel out an opponent's efforts or for chances to swoop in and steal a disputed treasure.&#10;&#10;The unclaimed loot is auctioned off with doubloons earned by your crew and then the ship construction begins. Pirates score points for having the most money or equipment, or having the fastest, best, or largest ship. Sets of tiles and unfilled boat sections also add and subtract from your score. The player with the most points after eight rounds is the most notorious Pirate.&#10;&#10;A featured component of the game is the central loot chest formed by two double-sided boards with raised edges. Before each turn this treasure chest gets loaded with random face-down treasure, then it's sealed, flipped, and revealed simultaneously to the eager Pirates by removing the board on top. The mad rush of plundering in real-time (there is a 15-second sand timer included) and the spatial puzzle to build the best ship possible are the key ingredients of the game's experience.&#10;&#10;",

One player takes one mouse of each color, hides one in each palm, and has the other player pick a hand, thereby selecting what color they will be. Each player then places their mice in any configuration on the two closest grid intersection ranks. Shuffle the card deck and deal 3 cards to each player. Black goes first.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;PlayOn your turn, select one mouse and move it into any open space around it (up, down, left, or right). You may then play one of your cards targeting that mouse.&#10;&#10;Sword: Move in an L shape (move one space in any direction, then one perpendicular to your last move). Any mice encountered are pushed in the direction of your movement. If multiple mice are lined up, all are pushed. Mice pushed off the board or into one of the corners surrounding a Stronghold are captured and removed from play. You may not capture your own mice.&#10;&#10;Stronghold: Leap off the grid onto an adjacent square. Mice may not enter grid corners touching your square. Mice currently in such a grid corner are pushed back one space. Mice will try to move in the direction of their side of the board first. If they cannot move into an open space, the Stronghold cannot be played.&#10;&#10;    If you are in a stronghold, you may leave this position by moving to any of the grid corners touching the square and then moving once space. In this special movement case, you may not play a card.&#10;&#10;&#10;Diplomacy: Choose the nearest enemy mouse (a non-Stronghold mouse counts as occupying the 4 squares around it): &#10;&#10;    If they are in a stronghold, force them out and into an adjacent grid corner of your choice.&#10;    If not, switch places with that mouse.&#10;&#10;&#10;Rescue: If you have one of each card, play all of them and put one of your captured mice back on the board in any open setup position.&#10;&#10;Immediately after resolving a turn, draw cards until your hands size is 3. If there are not enough cards, draw what remains, shuffle the discard pile, and continue drawing.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;WinningBuild a stronghold in one of the enemy corners or capture all enemy mice.&#10;&#10;",

Most of these paths border two areas. Two hexagons are white and contain an X mark.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you roll five dice up to three times, keeping and re-rolling dice as you wish. Each die has a different color on each of its six sides. Once you stop, you can use the die results to X spaces on your game board, but only if you can X off all the spaces in that group. If you roll four orange and one red, for example, you can X off a group of two, three, or four orange hexagons, but not a group of five orange hexagons since you have only four orange on the dice.&#10;&#10;After you take your turn, each other player can X off one space on their game board for each die that you didn't use on your turn &mdash; but only if those spaces are adjacent to ones that are already Xed. If you marked off a group of three orange hexes, for example, then each opponent could mark off one orange and one red, assuming they are adjacent to previously marked spaces.&#10;&#10;When you mark off the final hex that borders an area, you score that area, earning 4-12 points depending on its size. Any other player who surrounds that area on a later turn receives only half as many points.&#10;&#10;As soon as a player completes their sixth area, you finish that turn, then everyone sums their points to see who wins.&#10;&#10;",

Because the keypad is a magic square (the sum of each row, column or diagonal is 15) the object of the game is to line up three markers or place three on the same key.&#10;&#10;Hack Trick gameplay is deceptively simple, but you&rsquo;ll see, that it hides many combinations. In his turn, the player may ask the sum of the opponent&rsquo;s hand, than play a card or draw. When he plays a card he may capture opponent markers, moreover, he may sacrifice a marker to force his opponent to play a card in the next turn, or contrarily, protect himself from being forced. Markers can be used in five different ways, but be careful, the player who runs out loses!&#10;&#10;Finally, the winner will be the player who knows how to defend and attack the positions, when to gather information, when to use the doubles, when to start a forced series, but above all how to find the right balance between forming a strong hand and tend to the final goal on the board.&#10;&#10;",

Then, a player rolls all available dice, and players begin their turns. On your turn, you place any available die on a monster, doing that die&rsquo;s value amount of damage.

    "description": "Dateline: Germany, 1933&#10;Jan. 30: Hindenburg names Hitler Chancellor.&#10;Feb. 27: The burning of the Reichstag. Hitler blames his political opponents and enacts repressive laws.&#10;Mar. 5: The Nazi Party wins the Federal elections amid a climate of fear and intimidation. From this point on, with a precise and constant rhythm, Hitler dismantles all of the democratic institutions of the fragile Weimar Republic and inaugurates a reign of terror, gradually establishing a ruthless and violent dictatorial regime.&#10;&#10;The above is history, but what would have happened if instead of bringing Europe into a maelstrom of war, the infamous Austrian corporal had abandoned his plan of global domination and taken the path of peace? Would World War II still have broken out? Or would the Nazi hierarchy and German industry still have pushed the F&uuml;hrer to war with Poland? What would the dream of a Greater Germany have been without Austria, Czechoslovakia, and the other German territorial claims? Would the Western plutocrats or the Soviet colossus have fought the fascist dictatorship anyway and nevertheless inexorably triggered global conflict?&#10;&#10;Democracy under Siege is an interactive simulation enabling you to explore all such questions. A card-driven strategy game, it reproduces the geopolitical conflicts and political struggles that led to the Second World War. The game covers the period 1933-1940 and is designed for two or three players. Each takes the role of one of the three ideologies &mdash; Democracy, Nazism and Communism &mdash; that struggled for power during the timeline of the game. (When played by two players, the two Ideologies exclusively under player control are Democracy and Nazism, while control of Communism alternates between the two players from turn to turn according to specific rules.)&#10;&#10;Each game turn represents one year and is divided into three or four rounds. Players choose one political action and one event per round and attempt to perform the political action by rolling a die and applying some modifiers. They can affect the outcomes of their attempts by expending the ideology's political prestige. Events are activated immediately before the political actions are attempted; no die roll is required. If the political action succeeds, the card effects are applied accordingly. In any case, even when the attempt is unsuccessful, the political action cards played provide a varying number of political points (PP) that can later be expended by the players to perform activities.&#10;&#10;After political actions, players perform their action round with the PP provided by political action cards. Players can influence the political allegiance of minor countries, exploit the economic resources belonging either to minor nations or to their controlled powers, recruit and activate coup cells to attempt coups d'etat to overthrow a minor country regime, send military forces to local conflicts or intervene in a civil war in a minor nation. All of these activities, as well as the effects of successful political actions, can bring victory points (VP) when the political allegiances of minor countries come under the influence or the control of Ideologies, or when territories or nations are conquered.&#10;&#10;At the end of each round, players check the outcomes of coup attempts, then proceed to a new round. During the clean-up phase at the end of each turn, players perform end-turn checks and calculate the production of military resources (MR) by the exploitation of economic resources claimed on the map. MR are put in the ideologies' force pool and expended to maintain the minor nations allegiances. The remaining MR provide additional VP and can be employed during the subsequent turns to intervene in local conflicts and civil wars.&#10;&#10;Democracy under Siege offers an accurate and detailed historical context, supported by 108 strategy cards. Players exploit historical events and political actions to achieve political supremacy. Wars are simulated by an abstract combat system that allows players to intervene and influence their outcomes. The main concepts reproduced in the game are the ideological struggles among the major powers, the race for armaments ahead of World War II and the buildup of a network of diplomatic links with minor nations. All of these elements combine to determine victory.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Two millennia ago, a loose federation of planets combined to form the Galactic Empire. From that small beginning, the Empire ruthlessly expanded, enslaving or exiling all races that were a threat to their dominion. Recently, the Empire has suffered revolts from conquered races, and on the barren galactic rim, the exiled races gather their forces to strike at the weakened Empire. As the Empire's might and influence wane, a new era is dawning. Which new race will ascend to power?&#10;&#10;Omega Centauri is a game of galactic empire building for 2 to 4 players. The play map is made up of sector tiles, and at the beginning of the game the majority of the map is Empire-controlled resource sectors. A variety of map layouts are included and the size of the map depends on the number of players. During each round of play, you have the opportunity to perform three of five possible actions:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Assemble (place your fleets into sectors with shipyards)&#10;     Build (build monuments, construct shipyards, and erect planetary defenses)&#10;     Move (move fleets into a sector or out of a sector)&#10;     Politics (gain resources or increase your fleet capacity)&#10;     Research (select an available technology)&#10;&#10;&#10;In the base game, players take turns each round selecting and executing one action at a time until each player has taken three actions, then a new round begins. The base game offers a compelling mix of strategic planning and tactical play, as players must balance their long term goals for development and for technology acquisition with the need to take advantage of the opportunities that arise during action selection.  The base game provides a streamlined 4x experience that can be completed in about an hour.&#10;&#10;The advanced game differs from the base game in several important respects. First, the advanced game introduces improved technologies, racial powers, and other elements to provide a more complex and flavorful gaming experience. It also requires players to select all three of their actions (and the order that they will be performed in) at the start of every round. Thus, to succeed, you must carefully plan your turn, anticipate your opponents' actions, and more successfully execute your overall strategy. Reserve Fleet Actions are added, giving an important boost and a use for spare fleets, through these (and spending valuable resources) players can take an extra action. Finally, through the Politics Action, the full game allows players to select goals that award victory points at the end of the game based upon how well the player has carried out a specific agenda. The full game provides an epic 4x experience in around two hours with variable powers, advanced technologies, and numerous paths to victory.&#10;&#10;Throughout the game, you will be compelled to make important decisions regarding how to advance your civilization: Will you focus on obtaining technological or cultural superiority, or will you build an invincible armada to crush those who stand in your way? The winner of the game will be the player who has accumulated the most victory points at the end of the final round of play. Omega Centauri offers players many routes to victory, and you can accumulate victory points (VPs) by wresting control of sectors of space from the Empire (or from other players), by improving your infrastructure and planetary defenses, or by expanding your cultural influence. The player with the most VPs at the end of the final round is deemed to have ascended and established the new dominant Empire in the galaxy.&#10;&#10;",

The new Spy mode pits you against an automata enemy spy who creates problems you need to address until your deck is strong enough to end the game.&#10;&#10;Unlockable cards that continue to expand the card pool and introduce new abilities..&#10;&#10;A classic variant pack so that you can still play Paperback the classic way.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

One by one, a Quokka, Crocodile, Platypus, Echidna, Snake, and Kangaroo will try to sneak food away from the barbie. Making off with any food is good, but those sausages sure look the tastiest!&#10;&#10;The game is played over six rounds, with players taking turns in clockwise order. On your turn, your goal is to roll and re-roll dice to get many of the same Critter together with high values on the Food dice.&#10;&#10;You can choose any Critter you wish for scoring but beware! You can only score one Critter each round, and each Critter can only be scored ONCE during the entire game.&#10;&#10;But what about the Sausages?!?&#10;&#10;Normally a Sausage on the Food dice counts as a 1, but if you manage to lock in all four of your Food dice showing Sausages, the value of a Sausage jumps up to 7 that round!&#10;&#10;What is a Sausage Sizzle?&#10;&#10;A traditional Aussie Sausage Sizzle consists of a beef sausage (a &ldquo;snag&rdquo;), in a slice of white bread, with grilled onions and sauce, usually tomato or BBQ. It has become an icon of Aussie outdoor living and a mainstay at community events.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "The Frostrivers tribe dwells along the Great Frozen River. Its members live in harmony with Nature. The tribe obeys the laws of the Four Elders, themselves guided by the most venerable of the Elders, the Neta-Tanka. When the Neta-Tanka enters the twilight of life, the Frostrivers gather at the Sacred Grounds to designate a successor. During this ceremony, each clan presents a young leader who will need to demonstrate generosity and the ability to provide for the tribe in order to become the new Neta-Tanka.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;When it is your turn, place a worker on the board. All the players place their workers, one at the time, until everybody has placed all their workers.&#10;&#10;Then, in the order of the turn, the players trigger all their workers.&#10;&#10;Think ahead, because some actions require other actions to be triggered beforehand! For example, if you want to get pelts, the &quot;Hunt&quot; action must have been triggered earlier in the turn. And when you skin the game to get the pelts, then the meat becomes available for the other players. It is crucial to remember the turn's order when you place your workers, or they might have nothing to do when you resolve your actions!&#10;&#10;Another key point of the game is that the spots on the board are linked with each other. Triggering 2 actions that are linked with each other gives you a boost (by improving those actions, or giving you extra resources, ...).&#10;&#10;There are different ways of scoring points in the game. You score points by:&#10;&#10;     Building tents for your tribe&#10;     Feeding your tribe&#10;     Handcrafting objects&#10;     Raising the highest Totem for the deities&#10;     Showing generosity to your opponents&#10;&#10;&#10;The player with the most points at the end is declared N&#196;&#147;t&#196;&#129;-Tanka!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Tranquility: The Ascent is a standalone sequel to Tranquility, with players working together to complete a grid of numbers as they scale the mountain.&#10;&#10;Starting at the bottom of the mountain, players are tasked with completing a pyramid-shaped grid from the base to the summit. The base of the mountain is nine cards wide, the row above that is eight, and so on, with the top row consisting of a single summit card played once the rest of the grid is complete. On your turn, you must play a card onto the mountain or discard two cards. Cards are numbered between 1 and 12 and feature one of three different types of terrain. You may not play cards of the same terrain type next to one another, and you must also discard the difference between cards when played next to one another, e.g. placing a 7 next to a 4 would require you to discard three cards.&#10;&#10;Rows are completed from left-to-right, and the numbers on the cards can ascend, descend, or remain the same. Rows can include any number barring this one restriction: the number on a terrain card must be equal to or higher than the number of the row, which means that a 1 can be played only in the first row whereas numbers 8-12 can be played on any row.&#10;&#10;You can start a new row once at least the first two cards in the row below have been placed. Cards must always be &quot;supported&quot; by the two cards immediately below them, but they do not relate to the rows above or beneath in any way, i.e., the first row could start with a 10 while the next row starts with a 1.&#10;&#10;If players complete the mountain and top it with a summit card, they win; if a player cannot take an action on their turn, everyone loses.&#10;&#10;Tranquility: The Ascent includes three mini-expansion modules that can be added separately or together. &quot;The Green Path&quot; requires players to form a continuous path from the bottom to the top of the mountain. &quot;The Panorama&quot; module gives players specific number sequences to photograph. And finally, herd &quot;The Mountain Goats&quot; up to the summit where the grass is greener in the final module.&#10;&#10;",
