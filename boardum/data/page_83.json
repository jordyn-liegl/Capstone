One or more players serve as overseers &mdash; emergency room managers, as it were &mdash; and they give tasks to the other medical personnel on hand: find a combination of drugs in this batch of cards; figure out the dose you need to administer by consulting this chart; stitch up a wound by &quot;stitching&quot; on a game board with needle and thread; and so on. If you complete all of the treatments before the final heart attack on the soundtrack, you are victorious! If not, you'll have to receive additional training...&#10;&#10;",

Money can be used for bonus promotions, e.g. B. to obtain wild resources or to search a stack and select a tile.&#10;&#10;The game ends when all tile stacks have been used up. Each pyramid is worth points depending on how far a player has occupied the pyramid. Leftover resources and money are also worth points.&#10;&#10;Terra Pyramides comes with two expansions in the box.

Can you thwart the Luftwaffe&rsquo;s bombing missions, tear the heart out of their bomber and fighter squadrons and survive long enough to win the game?&#10;&#10;Take command of Luftflotte 2 and 3 in Northern France and Luftlotte 5 in Norway and use your numerous bomber squadrons, protected by your numerous fighter squadrons, to complete a number of specific bombing missions to win the game. But don&rsquo;t be fooled by your starting strength! Your losses will not be replaced as the Spitfires and Hurricanes carve holes in your ranks. Your medium bombers are not really suited to mass strategic bombing and will struggle to complete their missions. Your fighter squadrons, although mainly composed of the excellent Messerschmidt 109, will struggle with fuel, not having the range and endurance to protect your bombers properly.&#10;&#10;In addition, the Plastic Soldier Company has added its plastic miniature expertise to create some fantastic little 1/300th scale plastic airplane models.&#10;&#10;",

As such, players become a warrior, elf, cleric, or magician, then wander around the board collecting treasure and resolving encounters.  The Emperor's six magic artifacts are both high-powered magic items and a countdown clock, as when enough have been found, the game ends. (Exactly how many depends on number of players.)&#10;&#10;Treasure, encounters and equipment are all randomized with chits in three cups. Characters obtain them by fighting monsters or lucky die rolls on result charts associated with various board locations (e.g., castles, villages, The Wizard's Tower, The Pirate Lair, etc.).  Not all encounters are monsters -- some are travelers who will bestow treasure upon completion of quests, others are annoyances, and there's even Imperial Guard patrols looking to confiscate the Emperor's Treasure.&#10;&#10;Terrain types are a key strategy feature, as a player whose current location's terrain doesn't match the encounter drawn can bestow it on someone else who does.  So a character in rugged forest or mountains can get stuck fighting several monsters in succession during other players' turns.&#10;&#10;A surprising amount of flavor is included for a magazine game.  There's an assortment of magic spells, ranged and close combat, magical weapons &amp; armor, damsels in distress, evil wizards, a volcanic demon, even a wandering elephant.&#10;&#10;A significantly revised version was published as part of The Best of Dragon Magazine Games.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "(from Decision Games website:)&#10;&#10;WACHT am Rhein, the Battle of the Bulge, is a grand-tactical simulation of that enormous battle. The more than 2,380 counters represent every formation, at company and battalion levels, which fought there, including US, German, British, French, Canadian and Belgian units. Infantry, armor, anti-tank, reconnaissance, engineer, assault gun, howitzer, rocket, parachute, ranger, glider and headquarters units are all fully represented. The four maps are an accurate representation of the region. Compiled from 1944 German staff maps and 1943-44 1:50,000 US Army maps, they shows all roads, trails and other types of terrain, along with all the towns and villages that became bastions of the American defense, as well as every creek and river that couldn&rsquo;t be crossed by wheeled vehicles without a bridge.&#10;&#10;PLAYERS may use single maps for six smaller scenarios. There is also a campaign game that utilizes all four sections and portrays three weeks  (50 game turns). In that one the Germans race for the Meuse, the last hurdle before the open country leading to Antwerp, in the face of increasing concentrations of Allied infantry, armor and air power. Extensive supply, weather and air power rules are included.&#10;&#10;THIS edition of Wacht am Rhein presents modifications to the combat, artillery and supply systems of the first edition in order to better depict tactical and operational warfare. For example, an &ldquo;exploitation mode&rdquo; has been added in order to allow mechanized units to take advantage of breakthroughs in the enemy line. Other changes include the addition of &ldquo;vantage points,&rdquo; which function as high ground, enabling units to spot more effectively for artillery, as well as &ldquo;constricted terrain,&rdquo; which represents the channeling caused by steep gullies and ravines.&#10;&#10;Game scale:&#10;&#10;     Map: 1 mile per hex&#10;     Time: 3 Game Turns per day&#10;     Units: Infantry and Artillery units are battalions. Armor is depicted at the company level.&#10;     Each strength step is equal to a company.&#10;&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;    4 22x34&rdquo; Four Color Map sheets&#10;    2,380 Die-Cut Playing Pieces&#10;    One Rule Booklet&#10;    One Scenario Booklet&#10;    Assorted Player Aid Charts&#10;    Two 10-sided Dice&#10;    Storage Bags&#10;    11x17x2 inch box&#10;&#10;&#10;",

It uses the popular Civil War Brigade Series rules with a set of specially adapted extension rules for Regimental scale action.&#10;&#10;The research for the six maps was done using multiple Park histories, battlefield surveys and county historical maps. These maps show the battlefield (and its environs) in more detail than ever before.&#10;&#10;Multiple scenarios in an assortment of sizes make This Terrible Sound &quot;just right&quot; for players of various skill levels and space allowances- it can be as small and quick, or as large and in-depth as just about any player desires.

Each players chooses a card and plays them simultaneously. Whoever plays the highest card dives deepest and grabs the card at the bottom of the lake, while the next highest card grabs the card just above this. Whoever played the lowest card collects what's at the surface. Sometimes this isn't good since jellyfish cost you points and seagulls steal your most recent catch.&#10;&#10;May the best diver win!&#10;&#10;",

The game board is a 4x4 grid, with a stack of three mosquito tokens placed at the nine internal intersections of this grid.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player moves either their toucan or chameleon. To move the chameleon, you first eat one of the mosquitoes sitting on a corner of its current space, then move it one square orthogonally. To move the toucan, you move it diagonally from one square to another, eating the top mosquito that you pass over; the toucan can move more than one space in a single movement, but you must be able to eat from each corner space that you cross. If you cannot feed one of your animals, then you can't move it. If you can't feed either of them, then you lose the game.&#10;&#10;If you eat nine yellow mosquitoes, you win the game instantly. The game also has mosquitoes of other colors that have special powers: move one mosquito, move one of your animals, force the opponent to play with a particular animal, etc.&#10;&#10;",

This edition includes over 200 beautifully sculpted plastic miniatures and two ways to play: Classic Britannia (traditional play for 4 gamers on the standard board) and Duel Britannia (faster play for 2 gamers on a new board).&#10;&#10;Britannia allows players to recreate the turbulent history of Britain from the coming of the Romans (AD 43) to conquest by the Normans (AD 1085). Each player controls several tribes and leaders including the Angles, Saxons, Irish, Norsemen, Danes, Boudicca, King Arthur, Offa, and many other recognisable names from British history. The power of each tribe will rise and fall as the game progresses through the centuries, so players must work out when to expand and when to consolidate each.&#10;&#10;Classic Britannia plays in the way all Britannia fans know and love, benefiting from Lew Pulsipher&rsquo;s continued development and player feedback. Duel Britannia is a new, fast-playing adaptation for two players, on a new board including Ireland.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

As the king of a country, you will select the six best wizards from your kingdom and decide the order in which they will compete. Yes, your role ends there, and all that remains is to watch your trusted wizards battle it out.&#10;&#10;In Wizards Cup, you want to build the best team you can, anticipating how your opponent might attack. Each player starts with a set of 18 cards, and your opponent draws a card at random from your deck that must be one of the wizards on your team. You then choose five more wizards, arrange five of the six wizards into a deck, then place the sixth aside in a waiting zone.&#10;&#10;Each player reveals their top wizard and places it in the duel zone, then you see who wins. Resolve wizard powers first, then (if needed) compare the elements on these cards (e.g., light beats shadow, nature beats water); if they share the same element, compare values. The losing wizard heads to that player's discard pile, then they draw the next wizard from their deck to go against the opposing victorious wizard. Keep resolving duels until a player has no cards remaining; the other player claims a victory token.&#10;&#10;Each player can then swap one wizard from their six with an unused card, after which they again create a five-card deck and duel.

    "description": "On March 23, 1862 and then again on July 24, 1864 the area around Kernstown, Virginia witnessed clashes between Union and Confederate forces. The Pritchard House and Pritchard's Hill were central to both battles as they abutted the Valley Turnpike.&#10;&#10;At First Kernstown, Stonewall Jackson erred in taking scouting reports at face value and so he unknowingly attacked a superior Union force. With Union Commander James Shields laying wounded back in Winchester, Colonel Nathan Kimball ignored Shields' orders and managed, and mismanaged, the battle his way. Though Jackson's men ran out of ammunition and fled the field, Stonewall's only tactical loss became a strategic victory as Union Commanders overestimated the size of Jackson's force. The Union forces could have crushed Jackson, stopped his Valley Campaign before it really got started and perhaps allowed McClellan to end the war in 1862.&#10;&#10;On July 24, 1864, Union Commander George Crook ignored his scouting reports and ordered his forces to attack what he thought was a small body of Confederate cavalry and skirmishers. Generals Jubal Early and especially General John Breckinridge led their forces well and routed Crook's men. Only the failure of the Confederate cavalry to cut the Union retreat routes prevented the annihilation of Crook's army. Better Union leadership and troop placement could have made this battle much harder for the Confederates to win.&#10;&#10;&#226;&#128;&#139;Kernstown is a game simulating the fighting on March 23, 1862 and July 24, 1864 around Kernstown. The game is specifically designated to be a playable regimental-scale simulation of these two conflicts and some scenarios can be completed in a long evening. This is the fourth ACW game published by Revolution Games which features the &quot;Blind Swords&quot; chit-pull system. This mechanic emphasizes the three &quot;FOW's&quot; of military conflict: fog-of-war, friction-of-war, and fortunes-of-war. With each chit pull, players will be challenged to make tough decisions based on their assessment of the situation at that moment.&#10;&#10;Components:  One 22x34&quot; map; 2 x  5/8&quot; counter-sheets (352 counters); Rulebooklet; 5 charts/playeraids; Box or ziploc bag; 2 dice (Boxed version only).&#10;&#10;&#226;&#128;&#139;Game Information:  Complexity: 6 out of 10.

    "description": "The Last Hundred Yards Vol. 3: The Solomon Islands is the third game in the Last Hundred Yards Series. This game focuses on the vicious and brutal Solomons Campaign, including actions to control the islands of Guadalcanal, Bougainville, and New Georgia.&#10;&#10;When you play the Solomon Islands Campaign missions, you will experience some of the fiercest small unit actions in the Pacific Theater. The game will focus on actions involving the 1st (The Old Breed) and 3rd (Fighting Third) Marine Divisions, as well as the Army&rsquo;s 25th Infantry Division&mdash;the unit that finally drove the Japanese off the island, earning them the nickname &ldquo;Tropic Lightning.&rdquo;&#10; Take to the jungles of Guadalcanal with the 1st Marine Division as they begin the first ground offensive of the war. Landed onto Guadalcanal and with intermittent naval support as the struggle for naval supremacy raged offshore, the Marines fought tooth and nail to secure their small foothold around Henderson Airfield. They fought against Japanese Reinforcements coming from all over the South Pacific area. Engage in bitter jungle fighting with the 3rd Marine Division as they attempt to hold and expand the beachhead on Bougainville Island against the Imperial Japanese 6th Infantry Division.&#10;&#10;Finally, serve with the 25th Infantry Division&rsquo;s famed 27th Regiment, the &ldquo;Wolfhounds,&rdquo; as they try to reduce Japanese positions on Guadalcanal&rsquo;s Galloping Horse Ridge (an action that is portrayed in the movie &ldquo;The Thin Red Line&rdquo;). You will also fight with the Wolfhounds in the jungle around Munda Point for the airfield on New Georgia. Each of these actions involved tense jungle warfare and the routing out of fanatical Japanese units from hidden bunkers and pillboxes. You will understand the nerve-racking frustration of clearing an enemy position, only to have infiltrators attack you yet again from a different direction, at night!&#10; This volume introduces new weapons and terrain including flamethrowers, anti-tank halftracks, light and heavy jungle. Each mission will provide new challenges with different elements, forces, and situations encountered, making this volume an exciting and nail-biting addition to The Last Hundred Yard Series.&#10;&#10;This game is a stand alone game. It does NOT require ownership of The Last Hundred Yards to be played.&#10;&#10;",

The players control the destiny of intrepid explorers setting out on expeditions to far off regions of the world. Fantastic animals, beautiful orchids, glittering treasures, lost explorers, maps and more all await discovery. However, fame and fortune will only come to those brave enough to trek into the untamed wilds.&#10;&#10;Exploriana is played over several rounds, each split into a number of phases. Each round, players recruit explorers, ranging from photographers and detectives to scholars, medics and more. They then decide which of three far flung regions of the world they wish to send their explorers; South America, Africa or The Far East. Those explorers then lead expeditions into the deep jungles, endless savannah and mist swathed mountains of these strange new lands.&#10;&#10;Exploration is a dangerous pursuit, perils lurk around every corner waiting to doom an expedition to failure! Explorers rely on their skills and wit to get them through, but if their expedition runs into too much trouble they could become lost, perhaps never to be seen again! The players must decide just how far to push their luck and see if fortune really does favour the bold!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "This game is best played with people knowing each other. On 156 cards are, printed on both sides, 3 sentences, where a part of the sentence is replaced by &quot;WALTER&quot;, like &quot;If I had a dog, I'd call him &quot;WALTER&quot;&quot; or &quot;I would like to be reborn as &quot;WALTER&quot;&quot;. Purpose of the game is that one is the &quot;Sphinx&quot;, who calls out the three sentences (one by one), notes down his &quot;WALTERS&quot; (his propositions numbered from 1 to 3) and the other players do the same trying to find propositions which do suit the &quot;Sphinx&quot;'s personality. After this round the &quot;Sphinx&quot; takes all the propositions and reads them out (from 1 to 3, but in disorder for every sentence). Now the players note on an other paper, which propositions they think are the right ones, that means those of the &quot;Sphinx&quot;, the &quot;Wahre Walter&quot;s. Players do get points for every &quot;Wahre Walter&quot;, they noted and the &quot;Sphinx&quot; too gets points every time someone &quot;bets&quot; on his propositions, so the &quot;Sphinx&quot; has to be himself, the best possible. Furthermore do players, on whose propositions other players have bet get points, because they have successfully &quot;faked&quot; the &quot;Sphinx&quot;. So as said before, the players should known each other (despite the possibility to give &quot;strangers&quot;, some points of advance) and you need a lot of pieces of paper.&#10;&#10;",

They then add this tile to the rest of the forest, covering at least one-quarter of an existing tile. You can cover existing squares only if the covering squares have more clan members on them (or a bear as the bear beats them all).&#10;&#10;You also have a tower you can place on an empty square of a tile that you just placed, scoring points for having clan members on adjacent tiles &mdash; but the sooner you place your tower, the sooner your opponents will have a big clue on which clan actually belongs to you!&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "In this clever racing game, cars move around a 30-space track on which the spaces are numbered from 1 to 10, then 1 to 10 again, then 1 to 10 for a third time.  The cards have different powers depending on which number your car is sitting on.  For instance, a card might move you 8 spaces if you're sitting on an 8, but only 3 spaces otherwise.  Cards go in and out of your hand at a rapid rate as you play and discard your way through a series of races, and card management skills will come in handy if you've got them.  Each race goes by quite quickly, but the game consists of a whole series of races -- 11 if you play with the full complement of 3 cars each for 4 players or 2 cars each for 6 -- the gimmick being that, at the end of each race, the car that came in last is removed from the game, and the next race has one fewer starters -- and so on until the game is down to the last two cars and the last race for the ultimate victory.&#10;&#10;Originally released as Devil takes the Hindmost which has the same mechanics but is a cycling-racing game.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Game description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;The year is 1947, and World War II still rages, fueled by the discovery of alien technology. The world's superpowers have developed unprecedented weaponry, including lasers, phaser cannons, and massive combat walkers. These war machines stride across the battlefield, protected by their heavy armor, and devastate enemy troops with their fearsome cannons.&#10;&#10;In Dust Warfare, players assume the roles of generals, each commanding a custom-built army of squads, walkers, and heroes. Draw upon Axis might or Allied versatility as you wage ferocious battles for control of the rare ore, VK, needed to fuel the most powerful of the superpowers' weapons.&#10;&#10;The Dust Warfare rulebook introduces unprecedented player engagement. Players first get drawn into the action during the Command Phase, where you have to choose how to spend command points during an escalating battle. You might spend command points early and often to advance and sustain an early lead, or you might save them up for dramatic late-game effects that may decisively turn the tide of battle. The Command Phase presents players with the chance to exert their influence and command style upon the field of battle in an engaging new way.&#10;&#10;Players have the chance to activate all their forces during the Unit Phase, and reaction mechanisms keep you fully engaged throughout your opponent's turns. As enemy units close in on yours or begin to open fire, you can choose to spend actions from your next turn to react. Keen commanders will make good use of their reaction options. They will also learn how best to feint and bait their opponents to react, draining them of available actions.&#10;&#10;Designed by renowned miniatures guru Andy Chambers, the Dust Warfare: Core Rulebook integrates dynamic and engaging new game design with the stunning models from Dust Tactics. Dust Warfare players build armies from the exact same set of miniatures as Dust Tactics. As both games go forward, they will continue to draw from the same wealth of fantastically detailed miniatures.&#10;&#10;Integrates with:&#10;&#10;    Dust Tactics&#10;    Dust Tactics: Revised Core Set&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Arena mode lets 2-8 players fight one another in a battle royale setting.&#10; In a two player game, players choose which team to control, the fantasy team consisting of Brog, Gildri, and Randar, or the Wasteland team consisting of Exile, Firebug, Penny, and Lost Boy. &#10;At the beginning of the game, each player has the same deck of ten cards, which contain seven &ldquo;1&rdquo; cards and three &ldquo;0&rdquo;cards. The first player draws five cards, and adds the total of their values. That number represents the number of actions the player can use for their team. Actions can be moving one space or attacking. These actions can be spread across the entire team, or used by only one character, depending on a character&rsquo;s traits. &#10;During an attack, the attacking player rolls the number of dice equivalent to the attacking character&rsquo;s attack stat. The defending player rolls the number of dice equal to the defending character&rsquo;s defense dice. The number of reds rolled are added up, and the defender takes damage equal to the number of reds the attacking character rolls above the total of their defending roll.&#10; Each player then adds up the number of green dice they rolled, and earns one coin for each green die.&#10; coins are saved up and used to buy new weapons from the weapon marketplace, to destroy &ldquo;zero&rdquo; cards in their hands, to purchase better cards from the main deck, or upgrade their individual character stats.&#10; Each character has an upgrade shop. Players can choose any of the available stats to upgrade in any order for any of their characters, and spend the appropriate amount of tokens to get those upgrades. When a character is fully upgraded, that character unlocks their special power, which is unique for each character.&#10; When a character is killed, the player who killed that character earns the number of victory points printed on the character&rsquo;s upgrade shop card, and the player whose character was killed draws a &ldquo;zero&rdquo; card from the &ldquo;zeroes&rdquo; pile for every victory point listed on the killed character&rsquo;s upgrade shop card and adds it to their discard pile. The killed character respawns in their base immediately, but that character cannot move or attack on their next turn, and effectively loses a turn while respawning. &#10;The first player to reach ten victory points wins the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Each successful mission brings news of monstrous foes and terrifying events as the heroes explore the modular Citadel.

Teams have secret secondary missions which may be at odds with the rest of the teams in the game and doomtrooper cards can give tactical advantages or be discarded to take an extra action.&#10;&#10;As players take it in turns to play the Dark Legion they get to control the vast Citadel of Alakhai on Venus, its defences and the terrifying creatures ready to do battle with humankind. Each turn they will summon reinforcements, play event cards to further challenge the doomtroopers and try to defeat their friends with the forces of the Dark Legion. If the Dark Legion player does well at the role, his doomtrooper team gains promotion points to advance their characters&rsquo; rank for when they play the next mission!&#10;&#10;",

For the players in charge of the Hungarian defense, there is no time left for organizing and sedition. This is a hopeless war of survival, plain and simple.&#10;&#10;Combining card and action management mechanisms of modern euro games with the theme and feel of a classic block wargame, players can experience the rush of a true no-win scenario, and see how long they can keep the flame of the revolution going under the pressure of the unstoppable march of the Soviet military machine.&#10;&#10;The game can be played by up to two revolutionary players against either a live or an automated opponent.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "The card game L.A.M.A. Kadabra plays similarly to the 2019 game L.L.A.M.A., but with a few additions that complicate gameplay and your choices of what to do.&#10;&#10;Let's start with the basics of L.L.A.M.A.: Each player starts a round with six cards in hand; the deck consists of llama cards and cards numbered 1-6. On a turn, the active player can play a card, draw a card, or quit. To play a card, you must play the same number as the top card of the discard pile or one number higher. If a 6 is on top, you can play a 6 or a llama, and if a llama is on top, you can play another llama or a 1. If you quit, you place your remaining cards face down and take no further actions. If all players have quit but one, that player can continue to play, but cannot draw more cards.&#10;&#10;The round ends when one player empties their hand or all players have quit. In either case, players collect chips based on the cards in their hand. Each different number card in hand gets you white chips (each worth 1 point) equal to the value of the card while one or more llamas gets you a black chip (worth 10 points). (You can exchange ten white chips for one black chip at any time.) If you played all your cards, you can return one chip (white or black) that you previously collected to the supply. You then shuffle all the cards and begin a new round, in which the first player to play will be the one who emptied their hand or was the last one to quit in the previous round.&#10;&#10;L.A.M.A. Kadabra adds four new elements to the gameplay described above:&#10;&#10;&bull; Double cards: Some cards show two numbers: 2/3 and 4/5. You can play a 2/3 on a 1, a 2, or a 3, so they give you more flexibility, but if you end the round with one in hand, it counts as both numbers when you're collecting chips.&#10;&#10;&bull; Action cards: When you play a 1, give one of your lowest chips &mdash; yes, including a black chip if that's all you have &mdash; to any player who hasn't yet quit. When you play a card with a rectangle on it, the next player to take a turn must draw a card, then take their turn as normal.&#10;&#10;&bull; The magic chip: When you play a card with a star, claim the lone blue magic chip from whoever currently holds it. On a future turn, you can discard the chip to skip your turn. If you hold this chip (and no white ones) when you play a 1, give this to another player. If you hold the magic chip at the end of the round, it's worth 10 points.&#10;&#10;&bull; The magic show: Whenever you play a llama, place one of your lowest chips on the magic stage. When the magic stage has at least five chips on it, the magic show begins. During a magic show, if you play a llama, place one of your lowest chips on the magic stage; if you can't or don't want to play a llama, take all of the chips on stage to end the magic show, then take your turn as normal.&#10;&#10;The game ends at the end of the round where at least one player has forty or more total points. Whoever has the fewest points wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "In Bone Wars, players take on the role of a palaeontologist in the late 1800s. During this time, a bitter rivalry was waged between Othniel Marsh and Edward Cope, two world-renowned palaeontologists. They both tried to outdo the other in discovering new species of dinosaurs, going so far as to bribe workers, steal or even destroy bones. The players are palaeontologists working for one of these legendary men or are perhaps working on their own behalf &ndash; trying to outdo all competition.&#10;&#10;During the game, players have to make clever use of their action cards, which they play in the slots under their player board. These action cards can either activate their team - digging up fossils and discovering new species in the field - or their paleontologist - who spend their time publishing species, debunking other players' papers and getting awards.&#10;&#10;Published species cards are added to bonus slots at the top of your player board. Each added species card gives a bonus depending on how many species cards are already in that specific slot.&#10;&#10;When your paleontologist publishes a paper, it is added to either Marsh's or Cope's side, depending on which side the player is working for. Specific actions will also reward loyalty points with your current patron. At the end of the game, players multiply the number of loyalty they have (both with Marsh and Cope) with the published papers to gain VP. Published papers, therefore, count for all players. It is up to you to make them count the most for yourself.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Hube's Pocket - The Battles for Western Ukraine, January to April 1944, is the fourth game in the Operational Combat Series from The Gamers and depicts the campaign in the Western Ukraine from January to April, 1944. It pits Manstein&rsquo;s Army Group South against the 1st and 2nd Ukrainian Fronts in three encirclement battles&mdash;Kirovograd, Korsun, and Kamenets-Podoliskiy. Both sides confront difficult strategic and tactical problems. The still potent German army holds a vulnerable position. Poor logistics hampers the maturing Red Army.&#10;&#10;However, the game attempts to portray the logistical weakness of the Red Army at this time in the war, and make it a challenge for the Soviet player to keep the Germans encircled or even just on the run. The game also attempts to portray Hitler's &quot;no retreat&quot; mandate (via the victory conditions), and thus limit the German player's ability to conduct a mobile defense.&#10;&#10;Contains &quot;series rules&quot; shared by every game in the series and game-specific rules unique to itself.&#10;&#10;OCS games emphasize supply management and mobility as primary aspects of operational combat (i.e. at the unit scale of battalion/regiment/division) in WWII.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Turn: 1/2 week&#10;Hex: 5 miles / 8 Km&#10;Units: Battalion to Division&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;Two 22 x 34&quot; full-color mapsheets&#10;Six dual-side printed countersheets (4 combat, 2 markers - 1,540 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 40-page OCS version 2.0i rules booklet&#10;One 24-page Hube's Pocket specific rules booklet&#10;Two 4-sided OCS v2.0i Charts &amp; Tables booklets&#10;Two 6-sided dice&#10;&#10;Complexity: High&#10;Solitaire Suitability: High&#10;Players: 1 or more&#10;Playing Time: 10-100 Hours&#10;&#10;",

The city of Black Hills is right in the middle of this struggle, and a tough mayor is needed to put things in their place.&#10;&#10;Black Hills is a resource management game for 2-4 players in which they need to accumulate resources to exchange them for status points. The first player to obtain five status points is appointed as the brand new mayor of Black Hills and wins.&#10;&#10;The game has three different resources: wood, gold pieces and leather. In every round, each player chooses two character cards from the four cards they receive. There are 16 character cards between cowboys, settlers and indians; each character has its own ability and should be placed in one of four locations: woods, plains, city or the jail. Depending on the character and the locations, players acquire different resources or can invest their previously amassed goods in the city in exchange for status points.&#10;&#10;The second deck of cards is the deck of the events. Every player can buy an event for the price of one gold piece and use it whenever they want. The events affect the regular development of the game, granting extra status points, closing locations, or forcing the rest of the players to lose some of their resources.&#10;&#10;Don't want to invest your gold in event cards? Are you a more aggressive kind of player? Do you hate to manage resources? Keep calm because this is the Wild West and what would it be without some hired gunmen? In Black Hills, you can also use your money to hire a gunman to try to steal all the resources from your fellow players.&#10;&#10;So what are you waiting for? Come to the city of Black Hill and find your luck, but watch out because you could end up with nothing in your pockets or a bullet in your head!&#10;&#10;",

Do well and minstrels will sing about your deeds for generations. Do badly, and you will not even have your name scrawled on the privy wall. It is time for your mighty deeds to be chronicled on your Dragonscroll.&quot;&#10;&#10;In Dragonscroll, players take on the role of young dragons, each trying to become the most infamous in the land. Each player has a number of Dragonscroll cards, containing tasks to increase their renown and add to their story.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player draws and places a tile, which is added to the known world. These tiles may reveal enemies, such as wizards, elves and orcs; villages; or even lost royalty, optimistically eager for a lift home. The player then flies to a new location before raining fireballs down on any unsuspecting foes, using the flaming tower of death to determine where they land. At any point during his turn, he also has one bonus action, chosen from one of three double-sided cards. After choosing a bonus, the card is turned over, showing a different bonus action. A player may also eat three creatures to increase the number of fireballs he shoots.&#10;&#10;If a dragon manages to complete a task from one of his Dragonscroll cards, he may add it to his story. The dragon with the most illustrious story at the end of the game wins, and his tale will be recorded as Dragonscroll.&#10;&#10;Dragonscroll includes four dragon models and five buildings as the trademark large-scale Fragor components, in addition to wooden fireballs, wizard meeples, goat meeples, 64 large terrain tiles, 60 cards, and &quot;a fireball flaming tower of death&quot;, dubbed the &quot;Ball-ROG&quot; by co-designer Gordon Lamont.&#10;&#10;",

The Hydra&rsquo;s ultimate goal is to eradicate the last survivors of their ancient nemesis, the Ghin, an alien race that has taken refuge on Earth. Humanity is caught in the apocalyptic crossfire. As widespread panic grips the populace, governments topple, economies crumble, and order dissolves. In these desperate days, mankind&rsquo;s only hope lies with the Ghin and one of their most brilliant minds: Dr. Cronos, a being as guilty of atrocities against humanity as those who hunt him.&#10;&#10;LEVEL 7 [INVASION] is a standalone semi-cooperative game of global strategy set in the LEVEL 7 universe that follows the events of LEVEL 7 [ESCAPE], LEVEL 7 [ESCAPE]: Lockdown, and LEVEL 7 [OMEGA PROTOCOL].

You and your allies must manage your resources carefully to combat the threats of hysteria, famine, and population loss as well. Endure long enough, and you might buy the time for Dr. Cronos to develop the advanced weaponry required to defeat the invading Hydra.

That is a delusion. All I can do is provide you with cardboard pieces and a paper map, and instructions on what to do with them, and maybe some words of historical commentary. Can you feel the confusion and chaos, the reports, false and true, that filled British Headquarters when the counterattack hit ? Can you think what it was like to see the ranks of feldgrau figures appear two hundred yards away, peering through the fogged eyepiece of a gas mask into the back sight of a Lee-Enfield rifle ? I cannot tell you what was in the minds and souls of men who fought the battle. I'm no artist. I design wargames&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Through the mud and the blood to the green fields beyond.&quot; This quote, attributed to Brigadier General Hugh Elles, who led the Tank Corps into action at Cambrai, succinctly states the British objective-to penetrate the German trenches and break into their rear areas. The idea of a breakthrough to the green fields beyond had dominated Allied thinking since 1915. Cambrai was to be as close as they were to come before the final breakthrough of 1918.&#10;&#10;To the Green Fields Beyond is an operational level simulation of the Battle of Cambrai which lasted from 20 November to 7 December, 1917. There are two players, one commanding the British and the other the German forces. The game consists of three scenarios and a campaign game. The players should start with a scenario- the British Breakthrough is best- before attempting the full 17 turns of the campaign game. Players should note that each game turn in To the Green Fields Beyond requires many decisions, and will probably take between 30 and 75 minutes to play.&#10;&#10;To the Green Fields Beyond is uncommon amongst games in that both players get the opportunity to take the offensive. The campaign game provides opportunities for both sides to attack. The British Breakthrough and Battle for Bourlon scenarios have the British attacking, while the German Counterattack scenario obviously has them as defenders, although they can still often mount attacks as well.&#10;&#10;Each hex on the mapsheet represents 1250 yards from side to side. Each Game Turn is equivalent to 24 hours.&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;Rules booklet&#10;400 Die cut counters&#10;1 34&quot; x 22&quot; Map&#10;1 Die&#10;&#10;",

If two face-up cards are identical, those players must make a grab for the totem in the center of the table. The faster player then gives his face-up cards to his unfortunate adversary. To add to the difficulty, certain cards are almost identical, which can trick a hapless player into grabbing the totem by mistake. Whoops! Mess up like this, and you must take the face-up cards of all opponents. Other cards force all players to grab for the totem at once or otherwise change game play.&#10;&#10;Jungle Speed: Rabbids adds a few twists to the basic Jungle Speed game, starting with a &quot;Raving Rabbids&quot; character that sits atop the token. If a player grabs this Rabbid &ndash; even when someone grabs the totem by mistake &ndash; she can give a card from her face-down stack to the player of her choice. Other cards have players race to create rabbit ears on their head or grab the Rabbid without knocking over the totem. Another special card forces everyone but the active player to close their eyes, while the active player moves the totem to some point on the table within reach of everyone; the other players (with eyes still closed) then race to find the totem first using only their hands.

American infantry, armor and paratroopers initially gave way, but rallied, held, and drove the Germans back.&#10;&#10;The game includes 51 scenarios, ranging in size from small ones playable in well under an hour to large tank battles.

The board shows a number of dig sites, with paths of different lengths connecting the sites. To start the game, you place a number of discovery tiles on each site equal to the number of paths leading to it. The tiles show one of five types of artifacts, with 1-5 artifacts on a tile. Each player has his own deck of cards, and the card you draw each turn determines how many archaeologists (1-3) you place on one empty space on any path. When a path fills, the player with the most archaeologists on the path collects one tile from one of the adjacent dig sites &ndash; but in each site he may choose only the tile with the fewest artifacts; the player with the second most artifacts takes the tile that the first player didn&rsquo;t. As the dig sites empty, the more valuable tiles can be claimed.&#10;&#10;The game ends after all five tiles with five artifacts on them have been claimed. Each player was dealt a secret card at the start of the game representing one of the types of artifacts, and players must now discard the tile of that type that contains the most artifacts.

Equip and upgrade your mining machines, then guide them to the rich mineral seams beneath the ocean. Control the supply of resources to bend the market to your will. Become the master of Nautilus Industries!&#10;&#10;In the game, players take on the role of an enterprising business owner, with each trying to exploit the riches of the sea as well as the marketplace to earn the most money by the end of the game. Players take a series of simple actions, such as programming a mining robot, increasing warehouse capacity, swapping mining zone order, or purchasing stocks.&#10;&#10;Each round, players have three actions they must take before the market phase. During this phase, players collect and sell resources, in turn order. Each sea zone is mined in a specific order, and players have the option each round to sell or hold their resources for a later round. When resources are sold, the market price of that resource decreases to reflect the supply/demand of that resource; stocks of the company using that resource also increase in value. Accordingly, if a resource is not sold, the market price for that resource increases. Players must decide when to sell and when to hold. Should you flood the market to bring down the price so your neighbor makes less money? Do you think the player beside you will hold out for a higher price, or will they sell just to spite you?&#10;&#10;Nautilus Industries is easy to learn because of the simple actions you take, yet dynamic because of the way the markets, stocks, and players affect the gameplay.&#10;&#10;",

Players then see what the opponent chose before assembling a deck of ten out of 22 cards, with the players choosing cards both to take advantage of their own megami powers and to exploit their opponent's weaknesses. Players then duel to see who will be victorious.&#10;&#10;The game uses a single kind of token to represent life, distance, aura (defense), and flare (special/gauge). The tokens represent this based on the zone they occupy, by moving tokens between zones you attempt to gain the ideal position and set up to use as many attacks as possible, or be prepared to avoid attacks.&#10;&#10;The gameplay at its core is simple, and due to its limited environment, it is relatively easy to learn the cards for a deck-construction game.

Three different game modes allow players to scale the difficulty of their game by facing more or fewer events &mdash; situations that extract a heavy toll on villains until they are resolved the only way villains know how. Specialty cards add to each villain's ability, making them even more formidable as more specialty cards are played.&#10;&#10;In Marvel Villainous: Twisted Ambitions, players can forge their own twisted paths to victory as Doctor Octopus, Titania, and Kang the Conqueror. To win as Doctor Octopus, players must complete five schemes, such as defeating Spider-Man or amassing and paying power. Those who pick Titania will need to gain strength to become empowered and defeat She-Hulk. Finally, Kang the Conqueror will require players to unleash variants of Kang into other villains' decks and conquer four locations in other villain domains with robot duplicates.&#10;&#10;Each of the characters in Marvel Villainous: Twisted Ambitions can be played on their own or be mixed and matched with villains from previous Marvel Villainous releases.&#10;&#10;",

Players in the game of Eons take on the roles of universal architects competing to shape the universe on a cosmic scale by gathering elemental building blocks to create stars, planets, and other cosmic phenomenon.  In a strategy game like no other, the architects engage the laws of the cosmos, using stars to forge more complex elements and form other heavenly bodies.&#10;&#10;In EONS, players must spend their own essence to marshal these elements, carefully gauging their resources and the benefits received from their planets and stars, as they guide the formation of their cosmos eon after eon; working to achieve the most victory points through a variety of strategies and hidden agendas to achieve their version of the universe.  Because eventually, the universe will end, and only one player will be victorious...&#10;&#10;Players build stars using elements commonly found in the universe, Hydrogen, Carbon, Oxygen and Iron.  Once they build stars, the stars perform fusion, and can produce resources for the player to use to build additional stars, planets or other cosmic events.  Each cosmic body the player builds is worth Essence, representing the power and influence the Architect has in the universe, and that Essence can be used to purchase more elements from the elemental stockpile to build more items.  Players can also destroy stars and collect resources from the dead stars, and this is where the game turns to strategy and planning.  Every cosmic body that is destroyed will decrease the entropy countdown, and when it reaches 0, the game is over.&#10;&#10;Remaining cosmic bodies that grant victory points are totaled, and the player with the most victory points, wins!  Although the goal is to have the most victory points at the end of the game, you will find that the game is also a resource management game, as if you deny resources that stars need to undergo fusion, they will die and accelerate endgame.  Be prepared, build judiciously and destroy when you must to defend your universe!&#10;&#10;",

In the years before the rebellion, the demands for greater power for elected officials and for recognition of the Canadians' rights were at the heart of an ideological struggle between the Patriotes and a coalition loyal to the system in place under the British crown.&#10;&#10;&quot;Prelude to Rebellion&quot; depicts this conflict as a card-driven game using key events from 1834 to 1837.  Each player strives to mobilize the people of the various counties of Lower Canada and rally them to his point of view.&#10;&#10;Relive the history of the famous characters who shaped the province of Quebec in a strategic duel where each turn will bring plenty of unique tension and excitement!&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Flashpoint: Golan is a game about a possible fifth Arab-Israeli war. It uses a highly interactive sequence of play. The map contains the Golan Heights and the surrounding area. The major combatants are; Israel, Syria and Jordan with possible intervention by US or Soviet Union forces.&#10;&#10;Catalogue Description.&#10;The Middle East Is home to some of the largest, most heavily-armed, and politically influential military forces on the planet- and is also a seething mass of national, religious and ethnic animosities, where conflict Is always likely, and likely to command international attention (and involvement). This simulation lets you explore the most likely of these hypothetical conflicts, a fifth Arab-Israeli war, on Israel's northern and eastern borders. Parameters of the conflict are determined by the Scenario Generation System in a random, yet logical, fashion; a scenario will thus rarely start under the same conditions as one already played. Two conventional, set-piece Campaign scenarios are also provided, while five Battle scenarios act as an introduction to the game system. FLASHPOINT: GOLAN accurately depicts the intense, rapid pace of modern air-land warfare with a highly interactive sequence of play wherein each enemy move or action can be detected and immediately reacted to. A medium-complexity game with moderate solitaire suitability, this game features 780 counters representing regiments, brigades and battalion size units; two 22x32&quot; full-color mapsheets; rules and playing aids.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "NFL Strategy is a football game based on plays and the ability to execute them rather than on team statistics. The number of offensive plays and defensive plays varies with each edition and one special teams card are included. Each player secretly chooses his play. The defensive play (which has clear &quot;windows&quot; on it)is played on top of the offensive play to reveal five possible outcomes of the play. To find the result you roll two six sided dice and add them together. The dice roll determines which &quot;window&quot; the players look at and this is the result of the play. The result also takes into account whether the ball is on the left hash mark, the right hash mark or in the center of the field. Earlier versions of this game used a spring loaded bead that you flipped to determine which &quot;window&quot; to look at.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "You have been robbed and left for dead in the middle of nowhere. Without proper clothes or equipment, you must reach the civilized village before you die from hunger, thirst or exhaustion. But there are wild animals lurking, mountains blocking the way, and a wide variety of unpleasant diseases waiting to invade your body. When you think it cannot possibly get any worse, you feel a taunting raindrop on your cheek&hellip;&#10;&#10;In Wilderness, 2 to 8 players race to the nearest civilized village &ndash; but the village is not near, and the way there is not paved. You will have to find water, search for food, avoid wolves, bears and snakes, endure sicknesses and keep your strength up to be able to get there.&#10;&#10;Each player's health is tracked with three parameters: thirst, hunger and exhaustion. Every turn you get more thirsty and hungry and exhausted. The thirstier and hungrier you are, the more exhausted you become, and that determines how much energy you will have each turn. If the exhaustion hits the bottom, you die. The energy is used to walk, but also to search for food or rest. To regain your strength (reduce your exhaustion) you also have to sleep. One of the biggest risks is encountering a predator since they attack you with two dice and you defend with only one and increase exhaustion equal to the difference. And they can scent you from a mile away...&#10;&#10;The game board is discovered gradually as players progress across it, and there are six turns each day (four day turns, two night turns). Each day has different special rules and each landscape tile has its own challenges. Each landscape tile has 21 hexagonal areas in a big triangle and each area has a terrain type such as mountain, wood, swamp and so on, and the tile may also include a predator lair. Different terrain types have their benefits and challenges. The combination and orientation of different landscape tiles make the way forward uncertain and new every game. To top it off, the players have a limited supply of cards that can be played to help yourself or thwart your opponent in certain situations.&#10;&#10;Besides the normal six-tile board, the game can be played in an easy, short version by having only four landscape tiles, or it can be played in a challenging long version by including all eight available landscape tiles.&#10;&#10;The hand-made edition of Wilderness sold out at Spiel 2011. FryxGames is releasing a professionally published version in the first half of 2012, and this version will have improved game play and graphics. For example, search for food has replaced hunting. It is not very likely that you have the equipment you need to hunt. Instead, food will be slightly easier to find but will not fill your stomach as much as before.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Roll the dice, and quickly be the first to identify the right animal!  First, make sure you're looking for the right number from the two yellow dice.  Second, look at the animal dice and find that number of animals among all of them.  Are there more than one animal that match that number?  Then call the third animal!  If nothing matches the numbers, then call &quot;Nothing&quot;!  Call the correct animal, and you win a token for that animal, but be careful not to call the wrong animal, because if you do, then you lose all tokens for that animal.  Whoever is the first to collect two tokens for each animal wins the game!&#10;&#10;If the standard game isn't challenging enough for you, throw in the poacher dice to eliminate certain animals from the call.  If that STILL isn't enough, then include the ranger die (included in the second, boxed edition of the game), which interacts with the poacher dice to further challenge your brain.&#10;&#10;",
