Somehow, it seems everything is connected.&#10;&#10;Each turn, the active player opens the access to a new chamber by manipulating the complex mechanisms from the chamber they are in. That player must choose a card from their hand, which will appear in the tomb, and moves their explorer to try to get treasures.&#10;&#10;Players must place a card partially over 1 or 2 cards on the table. The deity of the played card must be able to beat at least one of the other deities from the cards it&rsquo;s touching. If the new card is placed over 2 cards with the same symbol, win 1 treasure.&#10;&#10;Then, move the Explorer pawn as many times as the played card indicates.

    "description": "Guards! Guards! A Discworld Boardgame sees players taking on the role of newly recruited members of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch. With the Eight Great Spells missing from the Unseen University, the future of the Disc hangs in the balance. Each player is tasked with collecting and returning a number of the spells to the university before it is too late. Each player selects one of four Guilds to infiltrate: Thieves, Assassins, Alchemists or Fools. Their chosen Guild Card will give them a specific selection of the Great Spells to collect and grants them a unique Guild Ability which can be used to hinder their opponents. It is also used to mark the players Charm, Guild and Magic abilities, which can be developed throughout the game.&#10;&#10;There are twelve locations on the board where players may charm (or bribe) volunteers to join them on their quest.&#10;The characters are split into three Volunteer Decks each representing the range of inhabitants who might be found in different locations within the city: Lords &amp; Ladies, Man &amp; Beast and Shades &amp; Shadows. Each Volunteer is assigned a set of skill attributes which can be used individually to protect the Spells, or combined with those of other volunteers and used to complete the Wizards Challenges - five tests of strength, brain, and worthiness which the runners must complete in order to enter the Unseen University with the Spells. A selection of enchanted scrolls, weapons, armour and magical items can be purchased by players to equip their volunteers and boost their attributes.&#10;&#10;A number of volunteer cards carry the &quot;Mark of the Brethren&quot;, the name of a secret society which aims to summon a greater dragon to the city in a plan to overthrow the powers that be in Ankh-Morpork. If a player holds three of these cards at any time, he may choose to call a dragon to a specific city quadrant. This effectively shuts down that area of the city until the dragon is driven off. (Handy if spells are located there that your opponents need.) Opposing players may choose to face the dragon individually or to co-operate with other players and send a combined squad of volunteers to see off the beast. (Dragons may also be called to the city automatically during the game on the turn of a fate card. If this happens, all players must send at least one volunteer to face it.) Members of the Brethren may also be secretly planted in city quadrants to operate as saboteurs.&#10;&#10;When a player feels has recruited the right volunteers, he moves to collect and return the first required Spell (as marked on his Guild Card). You can send up to four volunteers on a Spell Run. Opponents may use magic, or Saboteurs if they have one in play, to try to stop a spell run. If all (or any) of your runners make it to the Unseen University, they must attempt one of the Wizards Challenges (resolved by totalling a specific attribute score of the successful runners, with any bonuses gained from items or magic and a dice roll). If successful they have returned the Spell. The volunteers used are seen to have fulfilled their duty and are discarded. The player then goes on toward his next spell (recruiting new volunteers along the way). The winner is the first to return the five Great Spells shown on his Guild Card. Being set in Ankh-Morpork, many other random hazards face players, but we don't want to spoil the surprise and tell you everything! Where's the fun in that?&#10;&#10;",

Fortunately for them, children always find unexpected allies and manage to escape her. Will you prove as fortunate?&#10;&#10;In Baba Yaga, you need to escape the claws of the hideous Baba Yaga. To do so, however, you need to collect the ingredients for your three spell cards, and to do that you need to search the forest while Baba Yaga searches for you.&#10;&#10;To set up the game, place nine Baba Yaga tiles in a cross to form a flight path, then place the 16 ingredient tokens face down, with four tokens in each section of the cross. Each player starts the game with three spell cards, which must remain hidden. On a turn, the active player reveals her top spell card, which shows four ingredients, then starts searching for these ingredients in the forest, turning over tiles one by one with a single hand and hiding those she doesn't need. While she does this, the other players take turns moving the Baba Yaga figurine one step at a time along one branch of the flight path, then back. If Baba Yaga completes a circuit before the player finds the ingredients, she must place her spell card on the bottom of her stack; if she finds the ingredients, however, she gets to cast the spell on the card, lengthening or shortening the flight path, swapping the location of ingredients, requiring fewer ingredients next time, forcing an opponent to play in a distorted position, and so on. The first player to complete her three spells wins!&#10;&#10;Baba Yaga includes variants for younger players, more experienced players, and those who want the chicken-legged house to be constantly on the move. In the two-player game, the single opponent does all the moving of Baba Yaga, but must swap hands with each move, keeping the inactive hand on her head.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Altaria is an island drifting in space that can be accessed through portals from different dimensions. Three enormous altars situated on the island give power over all dimensions to those who take control of them.&#10;&#10;In Altaria: Clash of Dimensions, each player uses three of ten characters to try to capture all of the altars placed in the center of the game board or the portal that belongs to her opponent. The game consists of seven rounds, and each round is divided into three stages. In each stage, a player gets action points (APs) that are used for the skills of one character. With the help of these APs a player can relocate the character, attack the enemy, or place a unique token of power on the board. Each token can change the course of events in the game.&#10;&#10;The modular board has removable components that provide players with a number of starting combinations and make it possible to play a unique game from the very start.&#10;&#10;An interesting feature used in Altaria is the passing of the tokens of power. After a few stages of the game, they disappear from the board which makes the game more dynamic and constantly changes the situation on the board. Try to make the most of the skills of your characters, outwit your opponent, and be a better tactician.&#10;&#10;",

Players out-maneuver and out-bluff one another so as to gain the riches of the region, while making sure they spend enough of the &quot;oil/money&quot; to ensure the safety of their state. The tension is kept up by secret deployment of forces and the continual angst of balancing resource spending with the saving necessary to come off the winner. It is, usually, the richest player, the one who has probably spent least on 'defense' throughout the game that will come off the victor. But, the twist is that the game can end in war or peace, and there are different victory conditions depending on which of the two outcomes it ends in. A very hard balance to maintain.&#10;&#10;",

On certain spaces, a player has the opportunity to buy or sell Status Cards.  He may also risk a Status Card on a roll of the dice in an effort to upgrade to a more expensive card.  News cards add additional random events, such as gaining or losing Status Cards.  To win, you must declare on Labor Day that you are &quot;going for it&quot;.  By the following Labor Day, you must have at least 3 differently valued Status Cards in each of the four categories to win.&#10;&#10;",

Because if the prediction displeases His Majesty, your own future may not look too bright...&#10;&#10;In Oraklos, players predict the future by throwing many-colored dice onto the table. By gazing at the resulting pattern, they simultaneously try to find elements of the prediction Alexander wants to hear. The fastest sweet talking soothsayer wins the game.&#10;&#10;Apart from the standard game, Oraklos contains 2 variants. Oraklos Junior, an easy variant, is suited for children from 6 years onwards and children will often beat the adults! Antipodes is a more difficult game, suitable for players from 10 years onwards. All variants take about 15 minutes.&#10;&#10;The playing material consists of 70 wish cards, 54 dice, 3 audience tokens, a measuring cord and rules in English, Dutch and German.&#10;&#10;",

Each player starts with $20,000 and a hand of 4 cards, each with a word (&quot;Lethargy&quot;) and four other numbered words (&quot;1. potency, 2. mutability, 3. felicity, 4. vigor&quot;).  In the middle of the board are 4 numbered spaces, 1-4.  At some spaces on the board you are allowed to play antonyms, others synonyms.  You may play up to 4 cards with the proper type to an unfilled number space equal to the number of the appropriate word.  For example on the above card, 4. vigor is an antonym for lethargy and could be played in the #4 spot on the board if empty and you are on a &quot;play antonym&quot; space.  If on your turn you fill the 4th space you &quot;publish a book&quot; and clear all the spaces.  If a player plays all 4 cards from his hand in a turn he also &quot;publishes a book&quot;.  A player may also &quot;publish&quot; a book by passing the start space (&quot;Go&quot;).   If any player feels that a card has been played incorrectly he may challenge the play.  He states what he thinks the correct play is and &quot;bets&quot; $1000.  The playing player may then call or raise in increments of $1000, back and forth until called.  The person who is correct gets the money, and if the challenger is correct the challenged card is returned to the player's hand.  At the end of a player's turn he fills his hand back to 4 cards.  Other spaces on the board require a player to pay money, allow him to collect money, or require all players to pass cards from their hands to other players.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Star of the Guardians is a 2-player Collectible Card Game in which the players play cards to deploy spaceships and destroy each other's empire.  The game is set in a science-fiction setting of the same name, novelized in a 4-book series by Margaret Weis.  For the game, players buy (collect) cards to build up their decks, which are shuffled and from which cards are drawn into hands and played.&#10;&#10;Players take on the roles of Warlords and to deploy their navies, they play system cards, which bestow Influence points.  Other cards can then be played if their cost in Influence are met.  Personality cards provide special abilities and personality points, which are required to play certain cards.  Fate, Damage, Artifacts and Tactics cards are played to alter the outcomes of battles fought among the deployed naval ships (Battleships, Carriers, Destroyers, etc) and squadrons of fighters and bombers.&#10;&#10;Star of the Guardians uses a lane-based combat system (Lane-To-Lane&trade;).  Each player's fleet is deployed in five columns (lanes).  The frontline ships bear the brunt of the fight while the ships behind them can give support, depending on their positions and cards played.  When a player's fleet has been destroyed, his or her home system is open to attack.  Any damage done to a player's home system reduces his or her power, and when a player's power has been reduced to zero, he or she loses the game.&#10;&#10;",

Each awful situation has been ranked from 1-100 by a panel of experts based on physical pain, emotional trauma, and long-term psychological impact. This ranking is what we call &quot;The Misery Index&quot;. At the beginning of the game, each player is dealt three situation cards, which they place face up on the table in front for them, ranked by numerical order of The Misery Index. This is called a players' &quot;Misery Lane&quot;. There are three rounds of play:&#10;&#10;&bull; Round 1 &mdash; &quot;Misery Lane&quot;: The player to the right of the first guesser draws a card from the draw pile and reads the situation aloud and shows the illustration, but hides The Misery Index number on the bottom of the card. To win the card, the player must correctly guess where this situation falls in their Misery Lane. If they are correct, they win that card and add it to their Misery Lane.&#10;&#10;&bull; Round 2 &mdash; &quot;More or Less Miserable&quot;: After a player has collected a total of eight cards in their Misery Lane, they have now entered the second round. In this round, the player to the right takes the first three cards from the top of the deck and and reads the descriptions aloud. Now the player must correctly put all three cards in the correct order (from least to worst) by announcing them aloud to the group, without seeing their Misery Index number. If they are incorrect, play continues to the left and they will have another chance with three more cards on their next turn. If they are correct, they add them to their Misery Lane and progress to Round 3.&#10;&#10;&bull; Round 3 &mdash; &quot;Margin of Misery&quot;: In this final round, the player must guess The Misery Index number within 10 points. The player to the right draws a card and reads the situation aloud. The player now must correctly guess a 10-point range that this card falls into. For example, if it is a Misery Index number of 82, and the player guesses a range of 75-85, that player wins that card and wins the game!&#10;&#10;Win condition: Be the first player to have 12 cards in their Misery Lane.&#10;&#10;",

The money denominations include $3.00 bills.&#10;&#10;One departure from the original Monopoly is the inclusion of Family Pride cards.  When landing on the appropriate space, the description of a famous gay man is read aloud, and the player who can correctly identify the person can move ahead to any space on the board.  Also different is the addition of Camp Cards.  When these are drawn, you must perform the indicated action (ie. 'say: 'faaabulous!' six different ways and receive $3).  Finally, there are &quot;hanky code&quot; cards, where the player must identify what each color of the code meant, and what it meant when worn in each (left and right) rear pants pocket.&#10;&#10;Rumor has it that there were only a very limited number of copies of this game, as it was produced by The Parker Sisters, a division of Fire Island games, and were sued for copyright infringement by Parker Brothers (the company is no longer in business).&#10;&#10;",

It is not about Washington, DC, but the efforts of the people on the spot, whether that is Claiborne Parish, Louisiana or Mobile, Alabama.&#10;&#10;Free at Last is a card-driven game in which each card has a number (used to activate special individuals) and an event, but uniquely, the color of the number also matters and affects the type of project (voting rights, accommodations, school desegregation) that can be attempted. Multiple-length versions can be played: 3 turns (ending with the Freedom Rides), 6 turns (ending with the March on Washington), or a 9 turn game covering this entire period in American history. Players take turns playing cards from their hand.  These cards let the players take actions to accomplish Projects--examples include working to desegregate schools in New Orleans; Fayette County voter registration; as well as the various Freedom Rides across the south.  They also can be used for a specific event on the card, granting special powers to the players--but also potentially creating future disadvantageous consequences or making cooperation between the players' groups more difficult.&#10;&#10;While the game will eventually mean one organization/player 'wins', players must work together; if projects fail and are suppressed by the segregationists, then the Civil Rights Movement falls apart.  Thus, Free at Last is cooperative AND competitive.&#10;&#10;Note: This game bears the same name and designer as Free at Last, but the designs each stand on their own, with this game being for 2-6 players while the previous game was for only two players.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "In Challenge Football players are taking the role of coaches in an &quot;American&quot; Football game. As coaches, each is deciding what plays to run in order to win the game.&#10;&#10;Plays commences with the selection of a play card by the defensive player. He/she installs a cover over this card such that the offensive player can only see the players on the line of scrimmage. A &quot;shift&quot; card must also be selected that gives the option of shifting the defensive line to either side for the play.&#10;&#10;The offensive player receives the play card and cover and must draw the offensive play on top of the clear holder. This could be a combination of runs, handoffs and passes.&#10;&#10;With the plays determined, the cover is removed, the shift card revealed and the path of the play is compared to the defensive positions. Where the path crosses a triangle is where the ball is downed. A touchdown is scored when a play is not downed on the field. Players are also attempting to make ten yards in four downs, as in football, to earn a first down.&#10;&#10;Random events include a roll every play to see if there is a penalty, and dice-rolling punting, kick off and field goal rules.&#10;&#10;After four quarters of fifteen plays each, the winner is the player with the most points.&#10;&#10;3M Bookshelf Series.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Le Jeu Du Nain Jaune (Game of the Yellow Dwarf) is an attractive and unique traditional French card game that strikes a satisfying balance between luck of the draw and genuine strategy. Quality sets comprise wooden trays inlaid with the special scoring cards (King Hearts, Queen Spades, Jack Clubs, ten diamonds and the greatest scoring seven of diamonds), plus a conventional 52 card pack and betting tokens (poker chips). Cheaper sets are invariably plastic and can be found in most French supermarkets for a few Euros/dollars.  The objective is to dispose of the cards in your hand, playing them in simple numerical sequence from 1 (Ace) to King, picking up bonuses along the way. The suits have no significance other than when playing the five special cards. The person playing the King terminates the sequence and may restart it with a card of their choice. This is where the strategy comes in. Remembering which cards have been played allows you to frustrate your opponents by starting a sequence favoring the cards remaining in your hand. The simplicity of the basic game appeals to younger gamers, whereas the hardened gambler and his/her gaming friends can enjoy the hunt for the 7 of diamonds tray full of Euros. A good way to learn this game is by downloading shareware versions available on the Internet.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by: Pope Joan&#10;&#10;",

The other player takes the role of the fish and with bluff and skill tries to hinder the anglers from catching fish. The angler player decides where to fish, but must do so in the dark (that is, he cannot really see where the fish are), as the fish cards are placed face down. Because of this, he does not know whether he is catching a fish or garbage. Also, when he is lucky enough to catch a fish, he will not know until he lands it how valuable it is. With clever movement of his fish, the fish player tries to get garbage and small fish onto the anglers hooks.&#10;&#10;After one game, the players switch roles.
