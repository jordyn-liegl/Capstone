    "description": "Players play out a live-action cricket game with miniature figures on a fabric playing field. One player 'bowls' a small ball from a bowler while the other player operates the batsman. Fielders are placed throughout the board to 'catch' the ball in the base between their feet.&#10;&#10;A classic and beloved family game originally released in 1977 and immensely popular in the UK, Australia, India and South Africa in particular. The game has undergone a number of changes and additions over the years, but basically layout and game play has stayed the same.&#10;&#10;In some versions, the Bowler figure has a long tilting 'chute' that the ball rolls down after pushing on the bowlers arm. In others the figure is spring loaded and pressing a lever makes the figure 'throw' the ball, with a setting for fast or slow bowling. The balls themselves have changed from small metal ball bearings to two sizes/weights - for both variety in play and for easier game play for younger players.&#10;The Batsman figure in some editions has a string with which you pull back the bat to release it to hit the ball, others have a slide mechanism and some have a trigger mechanism to move the bat. &#10;The fielding player figures are a variety of colours in different versions and may be white, yellow or blue. Additionally in a couple of versions (like Super Cricket) they had magnetic bases to further help 'field' the ball.  &#10;The player figures in one version (One Day Cricket) came entirely unpainted and could be painted the colours of your favourite teams. Later editions include an actual Wicket Keeper figure rather than a 'W' shape part of the batter mechanism.&#10;&#10;The playing 'field' also has changed shape and fabric. In some editions it is very thin light fabric (and in older games, the flocking on the underside completely disintegrates and moults off!) in others it is thicker, crease resistant neoprene. The boundary 'fence' is either white L shaped angled plastic flat or picket shaped strips with green joiner pieces or in more recent versions, a simple rope length.&#10;&#10;In the different versions players can simulate a one-day international, a Twenty/20 series or a full five-day test match. &#10;As well as being featured on box graphics, some well known cricket players have even lent their names to some versions, like Freddie Truman, Mike Atherton, AB De Villiers &amp; Jonty Rhodes.&#10;&#10;It is very difficult to date many of the earlier games accurately as there are no dates on the boxes (very annoying). The date '1977' on the included rule sheet ACTUALLY refers to the copyright date of the ORIGINAL games release by Peter Pan Playthings and NOT that particular versions release. Guesstimates can be made by the box imagery, design and playing piece inclusions.&#10;&#10;&#10;World Cup Cricket is touted as &quot;The original action-packed table-top cricket game!&quot; for Ages 4 and up.&#10;In the box (decorated with action shots of late 80s / early 90s players including Alec Stewart and Jack Russell) comes with a green beize (?? beige) playing area which is laid out on a table, with six boundary fence sections which Velcro around the edge to act as the boundary and prevent the ball flying off around the room. The batsman attached at one end and the bowler to the other.&#10;&#10;The pitch (although octagonal) resembles an archery target -the closer to the boundary and further from the batsmen, the higher the ring value. Directly in front of the batsmen is an area worth no runs, outside of that 1 run, then a ring worth 2 runs and the outer area worth 3 runs. Hitting the fence gets 4 runs and there are four small areas jutting out of the boundary worth 6 runs.&#10;&#10;The bowling player places fielders (with a catching 'cup' between their legs) around the field in an attempt to 'catch' the batsman out. Bowling is achieved by loading the ball into the bowler's cupped hand and pushing down on the front arm, causing the ball to roll down a ramp towards the batsman.&#10;&#10;The batsman is controlled with cord attached to the bat. The batting player pulls back the cord, releasing it in time to hit the approaching ball. Whichever area the ball is hit to is the number of runs the player gets.&#10;Batsmen can be out by being caught by the bowler, by hitting the ball between the legs of the fielders into their 'cups', by the ball hitting the stumps behind the batsmen or by the batsman edging the ball into the &quot;wicket keeper&quot; which is attached to the batting stand.&#10;&#10;There are earlier versions of the game where the batting action is different and the players less detailed.&#10;&#10;",

He uses his resources to found 7 tribes before the end of the 10th season and thus fight against his inevitable extinction.&#10;&#10;On a hand management mechanic, Mother Nature places the resources and watches over her herds. She chooses the climatic conditions of each season, uses her cards to react to the actions of the tribes and trigger events. All this to prevent Sapiens and Neanderthals from reaching their goal before the end of the 10th season.&#10;&#10;",

These increase the ability to have more players and include all of these great additional cards to the game with hilarious references and images by Randy Martinez.&#10;&#10;Sitting Ducks Gallery is a hysterically fun, stick-it-to-your-neighbor, line manipulation game invented by Keith Meyers. Sitting Ducks is reminiscent of the classic carnival-style, midway shooting galleries, where players are trying to take out as many ducks as possible. Players move ducks and targets, take aim, and eventually eliminate other players&rsquo; ducks using a variety of humorous Action Cards, while trying to keep their own safe.  The goal is to be the last duck in the pond!&#10;&#10;HOW TO PLAY&#10;&#10;In Sitting Ducks, each player gets their own group of ducks. Those ducks are shuffled together and form the Duck Deck, which then become the Duck line.&#10;&#10;The Duck line is always in flux - when a Duck is removed; the other ducks move forward to fill the gap.  Certain cards can move the line forward, backwards or rearrange ducks in the line in your favor or your opponents. With the right cards, players may also move and manipulate targets to try to keep their own Ducks safe.&#10;&#10;Eventually, you&rsquo;ll get caught snoozing and you will surely lose some of your ducks.&#10;&#10;Lose all of your ducks, and you can no longer win the game.  But, one of the most fun aspects of Sitting Ducks is when all of your ducks have been eliminated from the game. Although you won&rsquo;t win, you&rsquo;ll still get a chance to exact revenge on the opponents who took you out and play Action Cards for the rest of the game! The last player to have a duck in the water is the winner!&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Suez '73: The Battle of Chinese Farm: October 15-22, 1973, is a game about the battle that took place the Egyptian Army and the Israel Defense Forces, as part of the Yom Kippur War.&#10;&#10;It was fought in the Sinai Peninsula, north of the Great Bitter Lake and just east of the Suez Canal, near an Egyptian agricultural research station. The farm was using specialized Japanese-made machinery that had Kanji characters on them, so Israeli military maps labeled the area as 'Chinese Farm'.[1][2] The battle began when the IDF launched Operation Abiray-Lev (&quot;Stouthearted Men&quot;), attempting to establish a corridor to the canal and allow bridges to be laid for a crossing. Accordingly, the Israelis attacked Egyptian forces in and around the Chinese Farm.&#10;&#10;Determined Egyptian resistance made progress extremely slow for the Israelis, who suffered heavy losses. The Israelis were repeatedly reinforced with armor but were unable to make much headway, only managing to seize an important crossroad on the second day. Suffering from a lack of infantry, the Israelis brought up paratroopers during the night of October 16/17. They were tasked with clearing anti-tank defenses for the armor, but they became pinned down by heavy Egyptian fire. The paratroopers drew Egyptian attention long enough for the Israelis to move bridging equipment to the canal undetected. Armored forces later extricated the paratroopers.&#10;&#10;The Egyptians attempted to restore their defenses to their initial dispositions with an armored attack on October 17. It initially succeeded, but was pushed back by Israeli counterattacks in an armored battle lasting the entire day. Seriously depleted by the continuous fighting, the Egyptians relinquished control of the routes to the canal, opening them up to the Israelis. The battle is remembered as one of the most costly and brutal battles of the war.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 12 hours&#10;Hex: .9 miles / 1.5 kilometers&#10;Units: Company to Brigade&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 22 x 27&quot; full color map&#10;Two dual-side printed countersheet (480 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 16-page Suez '73 rulebook&#10;One 12-page Suez '73 Historical Notes &amp; Scenario Booklet&#10;Two dual-side printed CRT/TEC players aid cards&#10;One single-side printed Turn Record/Israeli Unit Composition players aid card&#10;One single-side printed Egyptian Unit Composition players aid card&#10;One single-side printed Israeli Order of Battle/Reinforcement schedule players aid card&#10;One single-side printed Egyptian Order of Battle/Reinforcement schedule players aid card&#10;One 6-sided die&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: High&#10;Complexity Level: Medium&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 4-15 hours&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "The City of Heroes Customizable Card Game (COHCCG) was designed by David Williams and produced by Alderac Entertainment Group (AEG). There were a total of two sets of cards released for the game. The first, Arena, was released in January, 2006. The second set, Secret Origins, was released in October, 2006. Since then, there have been no official releases.&#10;&#10;The COHCCG was designed to be a quick game. Rather than using a turn structure where each player takes multiple actions in a row, the game used an alternating action structure. This lead to faster and more interactive games. Each player was represented by a Hero card, which began play with 2 starting powers. As their action, a player had many choices, including:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Play a card, being:&#10;         a Sidekick&#10;         a Power that can be used by the Hero or a Sidekick&#10;         an Enhancement on a Power already in play&#10;         an Edge card with the keyword &quot;Action&quot; or &quot;React&quot;&#10;    &#10;    Activate a Power already in play&#10;    Move the Hero or a Sidekick&#10;    Search your draw deck for a Sidekick&#10;    Recharge your Powers&#10;    Play a Mission card&#10;    Use the Defeat text on a mission to complete it&#10;    Draw 2 cards&#10;&#10;&#10;Unless otherwise specified by the cards played, play continued until only one Hero remained, who was declared the winner.&#10;&#10;In addition to the 33 Heroes available in Arena and the 22 Heroes available in Secret Origins, players could create their own hero using &quot;Paragon&quot; Hero cards. These cards allowed a player to create new combinations of powers that were not available on existing Hero cards. Players could either play solely with the Paragon Hero cards available in the Arena set, or go online to access the HeroBuilder which allowed players to create Hero cards in the same template as the already available Heroes, including a picture uploaded by the player.&#10;&#10;After the game was discontinued, a fan community effort created the Hamidon set.  Although the generic Hero cards listed all power sets available to the archetypes at the time, it wasn't until The Hamidon set was developed that many of those power sets were codified for use.&#10;&#10;",

Three weeks of savage fighting would finally see the island secured, as places like Death Valley, Hell&rsquo;s Pocket and Purple Heart Ridge entered the U.S. Marine Corps&rsquo; lexicon. The campaign saw the largest tank battle of the Pacific war, and also its largest banzai charge as almost the entire Japanese garrison (and much of the island&rsquo;s Japanese civilian population) chose death over surrender.&#10;&#10;Panzer Grenadier: Saipan 1944 is a complete boxed game in the Panzer Grenadier series based on these fearsome battles. Designer Jay Townsend has provided 40 scenarios. There are four new mapboards by artist Guy Riessen showing the jungles, hills, beaches and cane fields of Saipan. And 495 playing pieces: 330 superb die-cut counter combat units and 165 die-cut markers.&#10;&#10;The U.S. Marines have awesome firepower &ndash; every third man wields an automatic rifle &ndash; and bring tanks, flamethrowers and heavy artillery to the battlefield.

The tiles don't have to match every single side, so if we place a tile touching three others but only matching two of the sides, we take those two tiles and leave the rest. We keep aside the tiles that we get from the table as they are our points. The tile that we played stays on the table, and we receive a new one at the end of our turn so that we always have three from which to choose. Whoever gets the most candies wins!&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "This is a reworking of an older Eon game known simply as Hoax.  The new additions include a new character as well as a point system to replace the all-or-nothing nature of accusations.  The basic idea is to pretend to be somebody you are not while working towards the goal of figuring out who other people are. Each player is assigned one of seven different characters -- each with its own unique abilities -- but can pretend to be any character and use its corresponding powers. Abilities are used to acquire three different types of goods, which can be spent to get clues to opponents' identities. If the majority of the other players think you're pretending to be a character that you're not, you must either admit that you are not that character (and permanently lose the use of its power), or reveal that you are and win the game.&#10;&#10;Is a re-implementation of:&#10;&#10;    Hoax&#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Before the civilizations that we know of there was a great island, called by contemporary scientists Atlantis. It was inhabited by a civilization that had extraordinary cultural and technological achievements, especially in architecture and art.&#10;&#10;All that wouldn&rsquo;t have been possible if they hadn&rsquo;t been blessed by the gods, who the Atlants honored by building glorious monuments for them. And the gods didn&rsquo;t mind that they weren&rsquo;t the only ones being cherished by the Atlants. Alas, the plan of the gods was not perfect. Things went awry because of the younger generation of the gods.&#10;&#10;Specifically it was Ares, the son of Zeus and Hera, whose actions resulted in the disaster. His wickedness was endless, and the cruelty of his followers and the destruction they caused initiated civil war in the land that had only known peace. The emerged conflict divided both the Atlants and their deities. Before those events, the gods had taken pleasure in watching their folk grow, but then they started to interfere with the people&rsquo;s affairs as well as fight one another. Some of the old gods had predicted that this civilization would eventually collapse due to the ever growing conflict between the deities. Conflict in which people&rsquo;s lives would mean nothing.&#10;&#10;So, they decided to protect their followers by sending numerous visions to their priests or by taking a human form and acting as prophets. They would warn Atlants that the end was nigh and tell them about distant lands that could be their only hope for survival.&#10;&#10;Rage of the gods kept growing until one day the eldest one, Nammu, the creator of the primeval sea, in her despair decided to end the Atlants&rsquo; suffering by sinking the island. With the help of their gods some of the Atlants managed to survive. They arrived at various parts of the world, bringing their knowledge to the cultures emerging there.&#10;&#10;In Atlantis: Island of Gods players are the highest priests of the mythological gods, for whom they erect monuments on the mythical island of Atlantis right before its doom. It's a logical card game with four boards representing the regions of Atlantis.&#10;&#10;Each turn, players take five actions during which they can recruit new followers of their deity, celebrate feasts in their honor, and build new temples. The goal of the game is to be the first to build all the temples of the player's deity which grants them god's favor and survival of the imminent catastrophe.&#10;&#10;",

Alternatively, if you already have NMBR 9, you can now play the game with up to six players at once.&#10;&#10;NMBR 9 ++ also includes expansion components that you can use with this box or with the original NMBR 9 game or with both combined. You have six different starting tiles, for example, with each player taking one at random before the game begins, which makes it impossible for players to build in the same patterns as one another.&#10;&#10;You can give each player two &quot;gap filler&quot; tiles &mdash; one that is a single square and a second that is two squares long. You can use one or both at any point in the game when you're placing a number tile.&#10;&#10;You can deal out two of the six &quot;rule breaker&quot; cards, then give each player two cubes in a different color. During the game, if you want to use a &quot;rule breaker&quot; card &mdash; e.g., move a tile previously placed, place the current tile upside down, or reserve the tile for placement later &mdash; place one of your cubes on the card, then use its power. You can use each card only once.&#10;&#10;Finally, NMBR 9 ++ includes variant rules that can be used with 1-4 players. In &quot;2 out of 3&quot;, you create a deck of thirty cards (0-9 thrice) and put all of the number tiles on the table. Each round, you reveal three cards one by one. Each player can place the first number tile revealed or refuse it; if they refuse it, they must place the next two number tiles; if they place it, they must refuse one of the next two tiles. In the end, everyone will place twenty number tiles, as in the basic game.&#10;&#10;In &quot;Level to Level&quot;, shuffle all forty cards into a deck, place all number tiles on the table, and lay out new tokens numbered 0-4. For the first two turns, draw a card and placed it under 0; each player must place this number tile in front of them following the usual rules. For the third turn, flip a card into both the 0 slot and 1 slot; the tile showing under 0 can be placed only on the ground level and the tile under 1 can be placed only on the first level. You can refuse to place either or both tiles.&#10;&#10;Once a player has two tiles on the first level, next turn flip a card under slots 0, 1, and 2, with the latter number tile being placed only on the second level. Continue play until the deck runs out or you can't flip enough cards to start a turn.&#10;&#10;",

Players have to use deduction, memory and push their luck to arrange suits of symbols or colours to steal a sapphire.&#10;&#10;Place 16 cards into a 4 x 4 grid face down. &#10;The Sapphire gems are placed into the gaps between the cards.&#10;&#10;Each player turn has four phases; &#10;1: &lsquo;make a hand&rsquo; phase where the player ensures they have a hand of three cards drawn from the pile&#10;2: &lsquo;glimpse&rsquo; phase, when they can peek at a card on the grid without showing others what it is. &#10;3:&lsquo;action&rsquo; phase, where the player can play card  or do action on card from the grid.&#10;4:&lsquo;attempt a steal&rsquo; phase, where the player managed to arrange suites of symbols or colours to steal a sapphire.&#10;&#10;Once all the Sapphire gems from the grid have been taken, the game ends. The one with the most Sapphire gems wins.&#10;&#10;",

The game is for 3 to 5 people and it can be played in 15 minutes.&#10;&#10;One player places a recommendation card on the field.  Depending on the number of votes one of the players will earn the wakomono.  There are also some unique rules, and it also requires strict hand management. Players aim for the highest score, but they should not exceed their master's score. Eventually, if a player's score exceeds his/her master's, the player will be dropped from the game. This mirrors Japanese culture in which one should be &ldquo;polite&rdquo; and not make the master lose face.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Bitskrieg is the game of tiny tank battles. Each player gets a platoon of five tanks and maneuvers on an 8&times;8 grid to destroy their opponent&rsquo;s tanks. Nobody knows why they have it in for each other. Are they fighting over a simple misunderstanding? The last slice of pizza? Arctic water rights? What&rsquo;s important is that they will stop at nothing to destroy each other, except maybe flags. They might stop to sit on some flags.&#10;&#10;Bitskrieg is designed to be simple enough to be played with children or grandchildren, while still providing enough tactical challenge to interest wargaming adults. With fewer than forty counters and a single page of rules, Bitskrieg packs a lot of punch in a tiny package.&#10;&#10;Terrain is arranged randomly on an eight-by-eight square grid, and players choose sides. You choose your force of five tanks from four different types, each with their own strengths and weaknesses: light, medium, and heavy tanks, and tank destroyers. Place your two flags and the battle is on! You win by destroying all enemy tanks or by capturing both enemy flags.&#10;&#10;Play in Bitskrieg alternates with each player activating one tank to move or fire, or using their turn to refresh all their previously-activated tanks. Fire involves simple counting of range and rolling a die to hit, then rolling a die for penetration after a successful hit to destroy the target.&#10;&#10;Optional advanced rules include flanking, ramming, bounding fire, stun, terrain types, and more. Bitskrieg handicaps easily, so if luck is not enough for your young one to turn the tables on you, you can customize the experience to find the right balance.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "In the short summer of the Southern Alps, animals live in a corral. In Peter's Two Sheep Dogs, players act as two sheep dogs, calling the animals with a loud voice and chasing off the wolf. Compete to be Peter's best sheep dog by herding the animals from the grassland, into the fence, and finally to the hut.&#10;&#10;The player aims to become a sheep dog and collect many animals into their navery. Three livestock animals &mdash; sheep, pig, cow &mdash; score points, while the wolf eats the livestock and eliminates points. As a result, players balance moving the wolves to threaten the opponent while also gathering livestock for themselves.&#10;&#10;However, because both trick-taking and mancala rules are mixed together, it will not be easy. Basically winning a trick allows players to collect animals in their grasslands. The player who loses the trick picks one of their grasslands and performs the movement action. If you can chase animals perfectly toward your or your opponent's goal fence, you can gain additional action opportunities and an even better score.&#10;&#10;During the game you have opportunities for scorings in spring and summer, and if the score obtained in summer is lower than the score obtained in spring, the summer score becomes 0 points. However, if the score obtained in summer is more than twice the score of spring, your spring score is doubled.&#10;&#10;",

The player can play a single match, or with multiple games, simulate an entire league season. Many expansion sets of additional leagues and championships are available separately.&#10;&#10;The basic game is simple and short (usually under 5 minutes), only determining if goals have been scored during the match by using the two teams' attack and defense ratings, chance cards, and a die rolls to see if a goal was scored.  Additional rules add the ability to identify scoring players and the time of the goal, and noting injuries and suspensions of players.&#10;&#10;From the publisher's site:&#10;The Beautiful Game has been awarded the TABLETOP GAME OF THE DECADE by Jamie Marshall's 'Sports Digest'&#10;&#10;The game includes the most current English Premier League teams available at time of printing&#10;&#10;Watch a football match, live or on television, enjoy the action, the mid-field struggle,the joy of victory for your team, the despair of defeat, but a few hours after the final whistle what do you remember ? I suspect mainly the dramatic bits, the goals, the great saves, the near misses, the chances scorned. So that's exactly what you get in 'The Beautiful Game', those brief moments that decided the match, for better or worse, the bits that make up your memories, the talking points, the incidents that stay with you at least until next match day.&#10;&#10;'The Beautiful Game' (henceforward 'BG') is an accurate replay game, accurate in results that is, and goal scorers, but unlike most soccer replay games it requires no user-decisions (which will appeal to some but not all) and is fast to play, just four to ten minutes per match, depending on how much you want to know in terms of stats.&#10;&#10;For 'BG' is a layer game, three layers in this case, the basic quick-result is layer one, add on some personality with goal scorers, times of goals, that's layer two, and get involved in some simple book-keeping by recording (generic) bookings and injuries and rewarding winning form, plus adding some 'joining up' commentary, that's layer three. Even with all three layers most matches will take no more than 6-7 minutes, unless it's a real cracker !&#10;&#10;",

Each player controls two prisoners as they make their way through the winding labyrinth of a space prison, trying to collect enough oxygen to survive while denying their opponents the same. The goal is to collect as many points as possible (represented by oxygen tiles of different colors and values), located inside a maze formed by hexagonal tiles. Players must move across the maze and collect the points before their opponents.&#10;&#10;The game has two phases: construction and competition. In the construction phase, players take turns placing tiles and creating the the board (maze). Then the competition phase begins, where players move around the maze attempting to collect more points (oxygen) than their opponents. Where players place their tiles is of utmost strategic importance in the construction phase: Sector 6&acute;s building system allows strategic planning while the maze is being created. In the absence of a predefined configuration, each game takes place on an entirely new board. There are essentially an infinite amount of setup configurations which allows for high replay value.&#10;&#10;But building a good maze and moving quickly will not be enough to achieve victory. During the game, Sector 6's maze will be in constant motion, as players can rotate the tiles, thereby changing the layout of the maze, potentially allowing players to block their opponents or create new pathways to reach the points faster. So it won't be the fastest player who wins, but the one who learns how to best use the intricacies of the maze to their own advantage and to the detriment of their opponents!&#10;&#10;",

Throughout the game, these units are moved around the board &mdash; a 4x4 grid of locations, each with their own effects &mdash; to attack opposing units and score points, while cards are used to manipulate the game a variety of ways.&#10;&#10;The three action cards correspond to the three different unit types &mdash; Infantry, Cavalry, and Engine &mdash; and along with the turn sequence card, they drive the game through round-based game play in which each player in a round receives three turns, but never the same three actions as the other player.&#10;&#10;Players score points for destroying an opposing unit, playing two or more cards during their turn, having both units survive the round, and controlling the vast inland Sawgrass Sea. The game ends when a player has scored 12 or more points at the end of the round, with the player who scores the most points winning.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The game was created by Jim Barnes who sold the game at a booth that he set up at Indy and other race track promenades in the 1970s. Mr. Barnes struck a deal with Avalon Hill and the game was changed a little by the development team at AH and published with the SI logo on the box.  On an oval track you can run up to 33 cars. Each car has its own driver card derived from the performance of the actual drivers of the featured Indy race. Ongais, Foyt, Unser, Sneva, Mears, Rutherford etc, every driver that was in the that year's Indy has a card with a color photo on one side and game racing charts on the other side.  One Card set, for an even year Indy race from 1978 through 1986, was included in the box with the other card sets offered through the AH mail order program.&#10;&#10;Each driver card has 6 tables on the back. Three of the tables for movement, you chose whether you are going to drive normally, charge or back off and then roll 2 dice, referencing the appropriate table. The result will tell you how far you can move or if you have encountered car trouble. There are 2 trouble tables that can slow you down or knock you out of the race. There is also a pit stop table which controls how many turns you must sit in the pits before re-entering the race.&#10;&#10;The game is driven on Stats and can be played solitaire.&#10;&#10;",

Everything is going so fast!&#10;&#10;Safari Splash! is a game for 2-6 players of ages 8+, that plays in just 90 seconds. At the beginning of the game each player gets a reminder card and a scoring card (there are 4 different levels of scoring, of increasing complexity). The 120 safari cards are randomized and placed face down in a disorganized pile, within the reach of all players.&#10;&#10;The scoring card serves as the starting point of each player's river, and also depicts the preferred (and maybe disliked) animal(s) for the player. The game is played in real time (it counts with an app support) and players will be taking face down cards from the safari pile, flipping them over, and adding them to their river. The deal is that each safari card back depicts 3 animals, but only 2 of them are present on the card front. So players need to select the safari cards carefully, and then place them in their area so that they form a continuous river.&#10;&#10;When a player takes and flips a card containing a whirlpool, they shout &quot;SPLASH!&quot; and each player gives the safari card they're holding to the player to their left.&#10;&#10;Once the time is up, players verify the integrity of their river, and then count points according to their scoring card. The player with the most points makes a big splash and wins the game!&#10;&#10;Safari Splash! has different sets of victory conditions so it is playable by a wide range of ages.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "A game about an encounter battle of gargantuan proportions in north Italy...&#10;&#10;On a brutally hot day in June 1859, on the 24th, three armies clashed. The French, under the command of Napoleon III, the Piedmontese under Victor Emmanuel II and the Austrians under Franz Josef (the famous husband of the Empress Sisi!). A quarter of a million men. &#10;The largest battle on European soil since Waterloo.&#10;Each of them unaware of the enemy&rsquo;s positions, that they all expected to be further away, the three armies were to fight an encounter battle of gargantuan proportions.  &#10;The battle took place on three fronts. In the north, between the Piedmontese and the talented Benedek&rsquo;s VIIIth Corps; in the centre around the village of Solferino, place of terrible, bloody, hand to hand fighting; and in the south, on the plains of Medole and Guidizzolo, where the French would try in vain to turn the Austrians&rsquo; left wing. &#10;Broken off by a storm of a rare intensity, the battle was to end in a gigantic human tragedy. Europe had not seen as much bloodshed for more than 40 years. 30,000 dead and wounded, 10,000 missing or prisoners of war, another 40,000 sick after the battle due to the makeshift hygienic conditions and lack of provisions.&#10;&#10;This game has already been published by the excellent (even if French too...) Vae Victis. This is a reworked and rewritten version, designed for easier play.  Thanks to the topographical talents of Riccardo Rinaldi, the map is an accurate and realistic representation of the historical battlefield. The game system uses a simple table to achieve morale results for fire combat and assault, where units are tested against their morale/cohesion value. The sequence of play with defensive fire during an assault is the standard solution for 19th century battles, and here it works! &#10;The game has high replayability value with many interesting nuances, which we hope you will experience. Playing time for a game is between 3 and 5 hours. And, without spoiling anything in &#10;the game, it also plays very well solitaire.&#10;&#10;Scale - Turn: 1 hour . Hexagon: 600 meters.

One player commands the French forces, the other the Austrians. The map is an accurate representation of the battlefield, the counters represent the forces which took part, and rules on movement, combat, leadership and morale reflect the problems and possibilities which faced the historical commanders.&#10;&#10;The scale of the combat is that one strength point represent 200 infantry, 150 cavalry or 2 guns, each turn is 35 minutes; each hex is 600 yards. Victory is determined my control of objective hexes and loss inflicted on the enemy.&#10;&#10;Note:&#10;Eckmuhl is a complete game in itself. It can also be played as a &ldquo;campaign game&rdquo; linked with another of 3W&rsquo;s Bonaparte series, The Battle of Abensberg (in S&amp;T #113). Eckmuhl was fought on the two days following Abensberg, in the area immediately to the north. Many of the same units participated, along with many others. Two scenarios were provided with Abensberg; four are provided with Eckmuhl. A further dozen scenarios will be found in The Wargamer #3 and S&amp;T #115 (Kanev). These later scenarios link the two games.&#10;&#10;Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #116 adds two more scenarios and a Q&amp;A by the designer.&#10;&#10;",

To prevent this, the gods send fate weavers to change the past and prevent death. In the game series UNDO, players slip into the role of these destiny weavers and do everything in their power to undo sudden deaths &mdash; whether murder or suicide. Not only do they travel minutes or hours back in time, but sometimes thousands of years to change events that have laid the foundation for the later stroke of fate. Sometimes a leap into the future can also provide important information.&#10;&#10;The UNDO series combines the theme of time travel with emotional, extraordinary stories that players must assemble piece by piece. Each time jump gives them another choice in how they can change the past &mdash; and not every change is a turn for the better!&#10;&#10;In UNDO: Forbidden Knowledge, tragedy strikes on a graveyard in a swamp, in 1923&rsquo;s City of Arkham: A man, standing by an open crypt, realizes the existence of something so terrifying that, in shock, he suffers an immediate cardiac arrest.

If Time or your Stamina runs out, the heiress is murdered and you lose the game and the Case.&#10;&#10;Needed to Play: &#10;The deck of 36 cards&#10;4 YELLOW Investigate Dice&#10;1 RED Paperboy Die&#10;1 GRAY Underworld Connection Die&#10;8 wooden cubes&#10;&#10;Game Phases:&#10;1. Storyline - Move the cube on the Time card down one hour and draw the top 3 cards of the Investigate deck. Do not look at their front sides. Choose 1 and place it face up in front of you (this is the current Storyline card); a 2nd card is placed on the discard pile face down; the last card is randomly placed back in the draw deck. Each Investigate card will display a letter designating the type of card - I for Informants, C for Cliffhangers and F for Follow a Lead.&#10;&#10;2. Investigate - Check the time remaining in the game and locate the 3 numbered circles at the bottom left of the Storyline card. On the Storyline card, look at the circle in a row with a number closest to, but greater than, the hour marked currently on the Time card. This is the row of icons you must match by rolling your Investigate dice. You may only use the YELLOW Investigate dice to match the Storyline icons, unless you have certain Items that allow you to use the RED and GRAY dice, Twist icons, or your detective&rsquo;s Special Action.&#10;&#10;The Hunch - Roll each YELLOW Investigate die, one at a time, as dictated by your Stamina. You may also roll the RED and/or GRAY dice, if you have them. You may choose any of the dice to roll next and/or when to apply any rerolls. Each die shows four icons and each repeats two pairs of those icons, as designated by a *. Choosing which dice to roll and when depends on your detective instincts. Each die is different. If you need to roll a 5th or 6th YELLOW die, choose one of your current dice, noting its current face, and roll it again.&#10;&#10;You may subtract an hour of time if your Stamina level is at 1 or 2 to roll an additional YELLOW die. This die may be rolled during the Investigate phase and is lost once the phase has ended.&#10;&#10;You may use matching Twist icons, if you have them, in addition to the dice, by removing their marking cubes on the Criminal card.&#10;&#10;If you can match the Storyline icons, you gain the reward shown in the white area in that row. If you cannot match the icons, you must lose Stamina, Time or your currently held Item, as shown in the brown area in that row.&#10;&#10;If you have failed in your investigation, you may choose one icon from the YELLOW die faces shown and mark this in the Twist section on the Criminal card with a cube. You may save a maximum of 4 Twist icons in this manner.&#10;&#10;3. Confront the Criminal - When the 4th clue is found, draw the top card on the Investigate deck and match the die icon shown to those of the 4 criminals on the Criminal card to discover who you must confront to save the heiress. The row of icons shown for this Criminal must be matched by rolling Investigate dice as listed by your current Stamina. You may only use the icons on the YELLOW Investigate dice to match the Criminal icons, unless you have certain Items which allow you to roll the RED and GRAY dice, saved Twist icons, or your detective&rsquo;s Special Action. You may reroll a YELLOW Investigate die of your choice for every 2 hours of Time remaining in the game, rounding down. Match the icons, solve the Case, and win the game!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Each card gives you special advantages, each city gains you more acclaim&mdash;and in turn gets you in front of audiences large and small. Then you choose how points are assigned for you, and no one else. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins!&#10;&#10;As the game goes on you will gain points for entertaining in the largest cities, having the most secrets of a certain kind, and presenting shows with the most flair and spectacle! Levitate has a creative mechanic for turn order so you don&rsquo;t always follow the same player and a wide variety of card effects and player goals so no game will be the same.&#10;&#10;You&rsquo;ll learn from the three most powerful stage magicians of the 1800s. Howard Thurston, Harry Kellar, and Alexander Hermann. They will teach you stunning illusions using technology, sleight of hand, the use of accomplices, gadgets, and camouflage.  Gain points for these types of mechanics, but only the first player to choose those points receives them.&#10;&#10;Be the master of close-up magic, medium sized tricks, or dominate the stage with gigantic effects with elephants and carriages. When one teacher is out of dice, simply re-roll all dice and keep the magic going. Each effect learned reveals a new place to perform and an opportunity to gain acclaim, add flair, or gain points. Your road to the biggest cities must connect.  Then once the show is done, new illusions are placed on the board. As you add flair to each illusion, points are gained each time you show them.&#10;&#10;Some illusions will allow you to control the game, move your workers to new locations, manipulate dice present on the teachers, gain more acclaim, add new workers, duplicate other players&rsquo; cards, and learn certain types of effects instantly.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

They have to be skilled, fearless and experienced. But racing is mostly a true team sport. Hundreds of engineers, designers and mechanics work together to find the optimal Race Pace. The person responsible to lead the team to victory is the Team Manager, and that is you!&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;As the Team Manager of a race team, your goal is to make sure your driver is the first to cross the finish line! Before you start the game, you select a circuit and each player selects a team, a driver and a tyre compound to start on. Set up the board and turn the first weather card.&#10;&#10;The Race Pace (hereafter: RP) is the number of laps that your car can make in a game round. Your RP depends on a number of factors. But basically, the gameplay comes down to selecting an action in each game round and thereby gradually improving your RP (upgrade the car, coach the driver, charge or use the boost system, take defensive actions or make use of strategic opportunities). At the end of your turn, count the RP that your car can make and move your car across the track. But keep an eye on your tyre conditions and race situations that occur at the start of the game round, because they can limit your race pace.&#10;&#10;Each game round consist of 3 phases&#10;&#10;1. Turn the event cards&#10;2. Select an action&#10;3. Count your speed and move your car&#10;&#10;No race is the same&#10;Choose from 8 drivers with unique skills, 8 race teams with unique capabilities and 12 circuits with a different difficulty, tyre wear and weather conditions. Think about your tyre strategy: will you start on soft, medium or hard tyre compounds? Keep an eye on the weather forecast in order to change to Wets on time! During the race, situations will occur that can change the course of the game. From your radio control centre at the pit wall, you anticipate or react to these situations: select the right tyres, improve the car set up, coach the driver, order a pit stop, to use the Boost system, etcetera. With each lap your car and driver will improve, increasing the Race Pace. But so does the competition.&#10;&#10;Do you have the best strategy to win the race?&#10;&#10;Team Mode&#10;Race Pace has an alternative gameplay variant: the Team Mode. In Team Mode, each player manages one team with two drivers, or two players can team up with two different drivers for the same team! The gameplay changes in a way that you can now help each other (or your team mate). However, winning the game in Team Mode is also a team effort, so sacrificing one driver for the race win of the other is not sufficient. This gives the Team Mode a new dimension to the race strategies.&#10;&#10;",

Notably, runs (of the same suit) can end with a 1 tile if they contain a 13 tile.&#10;&#10;The game needs paying careful attention on the opponent's discarded pieces and plan new series according to them, as there is only a pair of every piece.&#10;&#10;The game's namesake is the wild &quot;Okey&quot; tile, chosen randomly between the regular tiles at the start of every round.&#10;&#10;Depending on the last tile a player discards to win a round, they score different amounts of points- finishing by discarding a regular tile is worth 2 points, but discarding an Okey tile is worth 4 points. An &quot;indicator&quot; tile is used to determine the Okey every round, and if someone has the identical indicator tile in their starting hand, they score an extra point.&#10;&#10;Scoring is done in a unique manner- every point scored by a player is not added to their own total, but subtracted from every other player's score. The game ends when someone reaches 0 points or lower, and at that point the person with the highest remaining score wins. A usual game of Okey starts with 20 points per player.&#10;&#10;",

The difficulty grows with each round as the pool of the characters to choose from is increasing.&#10;&#10;The objective of the game is to gather members of the space expedition among the phantoms of the past (historical personalities) and phantoms from the imaginary world (fictional characters). Players need to choose only one phantom card, that is best linked with the generated association key-cards. Each player makes the choice secretly, without discussion with the team. To win the round, all players must unanimously point at the same phantom. To win the game the players must win 5 rounds within maximum of 9 attempts.&#10;&#10;S.Y.N.C. legend&#10;S.Y.N.C. (Synchronizing Neuro-Connector) is a super-computer that allowed humanity to establish contacts with the new worlds using the power of synchronizing minds. It has become possible to teleport phantom messengers of the Earth from the past or from the mysterious dimension of fantasies to the distant corners of the Universe. The experiment requires a group of people who can use S.Y.N.C. technology to assemble an expedition of five phantoms and send them to discover new space horizons. But be careful as five unsuccessful sessions will reboot the system and you will have to start all over again. The key to the success of the mission is the unity of thoughts and feelings of the participants. Synchronize with each other and discover the power of the collective mind as you connect via S.Y.N.C.&#10;&#10;S.Y.N.C. DISCOVERY is the 1st game in the S.Y.N.C. family and very soon there will be new modules available including traitor expansion, campaign expansion, new phantom card sets and new assoication key-cards sets. Stay tuned :)&#10;&#10;",

Players determine when and how to seek combat; to use daylight for smashing carrier air strikes through defending fighters and dense anti-aircraft fire or to use the dark of night for quick and devastating surface attacks using the battleships' big guns.  Submarines, destroyers, mines and torpedo boats also all play their roles.&quot;&#10;&#10;Two to Four players command squadrons of battleships and aircraft carriers and the side that scores the most victory points by sinking enemy vessels and winning sorties wins the game.&#10;&#10;Variations in ship attack, capability, and defense values are represented by using different types and numbers of dice.&#10;&#10;",

Unless the power says &quot;Play this card immediately&quot;, you may choose when to play it. You can play as many cards as you like on any turn and discard them after use.&#10;&#10;Monster - Eight are in the deck. The first 7 are set aside when drawn, but if you draw the 8th, you are out of the game. Place your cards face up where all players can see them. Shuffle the 8th monster card back into the &quot;?&quot; deck as it may be drawn again.&#10;&#10;2 Player or teams do not use the ? cards. With just 2 players or teams, take the top 5 cards from the deck and place them face down next to the game board during set up.&#10;During the game, ask questions as normal. If the other player/team must always try to answer. If they cannot, you look at one of the 5 cards set aside during setup.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "In 7 Kingdoms, players are royal agents who want to collect as many followers as possible. Whoever does this best will win the game.&#10;&#10;The deck in 7 Kingdoms consists of 49 cards in seven types, with each type having seven cards in a particular number range: king (1-7), bishop (8-14), etc. up to peasant (43-49). Each number range has seven cards in it, with each being a different color and bearing a crest of that color. Each player starts with three cards in hand, and one crest card of each type is laid in a row, with one card placed face up next to each crest.&#10;&#10;Each round, players take turn laying one card face up in front of them, then they resolve the cards from high to low. Whoever played the highest card places it on the opposite side of the leftmost crest card, then takes 1-4 cards from those on display next to the crests as determined by the power of the card played. Then the player with the next highest card goes, etc. Any cards unclaimed are placed to the right of played cards, then the row is filled with cards from the deck until seven cards are on display once again.&#10;&#10;With each card claimed, the player can either add it to his hand (up to a maximum of three cards in hand) or place it in his scoring pile. Kings, for example, let you take any four cards on display, while generals let you take cards from three consecutive spaces, princesses let you take any two cards, and peasants let you take one of two cards from specific spaces. Thus, the low cards let you claim first, but put more restrictions on what you claim or have you claim fewer cards. The bishop scores himself, then let you place one of two bonus tokens on the leftmost crest card, reveal another bonus token, then claim one card.&#10;&#10;When the deck runs out or each crest card has a bonus token, the game ends and players score any cards remaining in hand. Each card claimed is worth 1 point (except for kings, which are worth 2), and whoever has the most cards of a crest claims the bonus token on that crest, thereby earning bonus points or doubling his score.&#10;&#10;",
