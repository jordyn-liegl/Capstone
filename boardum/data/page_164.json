    "description": "In Friday the 13th: Horror at Camp Crystal Lake, an anxiety-driven, press-your-luck horror game, players take on the roles of clich&eacute; camp counselors like the stereotypical Nerd, the Partier, the Nice Guy, the Final Girl, the Diva, and the Jock as they rely on chance and strategy to survive five nights being terrorized by blood-thirsty Jason. Coveted tools of survival are just within your reach to randomly draw from a camp bag: cast iron pans, gasoline, cleavers, flashlights and more. Collect them to make various combinations for points and use additional fear cards for ways to escape his attacks.&#10;&#10;You have only strategy and supplies to keep you alive, but the odds of returning safely to the camp get slimmer with every turn! Steal supplies from your friends, take them with you to the cabin, or keep what you find and wait out the nights to be the last one standing!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Mark has taken his love and study of politics to create a game of power struggles, back door deals, and unscrupulous actions.&#10;&#10;You play an activist, a power broker, or the leader of a political party &ndash; in any case, someone who organizes campaigns, games the system and wins elections. Your job is to make compromises, yet always stand by your principles, form coalitions yet still achieve your agenda. To succeed you must herd cats, spin facts into a web of deception, and speak truth to power.&#10;&#10;Enter a world of mudslinging, dirty tricks and the crooks and liars who manipulate the masses, juke the system and corrupt the true believers in order to throw out the tyrants, make the world a better place, and save us all from ourselves. A canny and calculating political operative, you are battling to take over a country in crisis. The old-line political parties are weak and divided, primed for being taken over from within or pushed out of the way. Your movement has captured the imagination of a small but loyal few and now it's your job to grow it into a national force. The goal is to put your handpicked candidate into high office, lead the country, and put your mark on history.&#10;&#10;Democracy: Majority Rules is focused on the retail work of politics at every scale: making friends, forging alliances, outmaneuvering rivals, deceiving enemies, building consensus, selling your point of view, creating a coalition, hiding resentment, feigning weakness, blindsiding foes, and turning doubters into believers. It's all in the game.&#10;&#10;While the game plays 3-5, there is a Party Expansion pack that adds extra components, super supporters worth five normal supporters, and enough materials for up to 15 people. Currently, the Party Expansion is available only on the Kickstarter campaign.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Popular and intriguing military air, sea and ground forces tactics game TRI-TACTICS by Harry Gibson&#10;&#10;History:&#10;&#10;This board game was launched in 1935 by Gibsons aiming to provide an amalgamation of three other tactical board games:&#10;&#10;- L'Attaque (1909) - the U.K. rights were acquired by Gibsons in 1925.&#10;- Dover Patrol (1911)&#10;- Aviation: The Aerial Tactics Game of Attack and Defence (1925)&#10;&#10;All of these Gibsons games, marketed at the time as Series: The Big Four (Gibsons), predate Stratego (1942) by Jumbo which shares many similar aspects of play, but is now much more well known.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;&#10;The game is played on a special 12x12 board which illustrates land and sea spaces equally for each side, and each with two special squares, an HQ and a Lake containing a Naval Base. Two players, one RED, the other BLACK, command combined Navy, Airforce and Army forces, with a total of 112 prices, each player starting with 56, comprising the following:&#10;&#10;Infantry&#10;5 Battalions - rank 1&#10;4 Brigades - rank 2&#10;3 Divisions - rank 3&#10;2 Army Corps - rank 4&#10;1 Army - rank 5&#10;&#10;Artillery&#10;5 Anti-Aircraft gun - rank AA&#10;4 Field Artillery - rank FA&#10;3 Heavy Artillery - rank HA&#10;&#10;Naval Force&#10;4 Destoryers  - rank 1&#10;3 Cruisers - rank 2&#10;2 Battleships - rank 3&#10;1 Aircraft Carrier - rank 4&#10;1 Submarine - rank SM&#10;4 Flying Boats - rank FB&#10;&#10;Air Force&#10;4 Reconnaissance Planes - rank 1&#10;3 Bombers - rank 2&#10;2 Two-Seat Fighters - rank 3&#10;&#10;Auxiliary&#10;8 Searchlights - rank SL&#10;&#10;At the beginning of game, these 56 pieces are placed by a player to occupy the first 5 rows of one side (but not on the HQ or Lake), with the other player doing likewise with their 56 on the opposite side&rsquo;s 5 rows. This leaves two whole rows in the centre of the board empty, as well as the HQ, Lake, and 2 other squares between the two forces facing each other. All types and ranks of the pieces are hidden at the beginning of the game&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to occupy the opponent&rsquo;s HQ with an Infantry piece, or the Lake with a Naval piece (not including the FB), which must approach via the river.&#10;&#10;The players draw lots to decide who commences play, by moving one piece, and thereafter play alternates between the players, by moving one piece per turn.&#10;&#10;All pieces can move one square at a time, forwards, backwards or sideways, with the exception of the Searchlight which can move multiple squares in a single direction (but only when attacking), as long as the squares are unoccupied.&#10;&#10;To attack, a player must move a piece adjacent to an opponent&rsquo;s piece and announce &lsquo;Attack&rsquo;. They may choose not to, in which case they state &lsquo;No Attack&rsquo;. In that case, the opponent cannot on their turn attack that adjacent piece without first moving another of his pieces.&#10;&#10;The two adjacent pieces of each player are then revealed. The attacks are resolved by consulting the Value Table; as a general rule, the highest rank wins, but there are various combinations that apply, particularly when comparing land, sea and air pieces on land, sea or over a coastline. If successful, the attacker remains where they are, and the defender&rsquo;s square becomes empty as the defender&rsquo;s piece is removed. If the attacker loses, their piece is removed, and the defender&rsquo;s piece remains where it is. If the pieces are the same rank, both are removed.&#10;&#10;It is allowed to place Land pieces on the sea and Naval pieces on the land, but with the risk that when attacked, any such piece found to be operating &lsquo;out of their element&rsquo; will immediately forfeit and removed. Excluded from this rule is the FB as well as all Air Force pieces and the Searchlights.&#10;&#10;The River is a special area which is classified as Land or Sea depending on which piece is occupying it. When a Naval piece does so, the square is designated Sea, and when a Land price occupies it, then it is classified as Land. On the rest of the board, where land and sea meet, then the spaces are classified as Sea or Land depending on which is in the majority. The coastline in each case separates these defined areas of Land and Sea. Should there be an attack between a Ship and a Land piece over a coastline, the attacker is forfeit, except for HA and AA when the ordinary ruling applies. Also, Bombers and FB destroy Infantry and FA.&#10;&#10;The HQ and Lake must not be occupied but a piece may be move over these squares in consecutive turns or else be forfeit. Only Ships (not FB) may attack and capture the Lake, and to do so must move up the River (it cannot capture the Lake by entering via Land, or then it must exit via the river to sea); in doing so, in this special case it captures all Land pieces in attacks, except HA. Similarly, only Infantary pieces (not Artillery) may attack and capture the HQ.&#10;&#10;Similar to:&#10;&#10;    L'Attaque&#10;    Dover Patrol&#10;    Aviation: The Aerial Tactics Game of Attack and Defence&#10;    Stratego&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The battle pitted two of the great Leaders of that era against each other: Julius Caesar and Vercingetorix. This began as a Roman siege of the Gallic fortress at Alesia, and concluded with a decisive battle. The game system emphasizes command control. Players pick command markers to generate actions, modeling the chaos of the original battle. The Gallic objective is to break out of Alesia and link up with the relief army coming in from off the map. The Roman&rsquo;s (caught in the middle) objective is to defeat the Gauls and eliminate Vercingetorix. There are two players in the game: Roman and Gauls. The game consists of three Days of Battle. Within each day, there will be several turns based on the command markers. There are 176 5/8in counters, with a 22x34 inch map depicting the area around the fortified village of Alesia and the Roman fortifications and towers surrounding the village.&#10;&#10;Magazine: Strategy &amp; Tactics #312&#10;&#10;",

During the game, loyal Captains must rally their forces to defend the Citadel against the emerging threat of a creature from the deep. Think Gandalf rallying the forces of Minas Tirith in Return of the King.&#10;&#10;This is not a tower defense game, but blends several mechanisms including dice drafting (there are custom dice and rolls can be mitigated), tableau building (the player boards are extra large to organize the various cards), and worker placement (in terms of the various buildings your Captain will visit).&#10;&#10;Your Captain&rsquo;s tableau will include soldiers, wizards, heroes, mounts, and wyverns. Some of these characters are for offensive purposes (attacking the Monster etc) and some for defensive purposes (building your resources including your dice pool). During the game player will also complete quests for the King, buy items from the Town Hall, ride a Mount, fight creatures in the streets of the Citadel, upgrade their Captain at the Armoury, visit the Dwarven Grotto for gold, and find helpful trinkets in the Fountain.&#10;&#10;The game supports &quot;true solo&quot; (a solo player need only control one Captain), fully co-op multiplayer against the Monster, one vs one (one player controls the Captain, the other player controls the Monster), or one player (controlling the Monster) vs up to four Captains. All play modes feature long or short variants.&#10;&#10;There are five monsters included in the game (Dragon, Enchantress, Behemoth, Vampire Queen, and Orc War Chief) both featuring &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; sides for greater challenge and variation. The game engine can be further adjusted with Difficulty Tokens.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "The players try to form snakes, which are as long as possible. A snake always consists of a head-section, at least one middle-section and a tail-section. The player who has formed the most and longest snakes wins.&#10;&#10;The cards are shuffled and placed face down fan-like on the table. One card is drawn from the &quot;fan&quot; and is placed face-up in the middle of the table. In turn, each player draws a card from the &quot;fan&quot; and tries to match the color with a card in the middle of the table. The card can be turned around to match. If the colors of the two cards match, a snake is started.&#10;&#10;If a player draws a card which cannot be placed next to a card or a snake in the middle of the table, this card is then placed on its own in the middle of the table. A card which is drawn from the &quot;fan&quot; can be placed next to a snake to lengthen the snake. A snake can be made longer on both sides. If a head or a tail was already added to the snake, the snake cannot be made longer on that side where the head or tail was placed. A snake without a head or a tail is an incomplete snake. Incomplete snakes remain in the middle of the table until they can be made complete and claimed.&#10;&#10;A complete snake consists of a head-section, a tail-section and at least one middle-section. A complete snake does not need to have all colors. The player who is able to complete a snake by laying down a head or a tail with the matching color next to the &quot;open&quot; side of the snake may pick up the snake from the center of the table and place it directly in front of him.&#10;&#10;The head and the tail with the rainbow colours are jokers. They may be placed next to every middle-section of a snake.&#10;&#10;If several incomplete snakes exist in the middle of the table, a player who draws a matching card from the &quot;fan&quot; can combine two incomplete snakes. The player picks up the combined snake and places it directly in front of him. The player is only allowed to combine two incomplete snakes if he uses the card which he just drew from the &quot;fan.&quot;&#10;&#10;The game ends when the last card is drawn from the &quot;fan.&quot; If the player with the last card is able to complete a snake, he is allowed to pick up the snake and place it directly in front of him. Now the cards in front of every player are counted. The player who has the most cards wins. If two or more players have the same number of cards the player with the longest snake wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Pre-order now on Kickstarter!&#10;&#10;Snake - The Board Game is the tabletop version of the 45 years old classic video game Snake. The result is that you get to see a strategic, tactical side of Snake that you never have. In Snake - The Board Game, you need to plan out every move, growing in a way that is going to block your opponent from doing the same.&#10;&#10;The basic premise hasn't changed. You are still trying to eat apples (or dots, depending on how far back you go in the game's history) to get longer and longer. Simply by shifting the speed downward, Snake morphs into something that forces you to think ahead and get much more creative.&#10;&#10;Curious? Check it out for yourself on our website, and play Snake - The Board Game online against the computer!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "[From the Compass Games webpage]&#10;&#10;Victory at Sea, Original 1992 Edition is a strategic level game developed from Jedko&rsquo;s popular naval game, War at Sea. This two-player game refights the Battle of the Atlantic in every detail. This is a game of Grand Strategy with each player assuming the role of an Admiral of the Fleet and trying to control the sea areas that are important to his nation&rsquo;s interests. The rules are easy to learn, and yet require cunning strategies to achieve ultimate victory. An ideal wargame for beginner&rsquo;s, Victory at Sea also serves as a fast-playing, tense contest for experience gamers.&#10;&#10;The Allied player, although possessing a mighty armada of English and American ships, faces a difficult task. The Kreigsmarine&rsquo;s powerful battleships Bismarck and Tirpitz present a formidable threat. Control of the Mediterranean must be wrested from an elusive Italian fleet. Vital convoys have to be protected from stalking U-Boats and audacious German surface raiders. Oilers in the Atlantic allow ships such as the Graf Spee to elude pursuit whilst harassing Allied vessels. The Axis player has a small fleet by comparison to the Allies, but a shrewd strategy can exhaust hsi opponent and win the war.&#10;&#10;Victory at Sea allows you to recreate every major aspect of the naval war. The game mechanics include Admirals, port repair facilities, the invasion of France, U-Boat technology, surface raiders &amp; oilers, the British Home Fleet, critical hits &amp; damage control, limited intelligence, airpower, mines, and convoys. Components include a colorful mounted mapboard and 117 large counters representing all major German, Italian, British, American and Russian capital ships of the European theater.&#10;Product Information:&#10;&#10;Complexity: Low&#10;Time Scale: abstract (9 turns)&#10;Map Scale: area movement&#10;Unit Scale: individual capital ships&#10;Players: 1-2 players&#10;Solitaire: High&#10;Playing Time: 3 hours or less&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;1 Mounted map (22&Prime; x 34&Prime;)&#10;1 Countersheet&#10;1 Rulebook&#10;2 Player aid cards&#10;Dice&#10;Box and Lid&#10;Game Credits:&#10;&#10;Designer: John Edwards&#10;Project Lead: Bob Cloyd&#10;Project Director: John Kranz&#10;Artist: Bruce Yearian&#10;&#10;",

It goes long back before the history of the usurpation and the revenge between the rightful heir Deforge and the usurper Ken Rauhel. The age of the mighty Titans has ended. The human who are the most prosperous, the noble elves who protect nature, the strong orcs who worship power, the evil dark elves who are driven by vengeance, and the dwarves who are the skillful tradesmen - these five races compete to dominate the world. You will become one of them in this game. Although they want different things, their paths are already laid out by the fate. It is the way of becoming the strongest in this world of grave adventures, glorious victories, oaths of blood and evil treacheries; in order to leave your footsteps in this time of war and chaos.&#10;&#10;&#10;Lineage II : The Boardgame is based on a simple roll and move mechanism, played on a small hex map. Players move around the board to hunt monsters, hire mercenaries and fight castle sieges. VPs are collected by winning siege battles. The first player with 10 VPs will become the victor.&#10;&#10;",

You colonize habitable planets, research technologies, and build a military with which to wage war. The civilization that colonizes the most planets emerges victorious and rules the galaxy.&#10;&#10;Helios Expanse was inspired by a vision to develop a board game that provided a 4X play experience in under sixty minutes, and the play experience was crafted to be as satisfying for the traditional 4X gamer as it is for the casual gamer. This vision drove a specific set of design goals that would serve as the foundation for the game design. First and foremost, the game was created around the goal of being teachable in less than five minutes. This specific goal drove a streamlined decision tree resulting in simple, but tactical player choices turn to turn. An emphasis was placed on player interaction to preserve the game play tension typically associated with a 4X play experience. Ultimately, this combination of foundational design goals (along with a few others) led to an action/movement programming game mechanism that created just the right amount of tension turn-to-turn. At its core, Helios Expanse is a highly interactive game with simple, but tactical decisions and cohesive, working mechanisms.&#10;&#10;",

Fought over essentially the same battlefield as found in the O'Connors Offensive game, Hellfire Pass includes armored cars, Matilda tanks, desert fortifications and armor breakdown. Both players must decide when to use their mobility to outflank the enemy positions and balance that attack with the forces described as akin to a roller coaster ride on a tight-rope. Hellfire Pass is truly a tactician's dream.&quot;&#10;&#10;Hellfire Pass is an Operational scale wargame of combat between the Allies and Germans in the North African Desert in World War II. Uses half-day turns, 2 mile hexes, and battalion/company scale units.&#10;&#10;This game is part of the Series: Battles for North Africa (3W). The other games in the Series: Battles for North Africa (3W) are: Rommel at Bay, O'Connor's Offensive, Hellfire Pass,  Patton Goes to War, Objective: Tunis, Decision At Kasserine: Rommel's Last Chance, and Race For Tunis. Plus Bloody Keren and Drive on Damascus that are not set in the North Africa desert zone.&#10;&#10;",

In the middle of the forest is the Magic Mountain where Morley the Wizard lives.  The first player to reach Morley's castle wins.&#10;&#10;Players are dealt a hand of three cards.  Cards show a monster type and a number.  They are used to move your elf ahead on the path or to challenge another player to a duel.  Playing the right color cards at certain points on the board allows a player to take shortcuts.&#10;&#10;Red spots on the board are ambush spaces.  Players landing there must play a card face-up from their hand and then draw the top card off the deck.  If the player's card is higher than the drawn card, they move forward the number of spaces equal to their card's number.  If their card is lower than the drawn card, they move backwards the number of spaces equal to the drawn card's number.&#10;&#10;Duels are handled the same way, only they are between players and the winner gets to move to the space in front of the losing player (assuming it is forward movement along the path).  In this way players are never really out of the running because they can challenge the leader anytime they draw a strong card.&#10;&#10;",

Each card has a construction point value of 1 to 4 points. Each deck must have a minimum of 60 cards and a deck cannot exceed a total construction value of 90 points. This system pushes the envelope on deck construction and maintains value and interests for all cards within the set &ndash; not just a few select overpowered options.&#10;&#10;Two-resource System&#10;Engaging two-resource system which includes influence and sularium. Influence increases once per round, while each player uses their influence to establish sites on their turn to help build their sularium stockpiles. Sularium is used to deploy combatants, which are used to attack your opponent's sites. The two-resource system in turn provides additional strategies for repeatable game play.&#10;&#10;Round-based Game&#10;Simultaneous combat. The game runs on a round-based system, which allows each player to complete their turn before the round is over.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Welcome to the wild lands of Feorhyrna, where grow the world&rsquo;s most desired fruit&mdash;the Royal Strawberry! Servants of the Imperial Court have been tasked with the mission of harvesting this magic fruit from the Emperor's private gardens. Upon arriving at the Imperial compound, however, the servants are chagrined to discover Raiders from the North climbing the walls, hastening to harvest the fabled fruit for themselves.&#10;&#10;In Imperial Harvest, players build a modular board replete with moats and hedges then take turns drafting a unique trio of fantastic champions who will either raid or protect the imperial strawberry patch. To be successful, each player must master the powers of their respective characters, navigate the Imperial Gardens, evade enemy attacks, and collect the majority of the realm&rsquo;s mysterious, magical fruit.&#10;&#10;Imperial Harvest takes place over 7 rounds (less, if all strawberries are plucked before game-end) and takes roughly 20 minutes to play. A cloth play mat is included in the game box for players that prefer not to create their own modular board or who prefer a quicker game setup. Each character in Imperial Harvest features a basic side (for novice/casual players) and an advanced side (for experienced/competitive players). Additionally, all components (garden tiles, character cards, etc.) are 100% compatible with Royal Strawberries (both games are stand-alone but also expand each other).&#10;&#10;IMPERIAL HARVEST: TAG TEAM (allows 2 additional players per additional copy of Imperial Harvest):&#10;Grab another copy of Imperial Harvest, expand your board, and bring a new group of players to the table! With competitive tag-team rules, you and your allies can face-off against a team of worthy adversaries. By pairing skills and chaining more character actions, Imperial Harvest: Tag Team offers new creative strategies for navigating the board and cleverly collecting those precious strawberries. As always, only the craftiest team will win &mdash; and watch out for those hydras!&#10;&#10;",

If a project's requirements are met the player places the completed project in his score pile. &#10;When hiring, a player takes an advanced filmmaker into his hand from the advance row by discarding another filmmaker of the same specialty. Advance filmmakers have multiple skills and special abilities.  &#10;Using the recast action, a player can draw a new card from his deck by discarding any one card from his hand.&#10;The four types of projects have different requirements. &#10;Movies need skills, based on their difficulty. Tv series need a defined number of skills while excluding some in particular. Commercials need specialties, not specific skills, whereas awards need exactly the skills shown on them and nothing more. Finally, there is also the trilogy in which all players can place filmmakers in secret during the course of the whole game and gain fame at the end according to the skills played.&#10;&#10;After a project is completed it is replaced by a new one from the upcoming projects pile. When the pile is depleted, players play a last round before the era is completed. The game ends after four eras and the final scoring occurs.&#10;&#10;It is a light to medium game, equally suited for families and gamers, and is recommended for players 12 years old and up. Two to four players can have the unique experience of managing a movie studio and each game lasts about forty minutes.&#10;&#10;",

Make clever use of tradewinds to activate your drafted tiles again and again.

On a player's turn, they take a trade tile from the center area and, paying a time cost for it. The time cost is spent by moving their ship along the path toward the next bazaar.&#10;&#10;After taking a trade tile, a player adds it to their tableau adjacent to previously taken tiles - activating the newly taken tile and previously taken tiles in their tableau according to the direction of the trade winds on their tile. Trade tiles allow players to earn new goods from the supply or trade goods they already have for more desirable goods.&#10;&#10;When a player's ship reaches a bazaar, they may sell any number of the goods they have in their ship (to marketplaces with fluctuating values that vary from game to game). When all players have reached a bazaar, the trade tiles in the center are cleared and a new grid of trade tiles created.&#10;&#10;When all players have reached the third bazaar, the game ends and the player with the most gold from selling their goods wins!&#10;&#10;",

Trick round: win cards that will be used in the following two phases.&#10;2. Operating round: operate your trains through cities to generate income and increase your share values.&#10;3. Stock round: sale and purchase shares in the various companies.&#10;&#10;I also invite you to have a look at my &quot;Preamble to 18XX and trick-taking players&quot; (https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3271780/preamble-18xx-and-trick-taking-players).&#10;&#10;Why the title CityTriXX? &#10;I wanted a title that makes sense and combines several of my passions. First, &laquo;City&raquo; for the beautiful cities and monuments to discover. Then &laquo;Trixx&raquo; for Trick Taking, which brought me joy for years and that I recently rediscovered thanks to my friends. Finally, &laquo;XX&raquo; for my economic games with stocks and trains, such as the 18XX series. I also liked the similarity in sound to the word CityTrip, which invites to travel and exploration. I hope this game brings you as much pleasure as I had in creating it and playing it.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Players take on the role of Rome's richest families, seeking to gain the Emperor's favor by creating a network of roads linking the Eternal City to the rest of the world!&#10;&#10;Each turn, players place road sections onto the map, starting from Rome and moving from city to city. Players gain points each time a new road is built based on how many steps away from Rome they are &mdash; the longer the section of road, the more points they score! If the road back to Rome contains a section placed by another player, that player also scores points. Forcing other players to use your roads is one of the most direct ways to win the game, but not the only one.&#10;&#10;The cities themselves also have a value, which will score players points at the end of the game. Players compete to secure the trade routes to the richest, most crucial settlements and metropolises in each region, sorting them by color and value.&#10;&#10;These cities offer up precious resources to Rome's industrious families! Collecting valuable trade goods like wine, oil, gems, and gold, players score points at the end of the game depending on the variety of different treasures they bring back to Rome.&#10;&#10;The game ends when all of the cities on the map have been claimed, and the player with the most points after final scoring wins!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

Six islands are placed randomly around the main island of Port Royale to create a unique, table filling play area.  The ships are large cardboard/plastic stand-ups with spaces for up to 8 counters in the base.  The 12 prize cards are distributed around the islands, each player needs to find the three specific prizes listed on their captain's character card to win the game.&#10;&#10;Players roll dice and use the included movement caliper to move from island to island where they can collect prizes or add new crew members to give bonuses to their ship.  The players use the map card deck to gain prizes or gold from the islands. If they get another player's prize, they can either sell it at Port Royale, or keep it and use its special ability for themselves.  Beware though, the other player can attack and attempt to steal their prize back.&#10;&#10;There is additionally a Captain's deck of cards that can earn many rewards, or cause much grief for the other captains, including letting loose the dreaded Kracken.  Finally some islands will allow you to hire new crewmembers to add to your ship, such as a gunner or sailor.  These can add either 1, 2, or 3 to your movement or fight rolls depending upon their level.&#10;&#10;This thematic game includes simple, full color rules and high quality components.

In this first game in the series, each player controls a Union or Confederate force at the Battle of Gettysburg, struggling for The Wheatfield on July 2nd, 1863. Gettysburg: The Wheatfield was carefully crafted to introduce players to system basics of organization, events, maneuver, fire and morale, with future games in this series promising to expand the detail and accuracy of the Tattered Flags system.&#10;&#10;Since many players do not have the time, funds or eyesight to paint armies of miniature figures, Tattered Flags comes with colorful cardboard counters, called &ldquo;Stands&rdquo; (in the vernacular of miniatures gaming). These games also use a printed battlefield game map in lieu of miniature trees, hills, buildings, etc. Feel free to substitute miniature figures if desired!&#10;&#10;There are three scenarios included in Gettysburg: The Wheatfield, each with its own Order of Battle (OOB), Special Rules, Turn Length and Victory Condition. The first scenario is introductory in complexity and is used when someone is first learning and playing the game. The second scenario is the historical scenario depicting the actual fighting that occurred during the afternoon of July 2nd.

I have enclosed a brief biography of each guest. Watersdown Mansion is an old, elegant stone building situated in Yorkshire, England, and constructed in 1817. The original owner, Lord Balmy Farfrummit, made his fortune selling English pig iron to the French after Bonaparte's defeat in 1815. Roger Watersdown acquired the entire Farfrummit holdings in 1925 after the tragic death of Viscount Farfrummit aboard his sailing yacht, Frummit's Ferry, which foundered during a fierce storm off Falmouth Harbor. Sir Roger, as you may know, is the principal shareholder of the giant conglomerate Watersdown Beverages Ltd., and known far and wide as a jovial host. Female guests are cautioned that Sir Roger, after consumption of his customary evening cocktails, tends to become something of a leech. I welcome you on behalf of Sir Roger and the entire Watersdown Mansion household, and I hope your stay will be a pleasant one.&#10;&#10;CHARACTERS&#10;Dr. Malcom K.T. Praktiss, Miranda T.

The goal is to protect the pirate ship of Captain Black's ghost against all dangers and reach his treasure island in a given but unknown number of rounds.&#10;&#10;After assembling the pirate ship from the box and provided parts, you select the difficulty and activate the figurine of Captain Black's ghost, the electronic game master.&#10;&#10;A player round consists of rolling the die, moving up to the rolled number of spaces on the ship with his sailor, moving and activating the Captain, and solving the present or announced tasks at the location: fighting pirates, sea creatures, rats, fires, leaks or some mini games: blind snatching of items, throwing cubes, push ups/knee bends, etc. If all of these tasks are solved before night falls (i.e., the number of rounds is reached), the sailors have won; if night falls or the ship sinks or is seized by the pirates, the game is lost.&#10;&#10;The Captain is powered by batteries and directed by plastic platforms on each ship location. The output is acoustic.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "In Barakka, you want to collect sets of beautiful Moroccan cards, ideally keeping your opponent from doing the same.&#10;&#10;To set up, shuffle the deck, which contains cards in five colors, with cards numbered 1-5 (and jokers) in each color. Reveal two cards to start two discard piles.&#10;&#10;On a turn, pick up the top card of either discard pile or the top of the deck. If you drew from the deck and don't want the card, discard it on top of either pile. If you do want the card, place it in a pile that contains only cards of that color; each player maintains their own set of card piles. Arrange the cards in each pile so that you can see how many cards are in the pile, but not the number or joker symbol on any card but the topmost one. Your goal is to get all five of the numbered cards (1-5) in each color, although a joker can replace any number, giving you bonus points along the way. If you place the fifth card in a pile, claim the matching colored token and place it on top of the pile to show that color is now out of play for you.&#10;&#10;When the deck runs out, you re-arrange the cards in each pile into a numerical sequence, and you score points based on the length of the sequence starting with 1. If a sequence has no 1, it's worth 0 points for you! Additionally, each joker in a valid sequence is worth as many points as the length of the sequence. Each colored token you collect is worth as many points as the number of tokens you collect. Whoever uses their memory well to collect valid sequences &mdash; while being cutthroat enough to block their opponent &mdash; wins.&#10;&#10;Barakka includes multiple variants that add new cards and tokens to the game.&#10;&#10;",

If the speaker says the word in its response, the team captures that card and scores the points.&#10;&#10;Whenever a team misses with their question, they must add a bonus point token to the card, increasing its value. Whenever a team captures a card, they add a bonus point token to any of the cards next to the captured card.
