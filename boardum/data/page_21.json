You travel the wild open spaces of Kumgath with your mounts, you will use your knowledge of biology to help them adapt and succeed against both the hostile and changing climate and other competing species.&#10;&#10;Players will earn mutation points during the course of the game. The player with the most at the end of the game is the winner.&#10;&#10;Changes in this edition:&#10;&#10;        Initiative is based on bidding position for the mutation/adaptation genes, and tails have been done away.&#10;        Climate change is based on a token draw instead of a die roll.&#10;        The combat die is no longer a regular D6 but has symbols which serves approximately the same odds as before.&#10;        There is a 1-in-6 chance for a stalemate otherwise, depending on the difference in horns, the defender will have a dinosaur removed from the board&#10;            The attackers dinosaur can never die.&#10;        &#10;        Evolution occurs after climate change instead of later in the turn.&#10;        There are 12 climate tokens, delineating strictly 9 to 11 turns, with the game-ending meteor event occurring in one of the last three climate tokens.&#10;        Players only have a maximum 8 dinosaurs, while the older game had a maximum of 10.&#10;        There are 12 new &quot;special&quot; genes, 8 of which are mixed in with the regular genes. &#10;            Each have a unique power/ability such as flying, amphibious movement, chameleon capability for defense, or the ability to predict the future climate.&#10;        &#10;        One event card is available each turn during bidding with the number of players minus one genes pulled out of the bag. &#10;            Winning the event card will give the player first initiative and is only modified by number of dinosaurs on the board.&#10;        &#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Ascension: Rise of Vigil is a deck-building game in which players acquire cards from a central pool, then place those cards in their discard pile to be shuffled into their deck for later use; creatures also show up in that shared card pool, and players can combat them to earn victory points (VPs) and possibly other benefits, such as the ability to remove less useful cards from their deck or to banish cards from the pool that others might find useful. The game ends once all the available VPs have been claimed or the shared deck of cards runs out.&#10;&#10;Ascension: Rise of Vigil, part of the Ascension deck-building game series, is both a standalone game for 2-4 players and an expansion that can be combined with any other Ascension game to support up to six players.&#10;&#10;Rise of Vigil introduces treasure cards to the game system, with all treasure cards in this set being &quot;Energy Shard&quot;. When a treasure card is drawn from the shared deck, you place it in the empty space in the shared pool, then continue to draw until you reveal a hero, monster or construct to cover the treasure. When you acquire or defeat that top card, you also gain the treasure, which is added to your deck like hero and construct cards. When you play a treasure from your hand, you immediately draw another card from your deck; more importantly, you can use the energy on these cards to activate special powers on certain heroes, constructs and monsters. (Non-treasure cards can also provide energy, but they are usually worth VPs whereas treasure is worthless aside from the energy.) Energy available on a turn can be &quot;spent&quot; more than once, so if you have, say, two energy, then you can power up all cards with an Energize cost of two or less.&#10;&#10;",

Over three million German soldiers, most of them veterans of the campaigns in Poland, France, and the Balkans, began a blitzkrieg style of invasion against two million Russian defenders.

    "description": "Love Letter: The Hobbit &ndash; The Battle of the Five Armies is a game of risk, deduction, and luck for 2&ndash;4 players based on the original Love Letter game by Seiji Kanai. The deck consists of 17 cards, with the Arkenstone being valued #8, Bilbo Baggins #7, and so on down to The One Ring at #0.&#10;&#10;In each round, each player starts with only one card in hand; one card is removed from play. On a turn, you draw one card, and play one card, using the power on that card to expose others and (possibly) knock them out of the round. If you're the final player active in the round or the player with the highest card when the deck runs out, then you score a point. In LL: The Hobbit, The One Ring does nothing during play, but it counts as a #7 when the game ends, possibly leading to a tie should someone else hold Bilbo.&#10;&#10;In addition to the one extra card, LL: The Hobbit differs from the original game in that the Baron (#3) is represented by two separate cards: Tauriel and Legolas. When you use an elf's power to compare cards, Tauriel knocks out the player with the higher valued card while Legolas targets the lower valued card. (This change isn't in the German edition, where Legolas and Tauriel have the same text.)&#10;&#10;Whoever first wins 4-7 rounds, with the number dependent on the number of players, wins the game!&#10;&#10;",

We sloths are sitting around, of course, while all the other animals are running throughout the resort. We want to look around, too, and traveling around the resort to pick up tasty leaves would be great &mdash; but running around ourselves is just too tedious. All the other animals are having fun, and we want that, too, but...we are so slothful.&#10;&#10;And then we have an idea: We'll let ourselves be carried around by the other animals, thus getting around nicely. The other animals have so much energy that they'll even gladly carry us. They aren't slothful! Which of us sloths will be the first to get through the entire country and be victorious? We are ambitious, but so lazy!&#10;&#10;Fast Sloths (a.k.a. &quot;Faultier&quot; in German) is a race game that at its core is a classic pick-up-and-deliver game &mdash; except that we ourselves are the cargo being delivered. We are being carried along the whole way and never take a single step on our own!&#10;&#10;You always play with six out of twelve different animal species, and you can place the giant game board in four different combinations. On a turn, you draft 2-3 cards of different animal types from the top of their face-up decks, then you play as many animal cards as you like of a single type. Each animal provides a different type of movement or interaction with you, with ants carrying you along in a chain and the elephant throwing you with its trunk.&#10;&#10;Fast Sloths is a game free from randomness that evolves only through the interaction between the players, doing so without any &quot;take that&quot; mechanisms &mdash; except for you snatching an animal from under the other players' noses because you need to use it yourself.&#10;&#10;Each race offers new challenges for you to get to the different trees faster than the other sloths. Enjoy all 256 different combinations, each with countless starting positions of the animals on the game board...and we are already working on new game boards and more animals for even more fun combinations!&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "The basic game play of Tsuro of the Seas resembles that of Tom McMurchie's Tsuro: Players each have a ship that they want to sail &mdash; that is, keep on the game board &mdash; as long as possible. Whoever stays on the board the longest wins the game.&#10;&#10;Each turn players add &quot;wake&quot; tiles to the 7&times;7 game board; each tile has two &quot;wake connections&quot; on each edge, and as the tiles are placed on the board, they create a connected network of paths. If a wake is placed in front of a ship, that ship then sails to the end of the wake. If the ship goes off the board, that player is out of the game.&#10;&#10;What's new in Tsuro of the Seas are daikaiju tiles, representing sea monsters and other creatures of the deep. Notably, daikaiju can move: each tile has five arrows, four for moving in each of the cardinal directions and another one for rotation. On the active player's turn, he rolls two six-sided dice; on a sum of 6, 7, or 8, the daikaiju will move, while on any other sum they'll stay in place. To determine which direction the daikaiju tiles move, the player then makes a second roll, this time with a single die. On 1-5 in the second roll, each daikaiju moves according to its matching arrow. On a 6 in the second roll, a new daikaiju tile is added to the board.&#10;&#10;If a daikaiju tile hits a wake tile, a ship, or another daikaiju tile, the object hit is removed from the game. Another way to be ousted! The more daikaiju tiles on the game board, the faster players will find themselves trying to breathe water...&#10;&#10;",

But every team knows that to be the best in the league it takes a lot more than players; it also takes an incredible manager.&#10;&#10;Eleven: Football Manager Board Game is an economic strategy game set in a world of sport. Your task is to manage and grow your own football club over the course of a season. During the game, you hire staff members, including trainers, physical therapists, PR specialists, and directors. You acquire sponsors, expand the stadium infrastructure, and take care of your club's position in social media. Among the many tasks on the list are transferring new players and choosing the right tactics for each of the upcoming matches.&#10;&#10;Eleven can be played multiplayer or solo. The solo mode includes six different scenarios that challenge players with different starting situations and goals for the season. In the beginning, the task is simple: You have to climb the steps of the football leagues and achieve the appropriate experience. You may have to manage the club in a crisis, and at other times you will have to rejuvenate a football team of players that are not so young anymore. You may also have to fight against time to try to complete the stadium before the deadline!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Set in the mid-1800s, the golden age of whaling, New Bedford gives you the chance to build the Massachusetts town of the same name into a thriving whaling community. Gather resources to add buildings with new actions and launch ships to go whaling. Go out longest for the best choice, but wait too long and the whales become harder to catch. And don't forget to pay your crew when ships return! Carefully balance time management and timing to earn the most points in this medium-weight worker placement and resource management game.&#10;&#10;In more detail, over twelve rounds players take turns placing two workers per round, one at a time. The town board and whaling board contain basic game actions: taking goods (food, wood, brick), selling goods, building buildings, docking ships, and launching ships. These actions can be used multiple times per round, with the first player to do so in a round receiving a bonus or more goods or reducing the number of goods paid.&#10;&#10;Most buildings add extra action spaces with new actions, combined actions, and more powerful versions of basic actions. You own whatever you build, with others needing to pay to use them and you earning points from them at game's end.&#10;&#10;You need to pay to send ships whaling, choosing how far out to send them. At the end of the round, ships move closer to shore and whale tokens are drawn randomly. Ships that are farthest out have first chance to pick the valuable sperm whales, but as they move in, others have the opportunity to launch farther out and get a better pick, possibly leaving you with only empty seas. Over the course of the game, whales become more rare and empty seas more common. Once a ship reaches shore, a percentage of the profits (the &quot;lay&quot;) must be paid in order to keep the whales selected.&#10;&#10;After twelve rounds, all ships must return, and players total their points from buildings, whales, and extra money. High score wins.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "In Tinners' Trail, set in 19th century Cornwall, you represent a mining conglomerate at the height of the tin and copper mining industry. You must buy plots of land across Cornwall in auctions and survey them for tin and copper, always managing your &quot;work points&quot; and money effectively.&#10;&#10;Once you have a mine in place, it's time to extract the ore and (ideally) make a profit, but the deeper your mine goes, the more expensive the process gets. To reduce the cost of mining, you can place developments, such as ports, train stations, and adits (drainage tunnels), but there's only so many improvements to go around. Once you have made your money &mdash; trying to time the market to sell when prices are high &mdash; you can invest it in industries outside of Cornwall, which gains you victory points. The earlier you invest, the better the return. Can you outplay the competition and make the most money, or will you be left without two shillings to rub together?&#10;&#10;This edition of Tinners' Trail differs from the original 2008 version in several ways. The player count, for example, is now 1-5 instead of 3-4, and the resources on the board are now set up via tiles instead of die rolls to maintain variability while reducing the randomness. Dual-use cards are now an important part of the game, giving you information before an auction or an extra boost after an auction.&#10;&#10;With lead development and expansion designs by David Digby&#10;&#10;",

Turns represent 3 months during the winter and 2 months during the summer, with four Action Phases to each turn.&#10;&#10;Military forces are represented by generals and strength-points (SPs).

To set-up the game, remove three face-down cards from the deck of 45 cards from the game, then lay out two cards face up to start a line. Each round, each player receives five cards in hand, and each turn you either play one card from your hand to the end of the line or &mdash; once per round &mdash; collect the most recently played five cards. Once all the cards from hand have been played, deal out five cards to each player and start the next round. After four rounds, the game ends.&#10;&#10;Some cards have positive or negative numbers on them, and you score those points directly. Other cards are numbered 5-8, and you score 5-8 points for a value if you have more of those cards than the other player. Additionally, you score 5 points for each set of 5-8 that you've collected. And while normally points decide who wins, if you collect all three special cards &mdash; each of which are worthless on their own &mdash; you win immediately.&#10;&#10;The original edition saw players seeking the Holy Grail, with the assistance of various factions. Nasza Ksi&#196;&#153;garnia's version of the game &mdash; Fabryka czekolady &mdash; features the same gameplay as the original design, with players are fighting over chocolates.

As commander, players have the ability to customize, upgrade, and assign famous crewmembers to their fleets, which feature ships from the series' prominent empires and forces as well as special stats and abilities, and unique maneuvers on separate Combat Dials.&#10;&#10;Star Trek: Attack Wing is a standalone game which uses the core rule set of FFGs' FlightPath game system with a Star Trek twist, but is not compatible with other FlightPath games from FFG. The FlightPath maneuver system used in Star Trek: Attack Wing is based on the original game design by Jason Little.&#10;&#10;",

This is a relatively simple bidding and trick-taking game, and one of the best non-threatening partnership games.&#10;&#10;Conventional Euchre uses a deck of 24 standard playing cards consisting of A, K, Q, J, 10, and 9 of each of the four suits. A standard deck  52-card deck can be used, omitting the cards from 2 to 8. Players are dealt a five-card hand and the object is to win three of the five tricks. A card is turned up to determine trump, which can be either accepted or refused by each player in turn. If refused, another bidding round takes place in which each player is given the privilege of naming trump. The player fixing trump has the option of playing alone or with their partner (playing alone increases the scores and penalties.)&#10;&#10;",

The player who will make the best use of the resources of the Nile Valley will win the game.&#10;&#10;Fertility is a simple resource management game that raises tough decisions for you to take. Each turn, you collect some of the riches of the Valley of the Nile and immediately decide how to use them : supply one of your Shop to earn money, or spend them to build new districts, offering you new opportunities. Be wise because your choices are irreversible. None of the resources already stocked in your shops can be moved or reused until the end of the game. But any resource unspent by the end of your turn will be definitively lost. Optimize your turns and choices if you want to win.&#10;&#10;A player&rsquo;s turn goes through three fast and simple steps. They start by placing one of their Valley tile on the central board in order to collect resources : alabaster, bovines, papyrus flowers, grapes or wheat. They then have the opportunity to spend these resources to build a new District tile on their Metropolis board, for opening new opportunities. Lastly, they supply their Shops in their Metropolis by stocking the remaining resources. Any resource that a player has left unused at the end of their turn is lost. So, the aim is to collect as many resources as possible, but even more to be able to optimize how to use them. The game ends after 9 turns and each totally supplied Shop is worth money for their owner. The player with the highest amount of money is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

Each player has their own deck of cards, which they use to match the land type in front of their raven in order to advance the raven toward the end of the flight path. Odin (Loki in Osprey Edition) cards allow a player to take special actions, such as rearranging the track of landscape cards or impeding the other player's raven.&#10;&#10;In this first edition of Odin's Ravens, each player can create a personal auxiliary stack during play, playing cards from the hand now to set up plays in the future. The game lasts multiple rounds, with a round ending when a raven reaches the end of the flight path; that raven's player scores points equal to the distance separating the two ravens. There is also an Odin token that can slow down whichever raven it is in front of.  In addition, whoever has played more cards to the &quot;Magic Way&quot; during the round &ndash; a separate playing area in which players may play a particular type of card &ndash; wins three points. Once a player has accumulated twelve or more points, that player wins.&#10;&#10;The Odin's Ravens (Second Edition) transforms the game into a single race across a longer landscape, with players drawing a limited number of cards each turn from either the Loki deck or the land deck and playing as many cards as they desire.

Whereas in 1870 there are still many clippers around and the good old paddle steamer &quot;Scotia&quot; sails the North Atlantic, sea trade is dominated by the end of this era by huge vessels like &quot;Mauretania&quot;(Cunard), &quot;Olympic&quot;(White Star), or &quot;Imperator&quot;(Hapag).&#10;&#10;In Transatlantic, 2 to 4 players lead their own shipping companies, which transport freight, mail, and passengers around the globe. They purchase new steamships from the market, each of them historical with their individual technical data (tons, knots etc.). Competition is tough, especially in the North Atlantic where winning the &quot;Blue Riband&quot; is not only a matter of prestige, but may also be a profitable investment. In order to let a shipping company flourish, purchasing the best steamships is not enough, if one fails to acquire enough coal bunkers and trade posts as well.&#10;&#10;The game is driven by cards; on each turn, play one card and execute the related action. As new cards enter the game, build your individual deck of cards with new or improved possibilities. The task is to manage your merchant fleet most efficiently. It's a maritime strategy game with low luck, lots of interactive choices, and tough decisions.&#10;&#10;",

Translated loosely as &quot;elephant game&quot;, the name of XiangQi may have first been recorded in Songs of Chu during the 4th century BC of early China; in the state of Qi during the Warring State Period, the name &quot;XiangQi&quot; meant ivory Liubo pieces, not modern XiangQi played by Chinese. The modern Xiangqi set dates back to the Tang dynasty.&#10;&#10;Based closely on ancient Chinese military strategy, XiangQi draws comparisons to European Chess, and indeed, both are descended from the ancient Indian game of Chaturanga.&#10;&#10;---&#10;&#10;XiangQi, commonly referred to in English as &quot;Chinese Chess&quot;, is played with 32 pieces (16 per player) on a board that is 9 lines wide and 10 lines long. As in the game of Go, the game is played on the intersections of the game board. The area of play is divided into two territories by a river in the middle of game board. In each territory there is a 3 line by 3 line palace, in which each player's respective General/Marshal is located. The object of the game is to capture the opponents's General/Marshal.&#10;&#10;The pieces on both sides and their movements &amp; special rules are:&#10;&#10;&#10;    1 General: 1 Point orthogonally within the palace only. Not allowed to &lsquo;see&rsquo; the enemy General on an open file.&#10;    2 Advisors: 1 point diagonally within the palace only.&#10;    2 Chariots: Any distance orthogonally.&#10;    2 Cannons: Moves like a Chariot. To capture, it must first leap over an intervening piece of either color.&#10;    2 Horses: 1 point orthogonally, then one point diagonally.&#10;    2 Elephants / Ministers: 2 points diagonally. Cannot cross the river.&#10;    5 Soldiers: 1 point straight forward.  Once across the river, can also move 1 point sideways instead.&#10;&#10;&#10;Pieces capture as they move and never jump. The only exception (for both rules) apply to the cannon.&#10;&#10;---&#10;&#10;The price of the game varies depending on the material used in the game. Inexpensive sets are usually made with plastic or low-grade wooden pieces and a paper gameboard. Expensive sets are usually made with jade or high-grade wooden pieces and a wooden gameboard.&#10;&#10;Variants&#10;&#10;    Banqi - Game using same pieces&#10;    Giog - Game using same pieces&#10;    Mini Xiang Qi - Smaller version&#10;    San Guo Qi - Three-player version&#10;    Qi Guo Xiang Qi - Seven-player version&#10;    Changgi - Korean version&#10;&#10;&#10;You can play Chinese Chess for free at http://www.xiangqi.com.&#10;&#10;",

On a turn, a player lays down one or more ingredient cards of a single type into a common stack, then optionally adds a pizza order card to that stack. He then refills his hand by drawing as many cards as he played from either the shared ingredient deck or his own order deck.&#10;&#10;After the draw pile is exhausted, the shared pile of cards is flipped over and sorted by ingredients until an order comes up. If enough ingredient cards are available to fill that order, the owner scores it; if not, the player can make up the difference by playing cards from his hand (and thereby scoring the order) or else return the card to the bottom of his order deck.&#10;&#10;Once all the orders are scored or returned, shuffle the ingredients used in pizzas and start another round of play.

    "description": "Nevsky: Teutons and Rus in Collision 1240-1242 is a board wargame about the storied clash between Latin Teutonic and Orthodox Russian powers along the Baltic frontier of the mid-13th-Century. It is the first volume in GMT Games&rsquo; &quot;Levy &amp; Campaign Series&quot; portraying military operations in a variety of pre-industrial conflicts. In Nevsky players raise and equip their armies, then provision and maneuver them to ravage or conquer enemy territory or defeat enemy forces in battle. Feudal politics obligate an array of lords and vassals to serve on campaign&mdash;but only for limited periods. Players must keep an eye on the calendar and reward lords to keep their armies in the field.&#10;&#10;Nevsky is solitaire friendly or can add a rules option with screens that hide what the two players&rsquo; lords levy. A second option adds detail regarding vassal forces&rsquo; terms of service.&#10;&#10;In Nevsky, two players take the roles of &ldquo;Russians&rdquo; and &ldquo;Teutons&rdquo;, respectively. The Russians represent the wealthy city-state of Novgorod and its allies. The Teutons comprise German and Danish landholders&mdash;including the Teutonic Order&mdash;expanding a Baltic dominion.&#10;&#10;The sides every 40 days will levy various lords and vassals and their forces, transport, and capabilities, backed by higher political authorities&mdash;a papal legate for the Teutons and Novgorod&rsquo;s city council (veche) for the Russians. Each lord is rated for fealty, lordship, service, and command and lays out his forces and assets on a mat. Wooden pieces represent units of knights, mounted sergeants, light and Asiatic cavalry, men-at-arms, and unarmored serfs and militia. Assets include counters for transport such as carts, boats, and sleds; provender to feed the army; and coin to pay for longer service or booty captured by ravaging or conquering enemy regions.&#10;&#10;The players then plan and command a campaign for that 40 days with the lords who have mustered. To represent the limits of communications on medieval operations, stacks of command cards commit players to activating lords in a sequence that may or may not meet the needs of the developing situation. Cylinder pieces on the map show the lords&rsquo; maneuvers, while markers on a feudal calendar show how much longer the lords will serve, influenced by success or failure in their campaigns. When lords clash in field battle or storming a castle, players array their lords&rsquo; mats left, right, center, and reserve and attempt to rout the enemy. Various event and capability cards reveal cultural and technological particulars that influence levy, campaign, and combat.&#10;&#10;",

Upgrade them to match blueprints, or just to stack up towering rides that pull in the crowds and make the most cash. Hire staff members and build super attractions to maximise your park&rsquo;s strategy for the win!&#10;&#10;Funfair is a standalone game in the Unfair universe. It's a lighter and faster introduction to Unfair&rsquo;s ludicrously modular theme park building. With fast setup and gameplay, and only positive player interaction included in Funfair, it&rsquo;s a fun family-friendly game. However, new goals, new cards, all new build strategies, and tight combos will give experienced gamers and Unfair fans plenty of challenge.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;SetupThe board is set up with:&#10;&#10;&#10;     a 6 card City Event deck (there are 12 such cards in total), &#10;     a deck of 20 blueprint cards (secret goals), &#10;     a deck of 97 park cards containing attractions upgrades and staff members, &#10;     a market of 6 park cards containing a random mix of Attractions, upgrades and staff member cards. &#10;     an Award card, drawn randomly from the 5 in the game. Awards are public goals that reward players 15 points for meeting the goal.&#10;&#10;&#10;Each of the 2 to 4 players starts with:&#10;&#10;&#10;     a gate card, &#10;     30 coins to spend, &#10;     a randomly dealt but hidden showcase card, a type of powerful Thrill Ride they may choose to build sometime during the game, &#10;     a hand of 5 park cards (attractions, upgrades and staff) they may build later - if you don&rsquo;t have an attraction in your opening hand you may discard them and draw until you do. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;GameplayEach of Funfair&rsquo;s 6 rounds begins with a random City event which helps all players in some way, often requiring interesting decisions about how to best benefit from them, and sometimes interactively with other players.&#10;&#10;Players then progress to the Park step and take their 3 actions, 1 at a time each clockwise around the table, to build attractions, upgrades on those attractions, or recruit staff directly from the market or their hand. Alternatively players may also draw blueprints from the blueprints decks or park cards from the park deck or market, or gain money (1 per attraction they have built).&#10;&#10;After all players have taken 3 actions each (or 4 if they have built their Showcase attraction), players progress to the Guests step where they earn income from the stars (representing guest appeal) on the cards they have built in their parks, and perhaps from staff members.&#10;&#10;In the Cleanup step players discard down to 5 cards in hand and reset the market, ready for the next round.&#10;&#10;Over each game of 6 rounds and 20 or so actions players build a mix of attractions, upgrades and staff into their park tableau to generate increasingly larger incomes each round. But they also build their park to score victory points in various ways at the end of the game. Exactly how they do so will vary greatly from game to game with different public Awards &amp; private Blueprint goals and other strategic factors and opportunities presenting themselves as the game develops. There are many efficiencies and combinations to be found during play, and numerous ways to earn points.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;End game scoringAt the end of the game (after the Cleanup step in Round 6), players total their points earned from:&#10;&#10;&#10;     The number of icons in each of their 1 to 5 attractions (taller attractions score proportionally better)&#10;     Matching requirements or bonus sections on their blueprints&#10;     Their money: 2 coins = 1 point&#10;     Staff members recruited in the game&#10;     Meeting the Award goal for the game&#10;&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

In shifting teams of two that sit across from one another, players try to create skylines on challenge cards &ndash; but the players can see the completed image only from their point of view, so they must consult with one another constantly to make sure each colored block ends up in the right location while racing against the timer. The faster the players complete their building, the more points they score. Then the next team takes a seat, breaks down the blocks, then begins building anew. Whoever has the most points after a certain number of rounds will stand atop La Boca and glory in the cheers of the Argentinian public!&#10;&#10;",

The Royal Navy gave Franklin two heavy Ships (HMS Terror and HMS Erebus) filled with scientific equipment, 1000 books, a crew of 128 men, and enough food to last for three years. They left England in May and encountered whalers along the west coast of Greenland in August. There, they waited for more favorable weather conditions for the crossing of the Lancaster Sound. Once the weather improved, they sailed into unknown waters, and no one ever heard from them again...&#10;&#10;Their disappearance provoked a great deal of turmoil in public opinion, and numerous British and American expeditions attempted to find their trail. As leaders of these expeditions in Expedition: Northwest Passage, players must venture into these hazardous Arctic waters in order to discover Franklin's fate and succeed where he failed &ndash; by finding the Northwest Passage. Players allocate their crewmen in their ship or in their sled to perform various actions such as exploring, moving, or gathering clues on the whereabouts of the Franklin expedition.&#10;&#10;As the game progresses, the seasons will pass and parts of the sea will be frozen, blocking the way for the ships. Players acquire victory points by gathering clues, mapping the area, and &ndash; of course &ndash; discovering the Northwest Passage. However, in order to claim victory, one has to come back home to the Greenland on time!&#10;&#10;",

Possess as many characters from a House as someone else, and you claim the banner from that person. Collect the final character from a House, and you immediately use the power of one of six companions; since the game contains fourteen companions, the mix of powers will differ each game.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "The industrial age has come at last to the World of Indines! Use your ingenuity and the skill of your team of technomancers to cross the continent of Indines while connecting towns and building a vibrant trade network. Research new spells as you carve a path through the many treacherous terrains of the continent, using your company's unique advantages to outbuild the competition and secure supply lines for rare resources.&#10;&#10;In Empyreal: Spells &amp; Steam, technomancers use mana to build rails, and the amount of mana crystals required to cast a spell varies by terrain and by the potency of the spell. Mana crystals must recharge after being used, so your choice of when and where to use each spell will be critical to determining the efficiency of your construction engine.&#10;&#10;The towns you choose to connect to your network will provide critical resources, and the value of these resources changes over time. Some become more valuable as they become more connected, while others become less valuable as their abundance increases. Thus, you need to be wary of what your competitors are building into their trade networks and adapt your strategies accordingly to maximize the value of your stock portfolio.&#10;&#10;Reaching new cities first gives you additional benefits, and being the first to bridge the continent provides you with a sizable commission from your backers. However, those who build first are more at the mercy of changing markets. Time your construction projects to maximize your profits and the flow of mana.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

On the verge of extinction, the humans are saved by a superior civilization, allegedly the Centaurians, and each faction is given a fresh start on a new planet. Thus the exodus of humanity seems to have ended on the planets orbiting the star called Proxima Centauri. When the Centaurians announce their departure, the struggle for power commences once again.&#10;&#10;In Exodus: Proxima Centauri, the six factions fight for dominance in an epic empire-building game, striving to build a new human empire on the ashes of the Centaurian civilization. Each player will build his own space fleet of customized ships and conquer new planets, fight the Centaurian Resistance and the other players, negotiate and vote for political decisions, research Centaurian technologies, and much more.&#10;&#10;Exodus is a 4X game featuring a tech tree, blind bidding on political laws and resolutions, hidden movement, resource management, logistics, and engine building.

The game spans four centuries during which you erect the most prestigious buildings and places of the city. Construction is not enough: you also have to ensure your presence in the great spheres of power. It is up to you and your opponents to build Qu&eacute;bec City in your colors!&#10;&#10;A game takes place over four centuries. Each player plays on average 5 to 7 turns per century. On each turn, players choose one of these actions :&#10;&#10;     Start a new building with his architect&#10;     Complete part of a building&#10;     Send a worker to a zone of influence&#10;     Take a leader card&#10;&#10;&#10;By contributing to the numerous buildings, players acquire influence with the authorities of the time : religion, politics, commerce and culture. Players also help build the famous Citadelle.&#10;&#10;At the end of each century, there is a scoring round where players get victory points for the workers they managed to send in the 5 zones of influence. Qu&eacute;bec introduces a unique and addictive majority rule. The player with the majority in a zone cascades half of his workers by moving them to the next zone. Workers moved in this way allow a player to score even more points. If a player still has the majority in the next zone, his workers cascade again &ndash; a potentially devastating ripple effect. This mechanism illustrates the interrelationship between the great zones of influence. Players must not only fight to get majorities, they must also erect the most prestigious buildings.&#10;&#10;The game ends after the fourth century. Players then receive points for the buildings they completed. The player with the most points is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;Qu&eacute;bec won the Plateau d&#039;or 2007 and was shortlisted at the 2007 Boulogne-Billancourt International Designer Contest.&#10;&#10;",

To win, you have to gamble your relationships with the most powerful bosses in town to win influence. This influence comes in many forms: Law, Money and Force. If you&rsquo;re clever enough, you&rsquo;ll be able to take claim over the buildings in the evergrowing boomtowns and gain powerful abilities. At the end of the day, the boss who has the best combination of wit and bluff will become the most powerful tycoon in the Wild Wild West.&#10;&#10;GAMEPLAY: The game is played in a series of rounds.  Each round, poker cards are dealt between the locations, which are laid out in a circle.  Players place posse members on these location cards, which will both give an action and count as a bid for the location's valuable resources.  Players also get a poker card of their own which uses the two adjacent cards from a location to form a three-card hand.  This creates a clever mix of modern worker placement and poker that drives the game. In addition, players must manage their resources of Law, Money and Force to buy buildings and gunfight. If you have the highest stake in the most lucrative industry at the end, you will be rewarded bonus points. Add these points to the points you've collected from buying buildings and determine the winner!

Was the young laborer involved in this terrible attack or he is just a scapegoat for a dark conspiracy?&#10;&#10;A game of Holmes: Sherlock &amp; Mycroft lasts seven turns (days of investigation). At the beginning of each day, famous characters extracted from the books of Arthur Conan Doyle appear in London.&#10;&#10;Each player has three action tokens that move from one character to another to use their special abilities, knowing that a player can never have two tokens on the same character. Therefore, a character must be freed before reuse. The abilities of each character allow them to obtain Evidence Cards or gain Investigation Tokens in multiple ways. The game has great replay value because it is not known whether a character with a specific ability will make their appearance on the board in the Day 1 or in the final Day 7.

    "description": "Trek 12 is a roll-and-write alpinism game, with progressive difficulty levels and more. To score points, you have to create chains of consecutive numbers from 0 to 12 and areas of a same number.&#10;&#10;A game is composed of 19 rolls of two six-sided dice, with one die having values from 1 to 6, and the other from 0 to 5. After each roll, the player must combine both die values to obtain the number to place. You can:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Add the values of the two dice&#10;     Subtract the value of one die from the other&#10;     Multiply the value of the two dice&#10;     Keep the higher value of the two dice&#10;     Keep the lower value of the two dice&#10;&#10;&#10;Be careful as you may choose each of these options at most four times during a game. After placing your first number on the game sheet, you must place each subsequent number in a space adjacent to one already filled. You try to make chains and develop areas. Players also have access to several bonus elements to earn during a game.&#10;&#10;At the end of a game, numbers that belong to neither a chain nor an area give you minus points. The same applies if you have to place a number greater than 12...&#10;&#10;Trek 12 contains three different sheet pads to add narrative with three progressive difficulty levels.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

A player can lay down a single card, a pair, a triple, or a run of two or three consecutive cards. Each player in turn must beat the combination, with a pair being beaten by a higher pair or a triple. If you cannot or will not play, you instead pick up one of your reserve cards, placing it where you choose within your hand. If you have no more reserve cards, then you must discard a life token.&#10;&#10;Once each player has played or passed, whoever played the highest combination wins that round and begins the next round. If a player must discard a life token but has none, this player loses the game and everyone else wins.&#10;&#10;Combo Up includes four new special action cards, but is otherwise identical in gameplay to the original release.&#10;&#10;",

Pharaohs, The Nile, Civilizations, and Monuments as well as the occasional catastrophe are all here.&#10;&#10;Instead of auctions, the core mechanism of Ra, each player rolls 5 dice and can reroll any of them up to two times. The five dice have identical sides, but different colors - the die color matters in some occasions (eg. a player can't claim purple civilization square with a green die). Then, according to the roll, the player claims some squares on the central board (civilizations, monuments, Niles etc.) or moves the Ra figure, which determines the remaining time in Epoch. One die side is a joker and can be used as any other side, as long as one of the other dice actually shows the mentioned other side.&#10;Players need to consider how to utilize their roll for the best personal gain. Scoring takes place in three Epochs (with monuments only scored after the third) and is nearly identical as in the original Ra, but this time the score is kept on a score track on the edge of the board, instead of tokens.&#10;&#10;From the box: Remember Ra! Now Reiner has added dice to the game and in such a great way. Players still try to score by collecting Pharaohs, niles and floods, monuments and civilizations, but this time they roll dice and choose which to keep and which to re-roll. True to the original game, players must watch out for disasters and each of the three rounds ends when &quot;Ra&quot; shows up a set number of times, so players need to watch Ra and decide when the round may end and when they have more time. After three rounds, the player with the most points is the winner!&#10;&#10;",

Within a short 100 days, Napoleon, former emperor of France, had returned from exile on the island of Elba, again seized power, quickly assembled an army, and marched to defeat the dispersed British and Prussian armies now preparing to invade France.&#10;&#10;Napoleon invaded Belgium on June 15th, defeated the Prussians at the Battle of Ligny on the 16th and after a day of pursuit, faced the British and Dutch army commanded by Wellington. Aided by superb defensive tactics and the timely arrival of Prussian reinforcements, Wellington defeated the French in the great Battle of Waterloo, ending forever the military ambitions of the great Napoleon.&#10;&#10;Highlights:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Mapboard which is a color map of southern Belgium. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Wooden Blocks as counters provide step-reduction and fog of war with no muss or fuss &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Two or three player game - Napoleon can be played by two or three players.

Work, perseverance, balance and prayer have made a small town flourish that has grown at the expense of the cane fields. Today, various clans live in harmony with nature.&#10;&#10;In Bamboo, players take on the role of clans that grow bamboo and use the fruits of their labor to take care of their family and thus add happiness points. This is an action management and tile optimization game that is both accessible and deep. With a very careful setting, Bamboo is part of the Kemushi saga, to which Bitoku and Silk also belong.&#10;&#10;Bamboo games are made up of 4 years or rounds, which in turn are divided into 4 phases or seasons. On their turns, players will burn incense in temples to seek favor from the spirits, and use bamboo shoots to perform actions such as seeking balance, cooking, home improvement, or managing finances.&#10;&#10;Following the doctrines of the home balance discipline allows for better optimization of home tiles, making it a fundamental pillar for progressing through the game. To score balance tiles you must use the balance action and follow the pattern indicated on the tile, which always has something to do with the type of home tiles you get during the game. There are four classes of home tiles: decoration, garden, faith, or useful. Depending on how they place them on their board, players will earn happiness points.&#10;&#10;In addition to managing the household, players will need to prepare for when tough times come. To get through the winter, it will be necessary to feed the family members with the tea, rice or ramen that has been prepared and stored in the previous season. And all this without forgetting to honor spirits and ancestors in the temples. The player who has made the largest offering of incense in each sacred space will receive the favor of one of the seven spirits of the forest, as a token of thanks. Spirit tiles, in addition to helping players throughout the game, offer bonus points in the final phase based on the number of different spirits in each player's play area.&#10;&#10;With accessible and easy-to-learn rules, Bamboo is a very versatile title that will fit into any shelves. However, behind its apparent simplicity lies great strategic depth, with plenty of options available to players. In addition, Bamboo has an advanced game mode on the back of the personal boards, which will give the games an extra level of demand. Harvest bamboo and find balance in your home to win the game. May the spirits be with you!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Each round, players are dealt eight trail cards where they&rsquo;ll draft two cards, arrange those cards in their personal area, and pass their hand to the next player three times.  Cards must either be placed adjacent to or overlapping other cards.  While players can push their luck by aiming to construct long and elaborate trails, only closed loops that start and end at a matching campsite will score points.  Players also compete to fulfill &ldquo;First To&rdquo; and &ldquo;End Game&rdquo; goal cards.  After four rounds, the game ends and the player with the most points from closed loops and goal cards wins.&#10;&#10;The standard edition of Trailblazers features a second deck of trail &amp; player cards so you can play with up to 8 players.  The box also contains two expansions (the Animals expansion and Adventurers expansion) that add another challenging layer of strategy and objectives to the experience.

    "description": "Age of War is a quick-playing game of conquest. Fourteen cards are laid out at the start of the game, each showing one castle and the symbols required to conquer this castle, with the symbols separated into battle lines. Each castle belongs to a clan, with some clans having only a single castle and some having up to four castles.&#10;&#10;A player starts his turn by rolling seven dice, the six sides of which show archery, cavalry, daimyo, and 1-3 infantry. He then selects a card and uses the symbols rolled to conquer exactly one of the battle lines on this card (by placing the appropriate dice on that line). If he can do this, he then rolls the remaining dice, ideally conquering another line; if he can't conquer a line, he removes one die from play, then rolls again. His turn ends when either he conquers every line on the card (in which case he claims it) or he no longer has dice available to roll.&#10;&#10;Each card is worth a number of victory points. You can conquer cards owned by other players, but you need to conquer an additional daimyo line in the process. If a player owns all the castles of one clan, however, those castles are secure and cannot be stolen. What's more, these castles are now worth more points because you've united the clan under one ruler (you) and strengthened your hold over Japan.&#10;&#10;When the last card is claimed, players tally their points, and whoever has the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;",
